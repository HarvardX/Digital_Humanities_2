lord eskorove reporter april         information for charles hutton shipmaster in culross suspender against william palmer of great yarmouth in the county of norfolk and david maclaren merchant in leith his attorney chargers lord eskgrove is to report to your lordships a question with regard to the property of a vessel captured by a french privateer and purchased from the captor by the suspender the circumstances of the case are somewhat singular and are as follow  in may      the suspender sailed from the frith of forth to gottenburg in a vessel of which he himself was owner he arrived in safety at gottenburg where he took in a cargo of timber and iron but on his voyage home had the misfortune to be taken by a french privateer the fearnought of dunkirk joseve magray commander the suspender was taken upon the  0th july      and captain magray having put part of his crew into the suspenders vessel sent her into a port in france or holland the suspender and his crew were kept prisoners aboard the french privateer  captain magray having in this manner disposed of his prize continued his cruise and upon the  0th july he gave chase to a vessel the crew of which upon his approach took to their longboat and made their escape upon boarding the vessel captain magray found that there was not a single person in her but a variety of circumstances independent of the flight of the crew put it beyond all doubt that she was a british vessel and as such captain magray seized her as lawful prize  upon examining the prize he had thus made captain magray found that she was of no great value she was in ballast had no cargo whatever on board and did not seem to be a vessel of much value had she been more valuable than she was captain magray could not have spared a sufficient number of hands to carry her into port he therefore took her in tow and carried her along with him this however proved troublesome and after having kept her in company for some days captain magray took a resolution to sink her that he might be more fully at liberty to proceed in his cruise after he had formed this resolution and when he was about to put it in execution it occurred to the french captain that perhaps the suspender and his prisoners might give him something for the vessel as thereby they would recover their liberty sooner than otherwise they could expect to do the suspender as might be expected very readily listened to the proposition and by the terms of the bargain it was at length settled that the suspender should pay   0 guineas as the price of the vessel and in security of that sum one of the suspenders crew offered to go as a hostage  this agreement was reduced into writing and is conceived in the following terms  the    day of julay      know all men by thies preseants that i joseve magray comandar of the fearnoght provitear of dunkirk have fond a towmasted vasial at sea and not one living soal one bourd the sead ship i therefore should a sounk the prays emedetlay but capt hutton bing one bourd a prisiner i therefore med offir to him for the sead ship for one hundred and fiftey gineas i then askiet him what sukiuratey hi would give mi for the sead ship in whear his boaye replayed he would go for the ship give him tow shilings pr day whill in prison and all thies is troth  joseve magray john merser prisiner one burd witteness john mercer john craford prisiner one burd witteness john crawford   in consequence of this agreement which the suspender consisidered as in every respect to be fair legal and proper he got possession of the vessel and brought her home to scotland upon examining into her condition he found that she was in bad order and stood greatly in need of repairs he thereupon in the full belief that she was his absolute property proceeded to give her a thorough repair and then made one voyage in her to gottenburg upon his return the vessel was arrested at the instance of the charger mr palmer who alleged that he was the original owner of the vessel and insisted that in that character he was entitled to reclaim her the property not having been properly vested in the french captor or legally transmitted to the suspender by the transaction above mentioned the charger thereupon brought an action before the high court of admiralty against the suspender concluding that it should be found and declared by sentence and decree of the judge of the said high court of admiralty that the brigantine or vessel formerly called the peggie of yarmouth now the peggie of culross was and is still the property of the pursuer and nathaniel palmer and ought to be delivered up to them and further the said charles hutton ought and should be decerned and ordained to make payment to the pursuer or his attorney for his behoof of the sum of l  00 sterling of profits and freights earned by him while he has been in the illegal possession of said brigantine as also of the sum of l  0 sterling of expenses of process etc  defenses were given in upon the part of the suspender on advising which with answers the judge of the high court of admiralty pronounced the following interlocutor finds dec       that the property of the ship in dispute must be held to have remained with the pursuer therefore repels the defenses and ordains the brigantine or vessel libelled with her floatboat furniture and apparelling to be forthwith restored and delivered up by the defender to the pursuer to be disposed of by him as he shall think proper and decerns and ordains the foresaid brigantine or vessel libelled with her floatboat furniture and apparelling to be forthwith restored and delivered by the said charles hutton to the said pursuer  the suspender offered a reclaiming petition upon advising which with answers the judge pronounced the following interlocutor having considered the foregoing petition and the answers made thereto refuses the desire of the said petition and adheres to the former interlocutor and decree of date  th december last ordains the defender against the  d february next to give in to court a particular account of the debursements made and the profits gained by him on the voyage or voyages made by the ship libelled during the time he was in possession of her with certification  the suspender offered a bill of suspension which was passed of consent the charger afterward applied by petition to the court for a remit to discuss the reasons summarily upon the bill and the court did accordingly remit to lord eskgrove ordinary before whom the bill of suspension was presented to call and hear parties thereon and to discuss the reasons thereof summarily and to do therein as he shall see just  in consequence of this remit mar       parties were heard in his lordships presence when he appointed both parties to give in memorials and upon advising these memorials his lordship pronounced the following interlocutor mar        the lord ordinary having considered this memorial with the memorial for captain charles hutton and caused call the cause makes avisandum to the whole lords with the whole cause and appoints the parties to prepare informations and lodge the same in the lords boxes against the   d day of april next  in obedience to this appointment this information is humbly offered upon the part of the suspender  the charger mr palmer claims the vessel now in question upon two separate grounds   mo he contends that by the capture the property of the vessel was not vested in the captor so as to entitle him to transfer the same to the suspender by the transaction above mentioned   do the charger maintains that the present case falls under an act passed in the last session of parliament entitled an act to prohibit the ransoming of ships or vessels captured from his majestys subjects and of the merchandise or goods on board such ships or vessels and that on that account it was unlawful and improper in the suspender to enter into this transaction with the captor  in considering the first of these points a general question occurs at what time the property of goods taken from an enemy vests in the captor with regard to this general question which from its nature must ever be arbitrary the writers on the law of nations have dissered widely in opinion and the practice of different states has been equally various thus much is plain that the only purpose of fixing any rule is to ascertain and determine the interest of the original owner and of the recaptor where ships or goods seized by an enemy happen to be retaken it is only in this case that it is of importance to establish any rule for where the thing taken remains with the enemy the original owner from whom it was seized as lawful prize has no claim the only right that remains with him is a right to follow and to recover if he can the ship or other subject which was seized by the enemy if he succeed in this the subject returns to him and again becomes his property but if he fail if it be retained by the enemy till the conclusion of the war his right is gone for ever and never can again revive between therefore the subjects of states engaged in a war the general rule is that quae ab hostibus captae statim capientium fiunt the moment a prize is made the property vests in the captor and all that remains with the original owner is the chance of retaking what has thus been seized by the enemy when therefore the prize remains with the enemy there is no room for any doubt or for any nice discussion as to the time when the property vests in the captor for if it be lawful to seize the goods of an enemy those goods must of course remain the property of the captor where the enemy is not so fortunate as to retake them but on the other hand in the case of a recapture it is of importance to ascertain what effect the capture by the enemy is to have if the simple act of seizing a ship divest the original owner and vest the property in the captor it must necessarily follow that where the ship is retaken the recaptor is entitled to consider it as the property of the enemy and as such to insist that it shall remain with him as a lawful prize to the exclusion of the original owner  to ascertain therefore in such cases the interest of the original owner and of the recaptor it became necessary to establish regulations with regard to the effects of a capture and how far it ought to divest the original owner and to vest the property in the captor upon this point there is an equal diversity in the opinions of lawyers as in the practice of different nations with regard to the roman law it has been a matter of much doubt and of much controversy what rule truly obtained by that law upon the one hand it has been maintained by many eminent writers that the property of movables was not vested in the captor till they were brought infra praesidia on the other hand it has been maintained with equal confidence that the single act of seizing them instantly transferred the property to the captor this opinion voet lays down in the most express terms his words are et quamvis hugoni grotio de jure belli liber   cap   number    aliisque placeat praedam per hosts captam tum demum eorum fieri propriam naturali ratione cum intra praesidia hostium delata fuit arg l t    ff de acquir rer domin l   ult ff familiae ercisc l inii     ff h t verius tamen etiam ante per solam occupationem dominium praedae hostibus acquiri cum naturali ratione dominia rerum a possessione coeperint et uti coelo mari terra capta statim capienti cedunt ita quoque bello capta quae superioribus in eo comparantur a paulo in l     ff de acquir vel amit possess adest certe in host capiente naturalis apprehensio adest animus acquirendi adest justa acquirendi causa in belli jure adeoque concurrunt ea omnia quae ad dominium acquirendum sunt necessaria etiam antequam res captae intra praesidia deductae fuerint et sane ni ita statuas dominiumque hostibus neges donec intra praesidia res delatae fuerint dicendum foret id quod unus militum manipulus occupavit per alium manipulum socium et amicum sed numerosiorem posse iterum auferri quasi id nondum manipuli primo capientis sed adhuc hostium res esset quod utique absurdum est nec repugnat d l     ff h t cum tantum dicat civem per hosts captum liberum manner quamdiu intra praesidia delatus non est quod ita favore libertatis ut multa alia inductum ad res trahendum non est lib    tit    de captiv    but although grotius was of opinion that by the roman law deductio intra praesidia was necessary in order to transfer the property to the captor yet he is equally clear that it is not necessary now among the modern nations in europe with regard to ships particularly he lays it down in the most express terms that recentiori jure gentium inter europeos populos introductum videmus ut talia capta censeantur ubi per horas viginti quatuor in potestate hostium fuerint  this rule has been followed by most of the writers on the law of nations and has been adopted in many of the states of europe it must however be admitted that it has not been approved of by all the writers on the law of nations bynkershoeck in particular has labored with much ingenuity and with much learning to show that it was absurd to make the right of the captor depend upon the number of hours the vessel was in his possession and though he admits the difficulty of establishing any general rule he seems to be of opinion that so long as the original owner has a reasonable spes recuperandi the property should not be held to be vested in the captor and in the case of a ship taken at sea he inclines to think that this spes recuperandi should be held to continue till the vessel be once brought into some place of safety without distinguishing whether she was a longer or shorter space in the possession of the captor  but however much those ingenious and speculative authors may have differed upon this general point in this they all agree that it is in the power of every particular state to establish such regulations with regard to this matter as shall appear to be most proper and best adapted to promote the interest of that state accordingly in almost all the maritim nations in europe this point has been fixed by some particular enactment or regulation in scotland it does not appear that ever any statute was passed with regard to this point but it appears that at a very early period the possession of a vessel taken as prize for the space of twentyfour hours was held sufficient to vest the property in the captor this plainly appears from the following passage in balfours practicks where treating of an ship taken by enemies and recovered by ane friend it is said giff it happens any ship or vessel to be taken be the enemies and thereafter within the space of twentyfour hours to be recoursit and taken again be any of our sovereign lords leiges the said ship with all the guides and geir contenit in her aucht and should be restored to the owners but gif the said ship was in the enemies hands and possession be the space of twentyfours and thereafter is recovered by any subject or friend the samen is just and lawful prize with all the guides and gair contenit in her and fall pertain to him quha recoverit her out of the enemies hands  a similar regulation was established in france by the following ordinance of lewis xiv si aucune navire de nos sujets est reprise sur nos ennemies apres quil aura demueure enter leurs mains pendant vingtquatre heures la prise en sera bonne et si elle est faite avaunt les vingtquatre heures il sera restitue au proprietaire avec tout ce qui estoit dedans a la reserve du tiers qui sera done au navire qui aura fait la recourse  in england for more than a century past this matter has been regulated by special statute in the beginning of every war it has been customary to pass an act commonly called the prizeact for determining all questions as to the legality of prizes and particularly for ascertaining in the case of a recapture the rights and interests of the original owner and of the recaptor thus by the  th of william and mary it is provided that if any ship vessel or boat taken as prize or any goods therein shall appear and be proved in the court of admiralty to be belonging to any of their majestys subjects of england scotland or ireland or any of the dominions and territories thereunto belonging remaining and continuing under their majestys protection and obedience which were before taken or surprised by the subjects of the french king or any of their majestys enemies and afterward again surprised and retaken by any of their majestys ships of war or any private man of war or other ship vessel or boat under their majestys protection or obedience that then such ships vessels boats and goods and every such part and parts thereof as aforesaid belonging to such their majestys subjects shall be adjudged to be restored and shall be by decree of the said court of admiralty accordingly restored to such former owner or owners or proprietors he or they paying for and in lieu of salvage if taken by one of their majestys ships of war an eighth part of the true value of the ships vessels boats and goods respectively so to be restored which salvage shall be answered and paid to the captains officers and seamen in the said man of war to be divided in such manner as before in this act is directed touching the share of prizes belonging to the captains officers and seamen where prizes are taken by any of their majestys ships of war and if taken by a privateer or other ship vessel or boat after having been in the possession of the enemy twentyfour hours an eighth part of the true value of the said ships vessels boats and goods and if above twentyfour hours and under fortyeight a fifth part thereof and if above fortyeight hours and under ninetysix a third part thereof and if above ninetysix hours a moiety thereof all which payments to be made to any privateer or other ship vessel or boat shall be without any deductions and if such ship so retaken shall appear to have been after the taking by the enemy by them set forth as a man of war the former owners and proprietors to whom the same shall be restored shall be adjudged to pay and shall pay for salvage the full moiety of the true value of the said ship so taken and restored without deduction as aforesaid any law custom or usage to the contrary notwithstanding  acts containing similar regulations have since been repeatedly passed by the parliament of great britain upon occasion of the different wars in which this nation has since been engaged  such being the rules adopted by different states the suspender were the question to turn upon that point would maintain with confidence that the charger is mistaken in supposing that till condemnation the property remains in the original owner and till then is not transferred to the captor even bynkershoeck does not carry the matter that length and so far as the suspender can learn no nation in europe now follows that rule it is indeed true that it appears that anciently before the matter was regulated by act of parliament the court of admiralty in england in some instances held that the property was not changed till condemnation the charger has quoted a very respectable authority to show that such was the ancient practice in the court of admiralty in england but it is obvious that this ancient practice cannot in any shape support the plea of the charger for a century past the matter has been regulated by special acts of parliament and put upon a footing altogether different if therefore the ancient practice were at all to be attended to it is the law and the practice of scotland not that of england which your lordships would think yourselves bound to regard the suspender has shown that in scotland possession of a prize for the space of twentyfour hours was sufficient to vest the property in the captor to the exclusion of the original owner in the case of a recapture but in truth now that the matter is regulated by british statutes they must have effect in every case to which they apply without regard to what was the ancient practice either in england or in scotland  the form of condemning prizes in courts of admiralty has been adopted in almost every nation in europe and has been introduced for the most wise and salutary purposes to prevent neutral ships from being seized as prizes and detained as such to prevent this it has been made a general rule that every prize whether taken by a ship of war or by a privateer shall be tried in a court of admiralty where the owner has an opportunity of showing that the vessel is not a lawful prize because she does not belong to the enemy but to a neutral or a friendly state this is the only purpose of condemnation and it has no effect whatever upon the rights of parties where the vessel truly belonged to the enemy that in the case of a recapture the circumstance of the prize being condemned or not condemned has no effect upon the right of the original owner is plain to demonstration and without going further must be evident from attending to the practice of great britain and of france by the prizeact the original owner in the case of recapture is entitled to get back his ship upon paying the salvage without any distinction or without any inquiry whether she has been condemned or not in all cases the british owner is entitled to have his ship restored if she be retaken at any time during the war if the vessel be carried into france condemned there in a court of admiralty then sold to a french merchant and then sail and be reretaken the british owner is entitled to recover his vessel upon paying the stated salvage in the same manner that he would be entitled to recover her had she been retaken before condemnation or even before she was carried into the french port  in like manner it has been shown that by an ordinance of the king of france possession of a french ship taken by an enemy for the space of twentyfour hours transfers the property so as to exclude the original owner altogether in the case of a recapture and yet by the laws of france condemnation of prizes in a court of admiralty is as strictly enjoined as it is in great britain this sufficiently shows that the regulations as to the condemnation of prizes introduced for the protection of ships belonging to neutral or to friendly powers have no influence whatever in the case of a lawful prize upon the right and interest of the original owner in the case of a recapture  in judging therefore of the present question upon the principles of sound sense and reason it seems to be evident that where a british ship is taken by an enemy nothing more remains with the owner than a right to retake her or a chance of her being retaken in which case the recaptor is obliged to restore her to the original owner upon payment of the salvage fixed by act of parliament but if the vessel be never retaken if she remain in the hands of the enemy till a peace it is of no consequence to the british owner whether the vessel was condemned in france or not supposing the french captor had neglected that form that circumstance would not entitle the british owner upon the conclusion of the war to insist that the vessel should be restored to him because she had not been condemned in a court of admiralty the plain answer to that demand would be that although the french captor had acted irregularly and had disregarded the laws of his own country in not bringing his prize before the court of admiralty yet that circumstance could never entitle the british owner to insist for restitution of the vessel which from his own statement of the case from the terms of his own claim plainly appeared to be a lawful prize  this leads the suspender to observe that the charger has fallen into a mistake in supposing that every irregularity upon the part of the captor is to have an effect upon the right of the original owner and to entitle him to insist for restitution because every form may not have been strictly complied with upon the part of the captor there are many cases in which the captor will have no right to the prize and yet the original owner will have no title to insist for restitution for example no ship belonging to any private individual is entitled to seize the vessels even of a declared enemy unless authorized to do so by letters of marque issued for that purpose accordingly if a british ship during a war with france seize and bring into port a french vessel the captor if not furnished with letters of marque cannot appropriate the prize to himself and has no claim to any share of it but the owners of the french vessel have no right to insist that she shall be restored to them upon this footing that she was illegally seized the french owners could not avail themselves of that circumstance and the vessel would be considered as a droit of admiralty and as such would be detained  in like manner were a british privateer furnished with letters of marque against france only to take a spanish prize the owners of the privateer would have no right to that prize but on the other hand the original owners would have no title to insist that it should be restored to them because it had been seized without authority and because the commander of the british privateer had acted illegally in making the seizure  many other cases of the same kind may be figured but the suspender shall satisfy himself with mentioning one other case with us in the case of prizes whether taken by ships of war or by privateers it is required that every prize shall be condemned in the court of admiralty before she is disposed of the reason of this regulation has already been explained let us suppose that without attending to this regulation the captain of a man of war or of a privateer should advertise a prize for sale and actually sell her without using the form of a condemnation in that case he no doubt does an illegal and an unwarrantable thing and the purchaser runs a manifest risk for notwithstanding that sale it must at any time be competent to the owners of the prize to show that she was not a lawful prize that she did not belong to the subjects of france or of any other power at war with great britain but that in truth she was the property of the subjects of a neutral or of a friendly power in that case there is not a doubt that the owners would at any time be entitled to reclaim the vessel and that the purchase though made bona fide could not warrant the purchaser to withold her from them but on the other hand upon the supposition that the vessel did in truth belong to the enemy and was in fact a lawful prize it is not obvious upon what principle of sound sense or reason the original owners could reclaim her merely because the form of trying her in a court of admiralty had not been complied with the very terms of their claim must show that the prize was a lawful prize and therefore they could not insist for restitution in this supposed case any more than they could do in the case of a prize taken by a privateer not provided with letters of marque or in any other case where the forms introduced for the protection of neutral vessels had not been complied with  to illustrate this farther let us suppose that a french privateer takes a british vessel carries her into port and there sells her to the subject of a neutral state a russian or a swede for instance after making the purchase and paying the price the neutral purchaser sails to a british port considering the vessel as his undoubted property could it in that case be maintained that the british owner is entitled to seize that vessel and to claim her as his property because the purchaser could not show that she had been tried and condemned in a court of admiralty in france in such a case it would be an undoubted good answer upon the part of the purchaser that the very facts on which the original owner founded his claim showed to demonstration that he had no title to insist for restitution of a prize lawfully made by an enemy with whom he was at open war and that so far as he was concerned it was altogether immaterial whether the forms of a trial and condemnation in a court of admiralty had been complied with or not  in a word then there cannot be a doubt that the purchase of a lawful prize though made before condemnation must stand good and no law has said that the want of condemnation can ever have the effect to entitle the original owner to evict the vessel from the purchaser merely because that form had been omitted a person purchasing before condemnation runs a certain degree of risk he runs the hazard of the vessel proving to be neutral in which case she may be claimed by the owner that is the only risk which a person who purchases even before condemnation runs  after all that has been said however the present case does not seem to turn upon the general question when the property of a prize is supposed to vest in the captor or what is to be the effect of a recapture so far as concerns the interest of the original owner and of the recaptor had the suspender recaptured this vessel there could not have been room for a moments doubt in the case by special act of parliament by the terms of the prizeact the charger would have been entitled to insist for restitution of the vessel upon payment of the salvage fixed and ascertained by that statute but here there is no recapture and the statute does not apply it is a special case which must be judged of upon its own circumstances which are extremely peculiar those circumstances have already been explained and shall not now be repeated the suspender submits that under all the circumstances of the case the transaction he entered into with the commander of the french privateer was a fair a proper and a rational transaction prohibited by no principle of material justice nor by any positive law which the suspender knows of in entering into the transaction the suspender did not conceive that he was doing an injury to any human being and he did not understand that he was counteracting the laws of his country in any particular if the suspender had not made the purchase the vessel would have been instantly sunk it is a certain fact that the french commander had formed that resolution and was preparing to put it in execution when this agreement was entered into and had it not been for that circumstance would infallibly have carried his intentions into execution that he had it in his power to do so cannot be disputed and that he might have done it with propriety is equally clear in the situation in which he stood he had no alternative but to fink the vessel or to return into port with her for the charger himself admits that the commander of the french privateer had weakened himself so much by sending the suspenders vessel into port that he could not with any safety to himself spare a sufficient number of hands to carry the vessel in question into port  let us then suppose that instead of selling the vessel to the suspender captain magray had actually sunk her agreeably to his original intentions could the charger in that case have had any claim against the captain or the owners of the french privateer for damages the suspender believes that the charger will not seriously pretend to maintain that in such a case he could have followed captain magray to france and complained that he had acted illegally in sinking the vessel he might with reason have said that in the circumstances in which he stood he could not act otherwise with any propriety he would have been entitled to say to the charger mr palmer how are you injured or what right have you a british subject to complain of my conduct were you the subject of a neutral power and could you show that i had wilfully sunk your vessel knowing her to be a neutral ship you might have reason to complain of my conduct and to demand damages from me but that not being the case as your vessel was a lawful prize what earthly reason can you have to complain of me for disposing of that prize in the way which all circumstances considered to me appeared to be the most proper and advantageous to myself to my employers and to my country  the suspender maintains that upon the plain principles of reason and common sense the french captain would have been entitled to hold this language and could not have been subjected in damages to the charger had he actually sunk the vessel as he once intended to have done and as every body knows is often done in such cases but if this be once admitted it must seem extraordinary to maintain that he could not sell a vessel which he might with impunity have sunk or destroyed so far as the interest of the charger may be supposed to be concerned it was certainly the same whether the ship was sunk or sold to the suspender the charger suffered equally in both cases and can have no more reason to complain in the one than in the other  let us suppose that in place of selling the vessel to the suspender the french captor had happened to meet at sea with a vessel belonging to some neutral power a russian for example and had said to the commander of the russian vessel here is a prize i have taken which the crew have abandoned i find she is an encumbrance to me and i am going to sink her but if you will pay me some consideration for her you may have her if the russian had agreed to this proposal had paid the price received the vessel and afterward at the distance perhaps of years sent her upon a voyage to great britain the suspender desires to know if in that case there be any principle of justice or of reason on which the courts of admiralty of great britain could proceed to seize this vessel to take her from the foreigner who had purchased her fairly and ordain her to be delivered up to the chargers the suspender humbly apprehends that no court of admiralty could pronounce such a decree upon the part of the foreign purchaser it would be a good answer to the chargers claim to say that the very terms of that claim plainly showed that the vessel was a lawful prize that she was lawfully taken by the enemy and therefore that he had no reason to complain and indeed no interest to inquire in what manner the vessel was afterward disposed of and that to him it was immaterial whether she was sunk or blown up or sold to a purchaser  if in the present case the charger could say that the vessel was not lawfully seized that she did not belong to a british subject but to a subject of denmark or of russia or of some other neutral power then there might be reason to say that the purchase made by the suspender could not give him a right to the vessel to the exclusion of the neutral owner the subject of a power who had no concern in the war and whose vessel therefore was not liable to be seized but what is the case here or what is it that intitles mr palmer of yarmouth in the county of norfolk to complain that he has suffered any injustice or sustained any injury will he pretend to say that his ship was not lawfully seized will he pretend to maintain that he is entitled to take her from the suspender because instead of sinking her the french captor sold her to the suspender at a just and equal price  the charger has been pleased to say that the vessel in question was not a lawful subject of commerce because during a state of war commerce is not understood to take place between the subjects of the hostile nations and therefore that every purchase and every contract entered into in such circumstances is illegal and void  the suspender however must be pardoned to dispute the justness of this general proposition that war is an obstruction to commerce no man can deny but that it renders void in all circumstances and in all cases every transaction between the subjects of the hostile states the suspender cannot admit every body knows that according to the present practice commerce is carried on to a certain degree and in a certain manner even between nations engaged in an open war of this many examples and many instances might be given if the suspender upon the capture of his own vessel had sent a power of attorney authorizing any person in france to purchase for his behoof either the vessel itself or any part of the cargo when exposed to sale he cannot believe that there would have been any thing unlawful any thing improper in that transaction and if the vessel had been sent home or the cargo purchased for his behoof had been shipped on board a neutral vessel and sent home to any port in great britain the suspender knows of no law by which he could have been prevented from availing himself of that transaction as he might have ransomed her at sea when taken so he might have purchased her after she was carried into port  in like manner if the suspender had been carried into the port of dunkirk if his ship and cargo had been condemned there and there exposed to sale he knows of no law which could have prevented him from appearing as an offerer at that sale and purchasing either the ship or the cargo  thus also if a subject of great britain had happened to be at dunkirk at the time of the sale he would have been at full liberty to have purchased either the ship or any part of the cargo and might either have sent them home to britain or sold them again as he thought most for his own interest  the suspender shall put another case suppose that instead of purchasing the vessel in question at sea in the manner he did the vessel had been carried into a french port tried there regularly condemned and then exposed to sale and that at that sale the suspender had been the highest offerer and either remained there till the conclusion of the war or obtained the release of himself and his crew and then returned to great britain in the vessel he had thus purchased in either of those cases the suspender submits without any argument that there is no principle of justice and no law which he knows of on which the contract could have been challenged the charger admits that if the purchase had been made by the subject of a neutral state it would have been effectual and must for ever have excluded his claim but the suspender owns that he cannot see any reason for the distinction or any solid principle on which it can be maintained that a british subject may not lawfully enter into transactions of this nature the argument maintained upon the part of the charger if there be any thing at all in it must go farther than he has thought it prudent to push it he admits that the subject of a neutral state may lawfully purchase prizegoods but not the subjects of that state from which they are taken but unless he go a little farther the rule for which he contends could have no force or effect whatever for example were a cargo of british prizegoods exposed to sale at dunkirk or bourdeaux the charger admits that they might be lawfully purchased by the subject of a neutral power so as to exclude the claim of the original owner supposing then they were purchased by a neutral merchant he might the next hour or the next day sell them again upon the spot to a british merchant the charger has not said that this transaction could be voided as illegal but unless he could maintain the illegality of it the distinction for which he contends would be attended with no effect because the british merchant if prohibited to purchase directly might do it at second hand by the intervention of a neutral person  but it is needless to detain your lordships longer upon this point the distinction for which the charger contends seems with submission to be founded neither in the sound principles of common sense and reason nor on any positive law which the suspender knows of  without farther argument therefore the suspender upon this branch of the cause submits that there is nothing either in the general principles of the public law of nations or of material justice on which his claim to the vessel can be set aside and that considered in either of those views his plea must appear well founded it only now remains to inquire in the second place how far the present case falls under the statute passed in the last session of parliament prohibiting the ransoming of british vessels taken by the enemy  the history of that statute is well known it had long been a matter of dispute amongst speculative men whether the practice of ransoming vessels taken by the enemy was beneficial or prejudicial to the commerce of this country on the one hand it was maintained that by the practice of ransoming the merchants of this country were gainers because it enabled them upon paying a sum in general much under the value of the ship and cargo to carry on their commerce to advantage and to fulfill the engagements they had come under to furnish goods at a certain time and place on the other hand it was maintained that by the practice of ransoming the enemy were enabled to take many more prizes a circumstance which overbalanced all the advantages arising from the practice in all our former wars the arguments in favor of ransoming prevailed the practice was encouraged and effect was uniformly given to the ransoming contracts the same practice prevailed during the whole course of this last tedious war till      when the subject became matter of deliberate discussion in parliament and when the arguments against ransoming appeared to be best founded and accordingly the act now in question was passed which proceeds upon a narrative that the practice of ransoming is found by experience to be liable to great abuses and there is reason to apprehend that upon the whole it operates more to the disadvantage than for the benefit of his majestys subjects  to remedy this evil it is provided that from and after the  st june      it shall not be lawful for any of his majestys subjects to ransom or enter into any contract or agreement for ransoming any ship or vessel belonging to any of his majestys subjects or any merchandise or goods on board the same which shall be captured by the subjects of any state at war with his majesty or by any power committing hostilities against his majestys subjects  the more effectually to prevent this practice it is further enacted that all contracts and agreements which shall be entered into and all bills notes and other securities which shall be given by any person or persons for ransom of any such ship or vessel or of any merchandise or goods on board the same contrary to this act shall be absolutely void in law and of no effect whatever  it is further enacted that if any person or persons shall after the said  st day of june      ransom or enter into any contract or agreement for ransoming any such ship or vessel or any merchandise or goods on board the same every person so offending shall for every such offense forfeit and lose the sum of l  00 to be recovered with full costs of suit by any person or persons who shall sue for the same by action of debt in any of his majestys courts of record at westminster in which action no essoin protection imparlance or wager of law shall be allowed  such being the terms of the statute it is plain that it extends no farther than voiding all ransoming contracts or agreements entered into subsequent to the  st june      and imposing a penalty of l  00 sterling on every person who shall enter into any such contract it statutes nothing with regard to the property of the ransomed vessel or goods and therefore although the charger could show that the suspender had acted in open violation of this statute it could not aid his plea in the smallest degree the only consequence of the supposed violation of the statute would be to found the suspender in a defense against captain magray when pursuing for implement of the contract and it might farther subject the suspender to the penalty of l  00 sterling this is the only effect the statute could have allowing that the present case fell under it and that it was in force when the contract now in question was entered into  this leads the suspender to observe that in point of fact the statute was not in force when the contract now in question was entered into upon the   th july      it is indeed true that the act declares that from and after the  st june      it shall not be lawful for any of his majestys subjects to ransom etc but then it is equally true that the act contains a clause of limitation by which it is provided that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to make void any contract or agreement which shall be entered into or any bill note or other security which shall be given by any master of a captured ship or vessel or by any other person or persons on board or belonging to the same for ransom thereof or of any merchandise or goods on board said ship or vessel or to inflict any penalty upon any master of any captured ship or vessel or any other person or persons on board belonging to the same for ransoming or entering into any contract or agreement for ransoming such ship or vessel or merchandises or goods on board the same until after the expiration of two months after the passing of this act for any ship or vessel sailing from any foreign european port or until after the expiration of four months from the passing of this act for any ship or vessel sailing from any foreign port out of europe  the present case falls directly under this clause the suspender sailed from the frith of forth in may      to gottenburg before this act had passed he took in his cargo there and on his return was taken on the  0th of july and on the   th of july within the two months from the  st of june entered into the contract now in question  the charger has attempted to maintain that the clause of limitation does not apply to the present case because his vessel sailed from a british and not from a foreign port but this circumstance seems to be of little moment the cause of the limitation in the act was the evident hardship of subjecting persons to high penalties who were ignorant of the regulations introduced by the act and who thought they were doing a proper and a legal thing which had been encouraged by all former laws as beneficial to the trade and to the commerce of this country in judging therefore of the present question your lordships will take into your consideration the situation of the suspender who entered into the contract and will not inquire whether the hulk of the vessel which was the subject of that contract sailed from a british or from a foreign port  suppose the french privateer had taken the vessel now in question before he had sent the suspenders vessel into port it must be admitted that it would have been lawful in the suspender to ransom his own vessel because she had sailed from a foreign port and therefore under the authority of the clause of limitation in the act of parliament he was entitled to ransom her in that situation might not the commander of the french privateer have said with great propriety to the suspender there is a cargo on board your vessel which i wish to carry into france and therefore i will not ransom her but here is another prize in which there is no cargo and which the crew have abandoned i will therefore allow you to purchase her if you incline to do so the suspender submits without any argument that there is nothing in the act of parliament founded on by the charger to have prevented the suspender in the case supposed to take this prize which the crew had abandoned instead of his own vessel which the captor wished rather to detain to all this it may be added that in no view of the case the statute can affect the present question because the object of it certainly was to prevent the masters and owners of vessels captured from ransoming their own ships and not to prevent third parties from afterward purchasing such vessels  the suspender has detained your lordships longer than perhaps was necessary on this branch of the cause he was led to do so from this circumstance that from the proceedings in the court of admiralty it appears that this statute was the chief ground on which judgment was given in that court in favor of the charger but now that the terms of the statute have been explained the suspender is advised that it is impossible upon any solid principle to maintain that it can have any influenee whatever in the decision of the present question  the charger has been at some pains to show that supposing his claim to the property of the ship to be sustained he would not be liable to defray either the expense incurred by the suspender in repairing her or to relieve the suspender from the obligation he came under to the commander of the french privateer  upon this point the suspender does not propose at present to trouble your lordships with any argument he declines doing it for two reasons  st because he hopes he has shown to the full conviction of your lordships that he has an undoubted right to the property of the vessel  d that should the reverse be found he holds it to be so clear that he is entitled to be indemnified that it would be unnecessary to trouble your lordships with any argument upon the point had it not been for the transaction entered into between the suspender and the commander of the french privateer the vessel in question would instantly have been sunk if therefore she be now to be restored to the charger he is by every principle of justice bound to relieve the suspender of the consequences of that transaction  upon this head it may be proper to mention that at the time when the charger arrested the vessel the suspender was raising money and taking the proper steps to pay the stipulated price in order to relieve masterton the hostage he was advised however upon the chargers entering his claim to proceed no farther till the point of right as to the property of the vessel should be decided because if the charger prevailed it would then be incumbent on him to fulfill the obligation the suspender had come under in the mean time an action was commenced in the court of admiralty at the instance of masterton in which he concluded that the suspender should be decerned and ordained by sentence and decree of the judge of our said high court of admiralty instantly to make payment to the complainer james masterton as attorney for or having power from the complainer peter masterton the foresaid sum of   0 guineas sterling with the interest that may be due thereon to the end that the said peter masterton may be thereby relieved from his imprisonment as a hostage  the charger has been pleased to insinuate that this action was brought by some collusion between masterton and the suspender but it is difficult to discover how this action could afford any aid to the suspender in the question depending between him and the charger that in fact there was no collusion is most certain the action was raised by a brother of mastertons in consequence of a letter from him dated dunkirk prison   d august      before the charger had entered his claim to this vessel and when there was no prospect that the present question would ever have arisen that letter was produced by mastertons brother as his authority for carrying on the action against the suspender  the suspender in the action at mastertons instance against him gave in defenses in which he acknowledged the justness of the pursuers title to insist that the obligation the suspender had come under to the commander of the french privateer should be implemented in order that the pursuer masterton might obtain his liberation but while the suspender acknowledged this in the most explicit terms and admitted that the terms of the obligation were as stated by the pursuer so far as respected the price of the vessel the suspender in justice to himself submitted that it would be proper to it procedure in the action at the instance of masterton till the decision of the question in the case of palmer because upon the event of that question it would depend whether the charger or the suspender would be obliged to fulfill that obligation the judge however of the high court of admiralty saw the matter in a very different light from that in which it had been viewed by the parties and was of this date dec        pleased to pronounce the following interlocutor having advised process defenses answers and writs produced and having considered that the pursuer peter masterton agreed to become a hostage posterior to the date of the statute prohibiting the ransoming of ships or vessels captured from his majestys subjects etc finds that the present action at his instance cannot be sustained therefore dismisses the same and decerns to this interlocutor the judge afterward adhered whether masterton will be advised to acquiesce in this judgment or whether it would appear to your lordships to be well founded if brought under your review the suspender cannot pretend to say if he has given a just interpretation of the statute the admiral has proceeded upon a mistake in supposing that that statute applied to the present case but be that as it may if the suspender prevail in the question with mr palmer he will never attempt to avail himself of the judgment of the admiral assoilzieing him from the action at the instance of masterton if the suspender prevail in the present question he must consider himself as under a moral obligation to relieve masterton by fulfilling his obligation to the commander of the french privateer that the suspender will think himself bound to do by every rule of justice if he prevail in the present question if on the other hand the charger should contrary to the suspenders expectations prevail it would be equally incumbent upon him to fulfill that obligation in consequence of which alone his vessel has been preserved  the suspender shall not detain your lordships longer upon considering the whole circumstances of this case he humbly hopes you will be of opinion that his plea is founded upon the plain principles of common justice and that neither by the statute founded on by the charger nor by any other law in this country the transaction now in question can be considered as illegal or improper  in respect whereof etc alex abercromby
