parents shed their childrens blood smollett printed for pratt and clinch bath and r baldwin london  m dcc lxxx  emma corbett letter c to emma corbett ungrateful emma perverse and insensate child you merit neither the pangs you cost me nor the tenderness you receive from me i gave you a reason cogent enough to have weaned a worthy girl from a thousand hammonds to that i might have added the sudden departure of a generous friend who i now tell you for i can hold no longer would have laid his fortune at your feet this indeed you must have seen since nothing but the most extreme stupidity could remain ignorant of those attentions which for many weeks past have been lavished upon you by sir robert raymond a man oh inconsiderate who saved thy aged father in the very crisis of his misfortunes and too delicate to demand as a debt the tender returns of love which he would have sued for as a favor is gone almost brokenhearted away i had promised to conceal his confidence but you extort it from me nay you continue still to dote upon the wretch who is fighting against all the best and dearest connexions of your family i will not endure it you assume the language of decision and call it the sentiment of reason you set yourself up as  judge and lift your womans voice against the sacred principles of patriot and parent it is not to be borne let me hear no more on the subject cease your threats about daggers darts and death i look down upon such romance forbear to urge me you are not to learn the touches of my temper my principles are not less sacred than your passion your principles what are they airy nothings mine are the solemn affections of a lover of his country and a detester of its oppressors a detester of henry hammond why will you drive me to this i know nothing of his wounds but if he has received some there is reason to suppose he has given more at least his bloody endeavors cannot have been wanting and every one is in the bosom of your fathers native land your affection is that of a girl whimpering after a boy is this an affection to be brought in competition with that glorious fire which the love of liberty and an abhorrence as settled as it is sublime of rights usurped and says broken is your puerile yet headstrong inclination worthy to be brought into consideration with the passion that fills the breast and fires the soul of your afflicted and offended father  charles corbett  letter ci to louisa corbett the characters of my pen will discover to you the condition of my heart sickness sorrow distraction and despair are the apologies i have to offer for silence do not grieve for the news you sent or rather that you sent me such news it inspires a thought whose influence chears me but i want health oh that i could recover  that i could gain but a little strength  enough writing will exhaust me i must nurse myself a new cause of sorrow too sir robert raymond has  generous man how i feel for him  louisa adieu pray for my recovery i

pity and protection be upon them emma bent on her knee offers this prayer to her maker it is her legacy it is her last leave of love and sisterhood  adieu adieu adieu emma  letter civ to sir robert raymond o raymond raymond my oldest friend my truest companion pity ah pity the anguish of a father  pity a parent whose persecutions have driven away his child emma has eloped heaven knows where she has wandered under pretense of visiting a friend near town she went in one of the public stages with intent as she said to return in the evening the friend whom she pretended to visit was mrs arnold of richmond on whom she had often called in a neighbourly way i remained therefore perfectly unalarmed till twilight a tempest of thunder and lightening happening about nine oclock i sent over a servant to mrs arnolds imagining she might be afraid to come through it alone the servant returned from mrs arnold with news that emma called there for a few minutes by way of morning ride but went away in a great hurry it was near midnight before i received these horrid tidings and then i ordered my horses to be harnessed and went at full speed to every house where the stages set up the people were all in bed and i obtained answers to my questions with difficulty none were satisfactory i traversed the streets in a distracted manner for oh you know how i dote upon emma i could not give the coachman any direction and he continued dragging me about but i bid him go any where rather than to my own house no trace  no clue  no glimmering of hope hardhearted girl what though i urged her to forget the ungenerous henry am not i her father but i will be calm i will cut her from my affections for ever i am just got home it is daybreak the servants are all dispersed to hunt after a runaway girl what a dreadful morning the hemisphere is in a blaze  the wind blows hard  the firmament opens its flaming breast  i see into its bowels i am sitting all alone oh my heart what a thunderclap was there  it is now rolling along the sphere oh emma emma my daughter  my child  my darling  where where art thou another wonderworking god behold a contrite parent upon his knees lame and decrepid as he is to supplicate a covering for the beloved fugitive perhaps raymond our poor disconsolate  the mutual joy of our hearts  perhaps some sudden stroke of  i dare not turn imagination that horrible way no no emma is at last disobedient she is base she has abused her father she   wherefore do not my servants return villains how dare they sport with a sorrow like mine they know not what it is to be a parent  alas i rave they have not been long gone from me and were they already to come back i should banish them from my presence for ever i know not what i would have i only know oh raymond that the universe cannot contain a more unhappy man than  charles corbett  letter cv to c corbett esquire as your letter arrived i was about to send to you an express i have heard from emma oh my friend you must arm yourself with fortitude the post brought me the nclosed about an hour before dark emma lives is recovering  for the rest prepare yourself prepare yourself to hear of fidelity heroism and resolution which claim admiration even from us whom they afflict whatever be their issue  i perceive that the present state of your mind my dear unhappy corbett too much resembles my own for my company to serve you let us try the force of separate reflection  read the letter of our beloved wanderer and tell me what is to be done  yours robert raymond  letter cvi to sir robert raymond the enclosure from emma  sir i claim the assistance of a man whom i know to be generous who honors me with his esteem and whom i venerate for the ancient friendship that has long united our families by the powerful force of all these feelings i conjure you on the receipt of this letter to visit my father assure him that his dear dear image lives unimpaired in my heart tell him that my absenting myself in this manner is not the truant trick of a girl who triumphs in the vexation of a parent but proceeds from a motive most virtuous most irresistible most conscientious  from a duty that appeals to my heart my senses and my soul o let him not think that i glory in the necessity which takes me one moment from him i lament i weep i mourn over it i could wish that each duty went hand in hand and that some of their objects did not lie so wide apart from others superior to every deceit i would have consulted my father even on the present measure but he will recollect the terror into which his late conversations threw me and will then be convinced how impossible it was to risque such an ecclaircissment yet even now i will forbear to justify my departure because i would suffer some reproach myself rather than try to establish an irregular example but the power who is giving me strength to sustain the great business i am about to undertake has placed in my bosom something which reconciles me to the enterprise oh sir robert there is a duty which must be performed  at least attempted nature reason honor and faith the most hallowed all stir within me nay god himself at the marking of whose awful name i bow seems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approbation i may seem to be romantic when i mean only to show myself sincere all sort of research will be vain i would not have yielded to the least semblance of a scheme which is most terrible to my nature could it by any means have been avoided my father will call to mind certain sentiments and do me justice in his own dear bosom on this occasion  sir robert raymond i ever desired to be uniform and to reconcile the distinct parts of my conduct with the whole yet i will bear up against the charge of impropriety in this one instance for the sake of  but further explanation is unnecessary go then oh amiable mediator betwixt parent and child  go and plead my cause in all the eloquence of friendship obtain for me the paternal pardon  sustain his heart and do not leave him a prey to sorrow  excuse my forbearing to give you my address pity the concealments which are thus imposed be it sufficient that i will continue to send you accounts of myself at every opportunity  oh farewell emma corbett  letter cvii to sir robert raymond your letter sir robert with its dear and dreadful enclosure came to hand it is now before my eyes which are streaming in penitence for the phrenzy which has banished my daughter i now behold the whole matter too plain oh my friend i treated the most dutiful of children with unwonted harshness and in the patriot i extinguished the parent i expected that a soul like emmas should circumscribe itself within the pale of politics curse on the rage of party execrated be the tyranies of war ah what are causes countries worlds to the loss of one dear child adorned with the virtues of emma corbett blind doting zeal what have thou to do with an old mans heart what with the sacred season of the silver hair is mine an age to engage in these tumultuous subjects no i should have taken my darling daughter to my bosom and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fervently for the returning embrace of a divided people that would have been true patriotism and true philanthropy instead of which dolt and dotard as i was i mixed with hotheaded giddiness in the affray i interested myself in every fugitive breath of vague intelligence and while i talked of justice i was encouraging slaughter wholly forgetting or too bloodthirsty to remember that either army is composed of kindred and of countrymen behold raymond how i am punished but where where all this time is emma no date no address a young creature unfriended alone of a delicate frame and harrassed by fatigue sick also never used to travel unattended  oh heaven but she will return the thought makes me easier let me indulge it how tender will i be to her  with what fondness will i hang upon her neck and hide her blushes in my bosom  how will i talk  how soothe  how console her  oh i will kiss her into confidence and composure i will even converse  pardon me sir robert pardon the effusions of a repenting heart  i will even converse upon her darling theme  the name of henry shall be mentioned and if it does her good not without tenderness alas what has the youth done but  yes yes emma will return she must she shall the slender and trembling thread of my being is sustained by no other hope  i have sent advertisements to the papers inviting her home describing person circumstances and situations but concealing names i have dispatched various messengers to all the ports to have her tenderly entreated almost cordially controuled should her romantic nature  for oh i suspect she meditates  was there ever any thing so wild  but she will never be able to carry it into execution and i will not even suppose it practicable she will return i shall recover the treasure of my age but the interim is anguish  oh hasten my friend to soften it i am sick and emma is not at my side i see her not at the harpsichord  i hear not her enchanting voice  i contemplate not her lovely features  all all the exact images of her dear mother  her mother who would shudder in her grave were she   a servant enters to tell me there is nothing but her own little moneybox missing her clothes are all above stairs i dare not go to look at them i dare not open the door of her chamber it would certainly be my death  charles corbett  letter cviii to frederick berkley esquire i am not sorry you found it inconvenient to meet me objects of gloom i know are intolerable to you castleberry at present affords little else i used my friend to fly from these as assiduously as yourself yet now they are become very dear i love the solitude which this scene affords me it was lately adorned by the society of emma ah elegant and hapless girl she has not only eloped but engaged me to justify the step she has taken to her father oh frederick her language is so sweet her power over me so resistless and her firm affection for this happy hammond this heroic rival so respectable that my whole soul yields implicit obedience to the very desires which involve me in despair what of things possible would i not do to secure to her but one moments happiness alas my friend sincerely as i know you love me i dare not tell you all that i intend to do yet consider a young creature about to venture on the wild and uncertain ocean moved by a sacred impulse in favor of a worthy lover who has himself left a blooming mistress whose society he consents to sacrifice to his country consider also this lover as one who is the choice of emma and is every way suitable to her in person as in age  when you have maturely weighed these circumstances then tell me what at my age and under my circumstances i ought to do my friend no man knows what virtue or what energy there is in him till after the hour of serious exertion  there is a project berkley rolling in my mind and if on a little more reflection i can reconcile it wholly to the dictate that uniformly sways me i shall undertake something that will excite your ridicule but for any thing of that kind i shall be prepared i have only two great powers to consult my reason and my conscience what they inspire can never be laughed away laugh then but do not forget that your mirth is at the expense of a friend who is seriously unhappy  adieu robert raymond  letter cix to louisa corbett portsmouth i am writing in a common publichouse at this town from whence in about half an hour i shall set off for america i am resolved to perform this voyage at all hazards do not dear louisa accuse me of wanting confidence because i did not acquaint you with my design i could never support the idea of involving a friend in the perils of a trust which may produce altercation in the issue when the soul is settled in its plan it is useless to ask advice and to enjoin secrecy in any family matter is generally to embroil the person entrusted with some part of it or another  the haste and agitation in which i write is not to be expressed the house is crowded with sailors and their parting friends i am equipped with a proper disguise no matter what embarrassments i have had to procure or to put it on the wind does not allow me leisure for descriptions i am going as a cabin passenger in a vessel called the henry the very sound of the name affects me with a sweet superstition a boat is coming from the ship to take me on board and the captain is already here pouring brandy down his throat as if it were so much water i sport thus with circumstances to take all our grief away upon my account o my beloved sister for you see i am equal to the task the boatmen appear they tell me the gales are favorable the first view of the ocean is awful but it leads to henry  adieu the mariners are impatient they call me fairweather sailor which is a joke levelled purely at my complexion but they have no suspicion of emma oh farewell they hurry me i must fold up the letter  i must bid you indeed adieu  emma  letter cx to frederick berkley esquire frederick i am now resolved away selfish weaknesses  away all that is unbecoming the period of my life come onward ye powers of more suitable attachment come divinest image of graceful and honorable friendship  come and possess me wholly  berkley i have made up my mind and it is easier my spirit settles i recover from the giddiness of passion and rise to more disinterested joys in which the appetites have no share  adieu my friend i am preparing again for sea you guess my destination i follow the fortunes of the incomparable emma in her tender pilgrimage over the waves there by this time floats the fair and faithful fugitive my servant is packing up  oh let me go catch the disconsolate corbett by the hand and linger not another moment  robert raymond  letter cxi to sir robert raymond you were scarce gone twenty minutes my most generous raymond ere a letter came to hand by private conveyance  a letter my friend whose contents  oh sir robert i sink under the double conflict of delight and of despair  inexplicable providence i have yet a son edward still lives at this tumultuous moment i am dropping the fathers tear upon the blessed paper that presents the news oh for some few months of firmer health this unmitigable disorder which chains me to the chamber and the chair go then my friend  go most admirable most excellent fly to my children ah that a parents heartheaved sighs could speed your vessel on its way god give it swiftness happily you may yet see and yet save my children  oh if you should    forgetting all agony i have dropped involuntarily upon my knee to enforce the prayer   oh if you should i conjure you to exert yourself tell emma i relent i yield to her pleading softness  i am no more the mad patriot  i am henceforth all the parent tell edward that i adore his virtue but tremble for his life tell him enough of civil blood will be shed without swelling the current by any stream from his veins bid him then yield up the  ah heaven what am i about to say  he cannot remain neuter all things forbid it  his honor  his principles  his life  his soul  his country   what raymond shall i do and whither shall i turn what are my late misfortunes to compare with these my son and my daughter both both taken from me yet go my friend this follows you by express if i never see you more farewell for ever  charles corbett  letter cxii edward corbett to his father after having been thirteen months agonized amongst the wounded and more than once considered as the prize of death i am at length able to write a few lines to acquaint you that i exist by which information i flatter myself i shall make a father a sister and a friend most happy the arm and shoulder which were wounded are at length cured without amputation but the half of the left cheek is gone these tidings i had caused to be conveyed to england long since by letters sent at different opportunities by various means of conveyance but as i have not received your replies i fear either those miscarried or mine have never reached you indeed war puts a dreadful stop to this branch of communication although the only one which can relieve the pains of so prilous an absence  washington offers me the mean of future retreat and inactivity  consideration i suppose of my fears but i am now too far engaged to accept this with any honor i wish it may be no more necessary to fire and they talk indeed of peace but there is no real prospect of such a blessing being at hand i fought at first in my own defense and must i fear continue to do so still the english persist to call those cowards whom they prove to be men and feel to be heroes tomorrow i shall once more fix the bayonet and shoulder the musket every man fights in this country we arm not for pay but for property not for the wages of war but for liberty and life  wherefore does my old friend henry stay idling at home now half the youth of europe are in arms why does he not take one side or the other as principle directs he was wont to maintain with me warm disputes in favor of great britain but by this time his opinion must be changed and the cause of america must be dear to him were it only in respect of her youth her bravery and her misfortunes tell him i should be glad to receive him here  to receive him in that case as a brother and on those conditions too we will both return one day or another and enjoy the fruits of a double marriage for notwithstanding your resistance my father i must still remind you that i have a heart only for louisa god send all together happy of one mind and in one house i care not in what kingdom or in what country  edward corbett  letter cxiii to c corbett esquire i was mounting my horse as your letter and its enclosure which i return to a fathers throbbing bosom arrived i took my foot from the stirrup to read to weep and to rejoice  oh mr corbett you ought never to despair the power who could raise your son almost from amongst the dead and who was indeed dead long since in the imagination of his family may yet preserve to you a daughter  how all the links of this dear connecting chain cling together it is surely the hand of providence which rivets each i here devote myself an humble instrument and hasten to prove the sentiments i prosess be comforted my ever dear corbett be comforted and farewell  robert raymond  letter cxiv to louisa corbett i am an old man in a sad sick chamber without any human being to smoothe the thorny pillow oh louisa louisa i am bereft of all leave for a little while your house and hasten to mine i now fondly approximate every person who has been dear to any part of my family and who has had more claim to our tenderness than the sister of henry yet let me not forget in my sorrow to tell you of one joy that sparkles in the cup of bitterness which is allotted me to drink my son edward lives and he mentions louisa hammond not coldly come and let us talk of him together all ambitious views are worn from my heart renew your gentle hopes and fear not to avow them ah that henry and edward were both safe from the calamities of war and both within the reach of these paternal arms oh you know not the pain in which i write come then if the father of edward  the yet existing edward be estimable  charles corbett  letter cxv to c corbett esquire providence and god what have i read is it not vision is it not delirium is it not the vapor of the soul for ever painting its idol image edward alive oh the poor emma the generous henry the godlike edward you have transported me i know not what i write ease me satisfy me i cannot bear it i am in heaven i am distracted  louisa hammond  letter cxvi to louisa hammond what would i not give to recall the heedless thing i have committed to the post a servant has been to the office to recall it but it is gone in the hurry of my heart i have abruptly told what should have been opened by the gentlest gradations but if you are greatly afflicted it will i trust be of a joyful nature and produce no mischief  charles corbett  letter cxvii to louisa corbett i am commissioned by a friend on whose veracity i can depend to impart a piece of news to my louisa which is delightful as unexpected it is foreign news and america has some sort of connection with it but i cannot be more explicit till i know what present health you are in possession of since the least alarms are not to be hazarded in a state like yours  tell me that you are very stout and you shall hear more  i am sorry my business detains me so long from you it is nearly finished and then i shall be wholly at your service  for emma what can i say but that she is a glorious girl  caroline arnold  letter cxviii to c corbett esquire it is every way confirmed the pleasure is too mighty  my very brain turns with transport yes i will fly to your chamber  i will fly to my father oh prepare prepare to receive another daughter for i am  i am  how shall i speak it  i am no more the widow but the wife of edward  and we have a son i will bring him under my arm i cannot explain  i am too happy should i not be happy my husband lives and his father at length acknowledges  louisa corbett  letter cxix to louisa corbett oh my child my child my arms are open  let them embrace and own you without delay the coach shall be at your door early in the morning and convey you to  a parent in  charles corbett  letter cxx to c corbett esquire i write sitting on the side of louisas bed she cannot have the pleasure to attend you at present being suddenly taken ill do not therefore think of sending your coach till you hear further from  caroline arnold  letter cxxi to c corbett esquire i trouble not my dear father with relating the dangers of the sea the tempests which have deformed its bosom nor the various inconveniences i have experienced since i lost sight of every object i had been accustomed to behold my soul has been too intently occupied with what i have left and with what i am in search of to afford any sensations of common fear or common curiosity i cast the eye of steady attachment over this undulating world and imagine myself guarded from all the ordinary dangers of the ocean by the protecting power who proportions my spirits to the toils they undergo  i escape suspicion from the crew i write without kowing the time i may be able to send the unsteady motion of the vessel distorts the characters of my pen so do not attribute to distress of heart what is the effect of mere situation adieu oh adieu of every letter i will send duplicates that no chance may be lost to ease your suspense  emma  letter cxxii to c corbett esquire accident favors me i trace the footsteps of emma i am now in the house from which she lately departed on my arrival here i overheard some sailors upon the quay reading aloud one of your advertisements after which two of them swore it must mean the fair looking boy who lodged a few nights ago at the ship and sailed in the henry lettre of marque i caught at this and am so far rewarded in my enquiry farewell the opportuity of following your child presents itself adieu  robert raymond  letter cxxiii to c corbett esquire oh mr corbett the abrupt joy produced by your late intelligence has counteracted the tender designs of edward and thrown his poor louisa into a condition which makes me tremble the settled calm of her mind has long been overthrown and i who have been her almost constant companion can assure you that when she has thought herself the most tranquil she has been nearest that state which of all others in this sorrowteeming world is the most afecting indeed sir you should have been less precipitate  yet you meant kindly you acknowledge her for a daughter it is impossible to tell you in what a style of enthusiastic gratitude she speaks of this all will be well and yet  soft she wakes oh what a look how wild how fearful i must leave off writing  caroline arnold  letter cxxiv to mrs arnold a curse attends all i do and all i say oh that i could find the wretch who still cherishes the deathful spirit of this exterminating war i would rush upon him and seize him as the betrayer of both the bleeding countries which he has sacrificed to the lust of dominion and the avarice of power alas the misfortunes which he has brought upon the state are contemptible in the comparison with that anguish that horror that desolation which rends away the softening ties of private life  which tears the heart strings of family and friend  man of blood come forward  if thou art bold enough stand forth  meet the swollen eye of a father whose house thou have despoiled of all his little treasure  oh mrs arnold this rage is vain my soul is compounded of ten thousand violences each retrogade each inconsistent i am execrating myself for have i not myself pushed on the terrors i deplore i have fool dotard villain  hah letters are brought the knock of the post goes through my heart away vile flannels the wellknown characters carry off all bodily sensation as i behold them i have them before me    oh horror horror oh my child my emma  read pity me  ah no read and detest me  charles corbett  letter cxxv to c corbett esquire the enclosure from emma  america bound by promise by obligation and by the laws of nature to send you faithful accounts of myself i dare no longer conceal the incidents which have happened to the veriest wretch that ever   my dear dear parent turn all your anger into compassion if all that remains of emma be yet dear or yet alive in your remembrance  our vessel has been attacked has fought and is taken oh the mountains of men murdered by men that lately lay strewed about me my blood runs cold some of it indeed is shed for i am wounded but it is slightly and in no important part ah that it were a deathswound rather than    i am watched pens and paper are objects of suspicion  ah what have they to fear emma is no intriguing captive  she is a prisoner and a mourner who bows to her fate she resists not  i must hide this poor remnant of narrative in my bosom  fresh prisoners are brought  they are entering what crowds what   oh my god is it possible  do not my eyes   second enclosure from sir robert raymond corbett the seal of providence is surely upon my enterprise oh happy chance i have at once saved and rescued your daughter it pleased god to carry me into the same place of confinement where i found her mingled with the multitude of our unhappy countrymen a violent shriek upon my entrance betrayed her to me her mans apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes so familiar with her voice and her features she fainted in my arms  the prisoners were too much involved in the sullen gloom of their own melancholy to regard the distress of another the paper which i enclose spotted as you see with drops of blood from her own lovely arm fell from her bosom by the time she recovered one of the officers who had guarded us approached  she looked at him a moment it being the first time she had seen him since he came in and then sunk without any appearance of life upon the floor she lay as a corpse  oh merciful heaven  oh god great and gracious god cried the officer it is  it is  it must be emma  it must be my sister  presently emma and edward corbett for it was your son my friend were both embracing upon their knees  it was no time to explain she was moved out of the prison i was permitted to attend edward corbett in his own arms conveyed her to an apartment he obtained leave of absence from the farther duties of the day he was the nurse of your poor emma oh mr corbett i was not idle  washington happened to be quartered at the same town preparing the maneuvers of a new attack he is easy of access and being at liberty on a parole of honor i gained an interview  ah can you not guess its motive what could it be but the freedom of the captive emma the general heard the story of her love as i related it i concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own former folly i brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it the soldiers cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear he wept  sacred said he be the rights of hospitality i am not at war with the affections ever privileged be their emotions i feel them all the beauteous prisoner is at liberty sir robert to go where she pleases i shall appoint persons to attend her who may prevent all interruption and insult but you methinks sir robert should continue to follow her fortunes as a friend you are both free  i flew to edward corbett with the tidings emma had by this time acquainted him with her situation  at what a moment did i enter the room your son was pronuncing or rather attempting to pronounce the names of wife and parent of louisa and his little edward and have i then these blessings cried he and is my father yet in ignorance what claims what doublytender claims louisa corbett has upon him he then pressed his sister in his arms and they wept together  surprises came too fast upon the hapless youth he knew not that henry was under arms he did not know that he was an enemy yet he dropped for awhile the fierceness of the soldier and acted as a man  as the child of nature  as the husband of louisa and the brother of emma then go my sister said he your career is too glorious to be checked in contemplating your conduct i rise above all the prejudices of party alas my sister i know too well the sorrows of love and separation not to respect them you find me here the foe of henry but it is not now the day of battle and were he at this moment here should i not expand these arms to receive the lover of emma go then but we are on the eve of a desperate undertaking  our army moves tomorrow i tremble for thee perhaps we may never meet more  perhaps  ah retire retire my best loved sister ere the idea of losing you for ever should tempt me to break my promise and    this fraternal kiss this affectionate embrace and farewell give me not leisure to reflect let me not have opportunity to consider the consequences of thus  ah take her from me sir robert she is gaining on my affections and i shall not be able   here he stopped mr corbett emma beheld the gathering storm of tenderness coming on and exerting a resolution more than human as fearing she should be prevented from pursing the great object of her adventure which was even dearer than a brother she caught me by the arm and shortened a scene too poignant to be continued  no sooner were we alone  i am interrupted farewell  in continuation no sooner had we got beyond the reach of those sighs which were breaking from the heart of edward than his lovely sister fell upon her knees pressed my hand to her bosom and spoke thus  oh generous deliverer i devote to thee the first moment that the confusions of crouding incidents allow to pour sorth the tribute of my gratitude i ask not the means by which heaven directed you to me but i feel the motive of your voyage so pathetically so perfectly so  ah sir robert wherefore do you heap on me this agonizing goodness wherefore did you pursue the footsteps of one whose preoccupied heart and plighted hand make it impossible to reward your kindness or your generosity not even a beloved brother whom i thought breathed no more not even edward longlost and newly found could prevail with me to forego the purpose of my pilgrimage no by this affecting effusion of tears which are now bathing your hand i swear  but it is unnecessary behold a woman firmly resolved sir robert oh why are you then  indeed it is vain indeed it is go then i conjure you return to my dear my drooping father  assure him that his emma is in no danger  tell him that his darling son is found alas how i forget myself of this you say he is already informed but at all events return it is to no end that you follow me how can you expect   i expect it not miss corbett said i attempting to raise her up  here will i remain cried she till you pledge to me your honor that you will here close the debts which it will never be in my power to discharge it is no place or time for argument sir robert you are even now preventing me from the great business of my life i beseech you to leave me i am not ignorant of your passion but i thought your prudence in never revealing it to me by your own mouth  in short sir i must insist on   i saw her mistake my dear corbett and briefly explained it how shall i describe to you the emanation the burst of tender gratitude when she found  but indeed i do not deserve half she said or half she thought  alas it is passion still that drives meon  not indeed the passion which partakes of one gross image or of one vehement appetite pitied be the wretch who persecutes an engaged heart yet i love to see to serve to oblige her  i love to   again interrupted no wonder i am writing amidst scenes of constant disturbance the seats and theaters of war are before me the guards of a generous enemy in compassion to private woe are in front and in rear it is all deathful preparation there is no prospect of peace on every brow is defiance in every eye flashes the bloody determination we hear the shrieks of widows and daughters and fatherless children as we move forward families are busied in burying their dead rescued from the corruption of promiscuous carnage hearses and funerals pass thick along the bell of death tolls out in every street but emma is still fixed in her design her eyes melt her countenance is pale but her heart pants with love and her soul is undaunted adieu  in continuation oh sacred force of sovereign tenderness emma has tidings of her henry our enquiries have at length terminated in success he is now with his regiment off johnstown thither we are bending our course with the utmost expedition i send you not the minutiae of intervening adventures they yield to enterprises of greater moment we are within one days journey of the place  by heavens corbett the roses are suddenly thrown over the cheek of your child and the pale of fatigue and sickess and loss of blood which has not been inconsiderable all give way to the joyful expectation of seeing her henry  surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our disappointments to amiable account to conquer affection is not i feel always possible but to direct it from one worthy path into another when the former is unfit or unjust is assuredly in our power henry himself cannot adore emma more sincerely than myself my whole heart is hers often it trembles often it bleeds but the choice either to be the object of esteem or the object of aversion is before me oh i would not forfeit the partial sentiment which my conduct has lodged in the breast of emma for any other earthly enjoyment she owns me for her friend her first of friends she talks to me without reserve  she looks at me sometimes till the hearts soft tear is in her eye ah that tear it is more worth than the possession of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold grandeur or importunity extorted into their arms i feel it stream over my senses blessed sympathy pure effusion generous glorious emma  i am penciling these informations of our route sometimes in the vehicle and sometimes in a room  emma has this moment desired the driver to stop the door of the chaise is open she jumps out saying to me in a whisper that a lucky thought strikes her  i will follow her  in continuation god of all goodness did thou ever create another emma  in passing along she took note of some bushes which were covered thickly with a duncoloured berry that clustered in the hedgerows i assisted her in gathering these without daring to ask for information as to causes she has an air of entreaty which cuts short all curiosity about motive and leaves us no other solicitude than that of gratifying her by implicit obedience  i knew not the design of emma in picking the berries till the evening and then she explained to me their use  now for an experiment dear sir robert said she taking up the bundle and going into her chamber at a publickhouse where we baited at twilight  in about an hour she reentered  she reentered corbett but oh how different from that emma who had so recently retired you know the clear and lucid white that mixes with the eloquent bloom in her countenance  you know that rich tint of tenderness and ardour of pathetic softness and graceful passion which forms her complexion imagine my astonishment at beholding these discolored in the darkest shade of that peculiar disguise which the juice of the berries we had collected cast over the skin the stain was deep strong and apparently fixed it resembled almost exactly the hue of some of the savages whom we had observed to be wounded in a town through which we passed  it was certainly inspiration said emma rejoicing at the alteration as she surveyed it in the glass ah how preferable this precious dye continued she to the fairest complexion in the world i shall assist henry i shall touch his dear hand and attend him in every danger without distressing him by surprise or disarming him by softness oh my good sir robert romantic as may seem the steps i have taken be assured that i proceed with the utmost caution i do not even now design to interfere with the horrid virtues of henrys profession i will not dare to place myself betwixt him and his duty i will share his dangers but cannot consent any longer to bear about a wretched being without at least attempting to render it serviceable to my friend your generosity well fits you to receive these apologies if indeed any apologies should be necessary for the conduct of emma on this trying occasion  i could not reply mr corbett even her avowals of the affection that she bears to henry become new sources of my tenderness and admiration but we are setting off again  the next stage brings us to  adieu in continuation oh corbett corbett who shall anicipate a moments joy a moments satisfaction by what an accident was my last sentence interrupted  your son  your poor son  your edward your dear your darling edward is now indeed   bear up my hapless friend against the storm to learn to suffer is the science of humanity each has his throes of heart war which level millions with the dust has at length   but oh the generous youth in what a cause he fell  unable to support our departure he obtained i furlow and followed us the human general permitted him to seek his sister and either guide her to the arm of henry or persuade her to return he promised to return in three days alas he will return no more a party of the english were burning a village after a sudden attack edward drew his unavailing sword to defend himself and the inhabitants who were flying different ways in terror and despair  and there my friend it was your son received his wound  his wound of death  the conquerors drove off the cattle loaded themselves with the spoils of conquest then suffered the peasants to escape and returned to the troops from whence they had been detached  edward bled fast but having traced our route he gave directions to the two soldiers who accompanied him and pressed onward he was resolved once more he said to behold his sister the men who were indeed of those under his command obeyed his orders supported him on each side as he sat in the chaise till poor young man    you know the rest he sunk upon one of their shoulders and with his dying breath insisted on their taking his corpse to emma of whom he had received tidings by the guide who had last left us and whom he met on his return  the poor fellows came on disconsolate with their dead master they reached the town where we stopped and were passing the window of our inn when we heard a cry of the armies are engaged the armies are engaged  the postilion got from his horse the two soldiers who had taken the precaution to alter their dress as americans leaped from the carriage and joined the multitude that thronged the streets  the body of edward was deferred emma who had then just finished her remarks on her disguise seeing a man lie motionless approached the chaise door and there she beheld   oh mr corbett what accumulated miseries is it fated for this virtuous woman to undergo  it is i then that have caused thy death thou beloved youth said she no language can describe her agonies but they were attended to by none but myself for the whole town was in consternation at the news of the engagement every house was emptied the two armies had marched all night and distributed their forces we heard of the largest parties being engaged off johnstown and in that place was quartered the regiment of henry what was to be done edward lay dead before us emma was folding his claycold body in her arms she seemed to be lost in a stupor of irremediable grief she forgot for awhile her henry the alarm spread every moment more wide  horror exhibited itself in every possible form to continue in such a situation was madness to leave the breathless remains of edward  oh shocking thought  oh mr corbett the exigencies of war and the terrors of a town under such a panic are not to be described old men were moving their decrepid limbs from door to door in despair of escape and mothers with their children went wailing by us  with pious haste these hands assisted by my heart which is devoted to every connection of emma prepared an hasty grave for the relics of your son  emma touched at the ceremony burst into a flood of tears and exerting herself beyond what is reported of her sex joined in the last sad offices of love  we are just come from the sacred spot where edward is deposited  emma recovers  she has been several times upon her knees during my marking these circumstances of our distress let us go on sir robert she says or rather oh generous man remain you here and let me proceed my duty to henry yet remains   it was in vain to expostulate she saw the danger but felt no emotions of dismay all feminine and gentle as she is she rose above the spirit of humanity  i insisted on the privilege of attending she pressed my hand within hers and we set out for the scene of action  it was altogether an impulse of most solemn enthusiasm emma was resolved and i am the friend of emma  yet the tearful looks which she cast toward edwards grave pierced me to the heart one hallowed kiss more imprinted upon that earth sir robert and i will delay no longer pity a sister  i stood at some distance and saw the lovely one depart o what minutes were these she came forward as if she had made up her mind and then while the resulution seemed nearly formed nature relapsed again into a sisters tenderness and yet once more she embraced the earth  at last summoning her utmost strength she exclaimed the will of god be done and then in weeping submission joined me  in continuation surely emma corbett is an angel and not a mortal woman i have had near thirty hours severe sickness a fever as violent as sudden seized me it could not have happened at a crisis more cruel for we are in the very midst of personal dangers yet nothing could tempt emma to leave me one moment she has nursed me as i were her child she administered the cordials with her own dear hand never was parent half so tender such softness of gratitude  such overpowering attention oh bless her bless her i am now able to pass on and to pursue the footsteps of my beloved associate  adieu adieu in continuation oh heavens i tremble to tell you how near we are to the field of battle  we can hear guns firing in the neighboring woods the english are skirmishing with the rebels in twenty different parts of these environs  in continuatiion yes corbett henry is amongst them he is spoken of by these poor trembling peasants and their masters as the most gallant officer in the army of the british general no person ventures now to no to bed it i altogether a scene of bloodshed havoc and horror the feeble emma droops under her fatigue  i write as moments permit resolved every way to show my affection to your dear family as far as it be possible though heaven only can tell whether this packet will ever    oh dreadful extremity some wounded men are passing by us in a wagon emma rushes forward to enquire of the driver if mr hammond yet lives   he has been fighting since daybreak such the reply  a young woman is at this moment following the corpse of her husband it is indeed too much emma is bowed to the earth oh if she dies  in continuation better tidings the rebels are routed we have traversed the environs but in vain the english are said to be on their return to johnstown emma breathes in expectation oh for strength a little longer and all will be well sir robert says she   in continuation the dreadful news is arrived  oh mr corbett the blow is struck the life of your poor emma must soon close for henry hammond is  how shall i speak it  henry hammond is dead  in continuation the men who have escaped the slaughter are returned and confirm the news emma  the agonized emma  is at the point of    i cannot speak i cannot write i shall not survive her  adieu ps perhaps this is the last account either of us may be able to transmi an officer whom i have just met is appointed to go off with dispatches to england the opportunity must not be lost oh corbett if you never hear more receive the last prayers of one whose life is valuable only as it can promote the happiness of emma that being now for ever obstructed for ever closed what is there in this world that can render tolerable the existence of such a wretch as  robert ramond   n b i have ventured to whisper it very softly to emma that i am about to seal the packet which my trembling hand has written as it could snatch the flying minute  to my father said she oh god oh god tell  tell him   here she folded her arms looked up to heaven tried to articulate more and sunk upon the bed  unfortunate corbett this fatal war has reduced all the honors and blessings of your house to the dust alas how many thousand fathers beside has it not wounded beyond the reach of this worlds remedies  i have stolen from the chamber of emma to scribble the enclosure in the presence of proper witnesses by whom it is attested as we are dying in virtue do thou oh venerable man still try to live in peace and await the stroke which shall be commissioned from above in gods good time to summon you to us  one more look at emma that i may send you the latet intelligence  she breathes  the silver chord is not quite broken yet the cold cold dews descend so fast   no  i have after the pause of another hour visited her again  in her pulse there is yet promise in her eye there is yet hope poor corbett let it comfort you  let it reconcile you to life  a third time i have looked in upon her the officer who is going to the head quarters with the news of the various fortunes that have attended the detached parties in this part of the country has in great humanity waited i told him that a fathers happiness or despair was concerned in his obliging me his last minute is come at that minute your cherub child appears to me  for i dare not deceive you  from another hand it will come with a more crushing weight    now now  even now my friend you are i fear within a few seconds of being childless  if her fever continues to rage another hour as it rages at this crisis no earthly power can delay her passage to heaven at this we ought not to grieve perhaps but humanity shaken to her center cannot   oh my god i heard a shriek    i dare not stay another moment oh farewell  robert raymond    letter cxxvi to c corbett esquire from henry hammond  that paragon of her sex your daughter that man too soaring above the flight of humanity who attended her as the companion of all her perils all her pangs the writer of this letter or more properly speaking the person by whom this letter is dictated is at a loss by what means or in what language to convey to you the wonders which yet he is most anxious to impart  by gentle degrees  oh mr corbett let me open upon you the blessings which by the contrivance of providence have been brought about summon your heart to bear the best the dearest news which it is in the nature of human things for you to hear o let the agony of that information which sir robert raymonds letter has doubtless produced be in great measure done away by the happier tidings that will salute you in this  the handwriting of the person now dictating would too much discompose you he makes use therefore of an amanuensis to prepare the way to circumstances of uncommon joy and to give them to you in the security of more progressive explanation  the leading step to every other felicity you must hear first you who have deply drank of the bitter cup must now try to support without intoxication the taste of sweeter ingredients  from the point of death your emma has recovered the interposing hand of heaven was suddenly extended  ten days after the departure of sir roberts packet she was in a situation to leave her bed to what purpose did she leave it resolution oh how sacred is thy force when animated by the breath of love  if henry be dead said she it is still the duty of emma to pay him the mournful offices which she has paid to edward  she insisted on searching for the corpse of the man who had caused all her misfortunes  the generous sir robert raymond was at that time himself confined by sickness which threatened his life when he was out of danger emma gave him in tenderest charge and set out alone toward those woods where some late skirmishes had passed on her way she had the precaution to use again those berries which tinge the skin to these she added a certain bark that had been mentioned to her in the course of her various enquiries  behold oh mr corbett behold the dear and delicate emma wandering unprotected in the woods of america  behold her bearing over her tender shoulder the mere necessaries of decent covering  behold the most gentle and most female form exposed to all the dangers of a wild and unknown country  picking her food from the hedges  straying she knew not whither  in disguise  in disorder  in despair  incredible were the toils of her research  incredible her fatigue the forests are here you know of great extent the wilds immesurable  after several days traveling during which time she had not encountered any passenger who could give her the least intelligence she sat herself down as usual about the noon and wept over her misfortunes  scarce had she rested a moment ere the clamor of human voices shouting at a small distance caught her attention she pressed hastily forward through the foliage and observed at a little aperture in the forest a party of soldiers engaging with a tribe of indians but while she was eagerly examining the persons of the former the latter were put to flight and retreated with the utmost prercipitation the soldiers pursued and both were out of sight ere emma had time to approach nearer to them  she saw enough however to convince her that the regimentals were british and the uniform of the officers such as belonged to the regiment of henry you will guess her despair when she did not perceive henry amongst them  the bodies of several english soldiers were seen in different parts of the forest but the corpse of hammond could by no diligence be found  still indefatigable she went on though by this time reduced almost to the last exigencies of nature and every thing subdued but tender resolution and the love which inspired it  at length providence relented to her wishes and directed her steps to a broad common pathway across which was extended a human figure lying as dead with an arrow sticking in his bosom you already perceive that it was no other than henry himself this you may perceive but no tongue can give you the faintest idea of that unparalleled heroism and fidelity which now inspired the soul of emma she found the body yet warm the pulse slowly moving and the heart languidly beating with life she extracted the arrow and sucked the wound  she had heard of the indians using shafts whose points were envenomed and rightly concluding this to be one of them applied to it her lovely lips without hesitation  this additional danger was an additional motive to the deed oh mr corbett whatan angel is emma  signs of existence increased with scarce a covering from the sky the affectionate emma sheltered her unfortunate charge for many days ere his senses returned she thickened her disguise by all the arts in her power oh can any thing less eloquent than the great author of nature describe to you the transport of this wondrous creature when she first beheld the longclosed eye of henry open on the light  and open on herself  think mr corbett how difficult concealment must have been at this extatic moment then consider what presence of mind was necessary to repress the dear and dangerous effusion the silver tones of the softest voice in the world were so artfully changed as to correspond with the rest of her appearance she fed him with what the fortune of an hours hunting amongst the fruits of the forest afforded he could not move no soldiers returned men drop in a skirmish and are sought for no more no house was near no hut and she dared not stray too far from the place where he lay lest she should lose sight of the spot but now henry felt the puncture of a want which even emma could not accommodate fruits and vegetables collected by chance as they grew obvious and within the beat of emmas journeyings were too unsubstantial it seemed as if famine would complete what poison had begun for lack of proper nutriment after fatigues so imminent he was reduced to an extreme of languor even worse than that of emma whom tenderness seemed to have rendered superior to every thing that could befall herself  in these moments it was that henry yielded to despair  in these moments his heart melted with gratitude to his protector   oh generous unknown said he feebly whosoever thou art receive the dying acknowledgements of the man whom thou have endeavored to rescue from an untimely death had those kind endeavors succeeded what thanks should thou receive from one of the best  the dearest  but it may not be  i am nearly exhausted  perhaps ere yet another hour moves by  lest that should be the case let me oh let me while yet i have the power to call down heavens choicest blessings on that lovely mourner whose tears are happily streaming at this moment for the expiring henry  ah sir ah worthy youth could thou see her  could thou attest for me these dying sentiments  could thou assure her that with my latest breath  but that is impossible she is a thousand leagues from these fatal shores no matter oh hear me god do thou this night this instant suggest to her what was my last employment  my last aspiration oh emma emma my life my love   here he fell on the bosom of emma and would indeed have died had he known it was emma that supported him  she pressed his hand she could not speak to the omnipotent father of mercy she cast the imploring eye  let not the human heart give up its confidence in heaven it is never too late to trust  a team now past within sight of this disconsolate pair they were laden with provisions and apparel drawn in sledges and small wagons and were on their way to three detachments of soldiers who had applied to the general for these accommodations that were stationed on the north side of the forest amongst this groupe were also some cattle of which some were cows it is unnecessary to say what use the unwearied emma made of these her winning address and the moving simplicity of her grief joined to the wretched situation of an english officer who appeared to be almost at the point of death gained so entirely upon the soldiers and people who attended the sledges and wagons that they adminstered whatever could promote the wish of emma and even furnished her with a sledge a mule and a guide to carry captain hammond to johnstown  thus providentially saved from death a second time i shall not trouble you with other difficulties in the passage or in the progress of henrys recovery though the least of these were enough to immortalize emma corbett bett but i shall convey your imagination to johnstown where henry and his protecor at last arrived and found sir robert raymond recovered from his fever and just about to set out again in pursuit of emma  to her assiduous cares were now superadded those of this excellent man and henry became in a short time the nurseling of both he could walk converse and his wound was healing emmas dear perilous experiment was guarded  the prospect clear on every side one afternoon sir robert gradually prepared henry for the softest surprise that could touch the heart of a lover he discovered himself to be the friend of mr corbett  he assured henry that he saw emma in good health a little before he left england  he asserted in the strongest terms her constancy her attachment her love  and said that such was the force of her affection he should not wonder some day or other to hear that she was arrived in america   yes and in america she is arrived cried she entering at this moment agreeable to the plan concerted she is arrived  she is here  she is now in the presence of her beloved henry  she now offers him the hand of emma for ever  emma was yet in her boys apparel but had washed the stain from her lovely countenance and discovered enough to throw henry first upon his knee to the restoring god and then into arms of this tenderest of women  you will not expect i should tell you what either felt at that moment you will not expect i should describe the series of delicious sorrow and gratulations which followed while all the enterprises of emma were relating to henry he found himself the most blessed most honored and most beloved of men he found emma all that language cannot express he found    in short it was a false rumor you see that reached emma at johnstown respecting the death of henry he was reserved for emma to discover and to restore  he is discovered he is restored  emma is now before him  emma the most generous most    oh mr corbett henry is the happiest of mankind he now tells you that he is  he dictates these explanatory sheets  they flow from his grateful heart  the tenderest mercies of providence have been upon him they are to be seen  they may be felt you will no longer refuse to give him the hand of emma ah that he were worthy of her disclose he beseeches you these tender circumstances to louisa his sister oh he can hold no longer he is too too happy he takes the pen from the amanuensis and  no it is not necessary to sign the letter the writer is now known  adieu letter cxxvii to c corbett esquire the blessings of providence are at length manifest since the packet from henry must ere this be come to hand it is not easy to tell you how totally i have in them annihilated myself for many days past henry recovers apace the attentions of emma indeed so pointed and so pure might almost raise him from the dead yet i almost envy her the share she has had in this discovery and all its happy consequences i can scarce forgive my illness for seizing me at such a time it is emma alone who has been the savior of henry it is henry only who can merit such salvation you can image to yourself nothing so tender as his gratitude so warm as his affections or so perfect as his delicacy from his somewhat military style of address i expected not this and am equally surprised and delighted yes my dear old companion you have yet a daughter and will in a few days boast also   oh my friend how infinitely i fall beneath the standard of my ambition how incorrect is human virtue how frail is human fortitude the prospect of henrys becoming your son does not charm this rebel heart half so sincerely as it ought to do and yet heaven is witness that i am doing every thing to advance his health and his happiness  selfinterested perhaps still i dote on promoting the felicity of emma by any means i am proud to please her i consider the youth of henry and wish it the joys it is formed to taste i reflect on my own age and think that i am too silly to be pardoned i am entirely convinced of my folly and yet hug it to my heart ah mr corbett what is there in that subtle and active principle which we thus feed in our bosoms and which turns serpentlike against the nourisher it stings and we are not angry it tortures and we do not cannot command it to depart from us something like the healing balm flows into the wound and recompenses us for all we suffer the misery which is the consequence of a tenderness like mine is compounded of such sweet ingredients that it is not in the nature of the tender heart to wish it were removed and yet my friend it is most intense i have found the vanity of attempting to argue myself into neutrality it is virtue and beauty that have attracted  that have bound me ere a soul like mine can free itself from such captivity the enchanting powers of its object must change its beauty become deformity and its virtue vice it is out of the question the great point of moral propriety is in every mans power and consequently in mine the human heart loves as it lists  it sees its bias and trembles toward it but society religion and the laws are all to be respected and he who presumes to overleap these renders himself contemptible adieu  robert raymond  letter cxxviii to the same emma in all the graces of the female dress appears more lovely from the late concealment of her charms she has resumed her former self  oh corbett what a woman  happy happy henry what years of bliss    my friend i am not well  i am not as i ought to be  i cannot write  farewell farewell robert raymond  letter cxxix to henry harmond esquire absence from home must have thrown your pecuniary affairs into disorder at any rate the war must have rendered your remittances irregular as a soldier and a single man you might dispense with these obstacles as a connected man about to take on him the sweet charge of providing for a virtuous woman you feel how much the case is altered it is by mere chance i have found out that you are waiting a supply from england on the present occasion that you should want cash is most natural that you should wait for it is most cruel luckily i have brought with me enough to accommodate us both  the enclosed may answer an immediate purpose you say you are my friend show yourself such by using what i offer till your return to england when you will please to repay me the amount i am not you see involving you in an obligation but drawing you into a debt the only interest i shall desire is that my name may not be mentioned to emma in this business these circumstances between us men are nothing  they are things of course  women you know look through a medium so peculiar and are indeed whether married or single so delicately circumstanced that a man of honor trembles to offer what they tremble to accept i know you want money and so dont be foolish  adieu robert raymond  letter cxxx to c corbett esquire henry grows importunate he urges me to assure emma by virtue of my medical knowledge that his health is established he affects unusual mirth and vivacity to prove this he is become intimate with the chaplain of the regiment who is engaged to perform the    by heavens corbett i cannot bring myself either to forget these things or to think of them without misery inconsistent i shall do all right ultimately but opposite sensations are at war within me i walk in the proper path but i am too susceptible of the thorns which wound me  farewell robert raymond  letter cxxxi to the same tomorrow oh corbett is to be the day  henry presses me to attend he knows not i have any reason for these heartfelt objections emma looks unutterable sympathy she seems laboring for an apology she pities me her tears attest it henry beholds them descend and kisses them away with a trembling lip what give her to another  be accessory to the last circumstance of my despair oh most agonizing  most impossible  yet henry entreats  he appeals to me in the name of parent savior    what shall i do i wish them happy happy even together  but to be present at the ceremony  to forward the stroke that cuts off every hope for ever nature recoils at the task and i am too much the subject of her authority to go through it  adieu robert raymond  letter cxxxii to sir robert raymond oh my friend receive the tribute of my sympathy generous man what can i do to soften the woes of which i am unhappily the cause invent i beseech you some reason to absent yourself on the morrow call to your aid some pious disguise to save yourself and me ten thousand wounds your presence will wholly destroy the bliss of the day  even of that day which gives to me the hand of henry indeed it will i see your emotions i see your conflicts they escape your souls most amiable effort they break through your bosom i see them in your tears i feel them in your sighs for my sake  for your own  for heavens  do not continue longer much longer under our roof i esteem you so truly that i cannot bear the constraint which will soon be imposed your virtues have placed you in the second place of my affections  the second place is friendship and that is yours while i can distinguish  while i can feel one worthy sensation but oh consider that the first place is love and that is henrys  henry my almost husband  he presses he importunes he insists in all the emphasis of tender controulment that tomorrow may be the day he almost chides me for coldness of sentiment toward him   alas my dear friend it is your sorrows painted in your countenance and in your late conversation when we have been together which produces this grateful reluctance  i owe you  ah what do i not owe you i would do much  i would do every thing that is possible to serve you  the billet you sent me this morning cuts me deeply you there hint your design to leave philadelphia   i perceive the motive nay you disdain disguise and have in part avowed it all but this you say you can support  my dear dear friend  author of many a comfort  soother of many a care  what would i give had no accident of life produced in your gentle breast these sentiments for emma  hitherto all has been well  all has been great and glorious you still assure me you can act the only part that remains of that i am not to be told yet your friendship is attended by so much suffering so much piercing sensbility that even at this blessed moment my heart bleeds for you  if you will  oh hard request  if you will gently withdraw yourself for a time only till you have gained composure i will defer  i will frame some fresh excuses to henry for my   pity me sir robert and save us both the pangs of an explanation it will perhaps not be in my power to correspond in this way any more i know your friendship will insist upon my fulfilling to the utmost every duty in life and every engagement should this therefore be the last letter that passes between us i conjure you to believe that of every petition of every fervent prayer that i offer to heaven your health and your happiness will form a part i did not think it possible that any thing could fall out to make me wretched with the immediate prospect of being united to henry and yet such is my genuine esteem for you sir robert that i cannot be perfectly happy while i am conscious of creating misery to one of the noblest of mankind henry enters and i can say no more  emma  letter cxxxiii to sir robert raymond why leave us at this charming crisis oh invaluable friend will you who have brought my treasure safe through so many perils refuse to see it locked for ever securely in the faithful arms to whose embrace you preserved it unkind your servant brings word too that you now lie sick at your apartment yet that you resolve to depart on a tour the instant you can bear to be removed this must not be emma has delaved the nuptials because she was too much harrassed in spirits and now i will myself put them back a little that they may not want the ornament of such a friend as sir robert raymond yes i will defer even the possession of emma till her most generous protector is able to sanctify the union by his presence you keep your chamber it seems i will enter it without delay you shall not deny me admittance you shall not suffer me to depart till you are in a condition to do so too emma insists upon this  adieu ever dear ever valuable sir robert adieu  henry hammond  letter cxxxiv to emma corbett obliviate the billet obliviate the

esquire the greatest trial of mine and perhaps of human life is past for i have just heard that your daughter is the wife of henry and yet i am able to hold the pen is there not a certain decent pride that sustains us after the great and difficult duties are performed something like a preternatural consciousness plays about my heart as i consider this triumph over my own passions it is a sacrifice of self to society it is  oh mr corbett i wish them very happy th  their wedding day a express has just reached the eireme i now enjoy  enjoy did i say alas can you not trace the bleeding heart  can you not trace the piercing tho through   away it shall not be and yet to thee my friend i may safely trust ought that remains of unsubdued infirmity if happily you should detect one tears deep mark

a little time  it is near eleven oclock at night as i write this period  i did not attend the ceremony which was this morning performed  i do not propose returning to philadelphia for some days  it is a dreary uncomfortable night i am here too in a large apartment alone sighs burst from my bosom and tears fall from my eyes without any apparent cause the effect of a thick drisly atmosphere perhaps    of a drizly atmosphere ah no  to the passing feeblenesses of nature we are all liable  happily tomorrows sun may make me nearer what i wish and what i ought to be in that fond hope i will now seek repose  corbett what can be the reason of it at the close of the last sentence i went into my chamber in order to go to bed but i sat myself down in a chair by the side of it and have not attempted to undress though the daylight is beginning to dawn upon me a thousand halfformd images have been teazing me i am about fourteen miles from that philadelphia which now contains the loveliest couple i ever beheld corbett i am extremely weak  and extremely a shamed of myself   fie upon me how can i talk thus you perhaps are mourning the death of a son and the absence of a daughter added to the grief of those disorders which tear your aged frame and render you as wretched  as you are respectable unhappy parent dear friend adieu  of my calamities you shall hear no more i blush and silence sits on this selfish subject for ever  robert raymond  letter cxxxvii to c corbett esquire i received your congratulations i received your blessing and to crown the whole of human happiness i have received

of my poor sister and of your own declining health alarm and wound me hapless louisa dear relict of the generous edward ah that we had you both here nursed by our care and protected under the shelter of our most affectionate embraces sir robert raymond too our second father and our first of friends would rejoice at this yet he keeps aloof from us he used to be enamoured of our society and now the deepest solitudes have seduced him from us in vain i invite in vain i implore he is melancholy he is mournful is there a cause for this ah that i could remove it i have now been six weeks in the possession of emma corbett she is my wife god of heaven how i thrill with gratitude yet oh supreme bestower of every good if it were thy divine pleasure to restore my sister and my friends  if it be consistent with that awful design into whose depths i presume not to pry to extend to these a portion of that felicity thou have given to emma and to me the measure of my bliss will be full indeed i am soothed by the prayer it will be accepted it was offered in the souls most empassioned sincerity oh my father join it  join it fervently it is now in heaven before the throne the mercy seat have faith have hope we shall all be happy  what can i say soft enough to convey to you the remembrances of a daughters duty wait a little for her own language which is the only proper vehicle to convey the emotions of her heart  henry hammond  letter cxxxviii to c corbett esquire i have brought my pulses to be almost as obedient as i wish them reason is not so weak a power as we make her appear her province is perhaps misunderstood my friend it is not tyranny but a mild and genial authority which she should exercise the subjects of her sway are the passions those of the tender kind are with the most difficulty governed  i have applied to this our intellectual sovereign on a different principle i implored her not to inspire me with that indifference which is the usual prayer of the disappointed the object of my love is married to the man of her heart she obtained him at the price of almost unparalleled hazards i saw every hope of possession cut off it was an intolerable agony i bore it till i became almost desperate i indulged the passion even till the indissoluble bonds were tied against me i saw the madness of my pursuit and retired  retired my dear corbett not to meditate revenge against a happy rival but to manage my own wretchedness and to think  a serious appeal from the passions to the judgment is seldom made in vain we miscarry chiefly because we are not serious but only suppose ourselves so  i selected a quiet hour and laid the simple facts before me they were not elaborate the woman of my affection thus i argued is now happily married she is generous enough to pity and respect me for misery that she has very unwillingly occasioned accidents have confirmed what corbett at first betrayed i have too much contributed to her present happiness for her to treat me untenderly and yet my farther intimacy will increase her distress even if it does not spread itself in time to her husband how bitterly does she pay for my former services what hinders her now that she is in the arms of henry from looking upon my passion as insulting and impious those very services do i then presume and persecute her upon these oh indelicacy oh folly  but can i conquer my affection no it is not possible it is not necessary to extinguish bad passions and to regulate good ones are the two great points within the compass of reason to covet any longer the person of emma would be infamous it is an inhibition of law of religion and of god but are the merely sensual passions then at my age so very gross that by no exertion no interest i can subdue them what will be the consequence of my persisting the distress of emma who now should taste only of joy the suspicion of henry whose heart melts in gratitude toward me and my own conscious upbraiding can i sustain these or is an obstinate attachment to the only point which reason refuses me and which after all is hopeless strong enough to support me but what then am i to do does reason bring with her no compensations  no equipoise of rewards for punishments so severe she does and many shall i not rank amongst those the delights of a friendship not less tender though less interested  the secretbreathed prayer for one human being whose happiness is dearer to me than that of any other upon the earth  the generous sigh  the softening tear  the social smile  the selfgratulation  the flush of virtue pleased with herself  the smile of emma  the assent of heaven  oh mr corbett we have glorious faculties had we the resolution to exert them we are afraid to begin the heart trembles at a view of its labor we venture to climb the steep and are dismayed but every difficulty of soul and body diminishes by earnest perseverance however cragged the mountain or slippery its path every effort brings us nearer to the summit the second step is easier than the first the third is smoother than the second it is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude when the motive is so great as to concern the happiness of others and our own duty is included surely we should struggle to ascend i corbett have struggled  i cannot say how much or how long but i can and do tell you in the sincerity of my soul that though i am not nor perhaps shall ever be again a happy man i do not wish either the death of henry or the alienation of his emmas affection i can support the presence of both when softness and wedded love sits fairest upon their features and though many a rising tear warns me that it is time to retire no sentiment of irregular desire invades my heart henry cultivates my friendship with kindest care i do not impute to him his happiness as his fault i recede not from his embrace though i seldom make advances to conversation that relates to emma and yet emma is his perpetual subject and his darling theme her own conduct is such as corresponds with every part of her former life perhaps there never was a more affecting situation than she has to perform whenever i am present it is indeed too much for a nature so gentle and so ingenuous but i will remove the effect by removing the cause humanity should not presume to be perfect i have carried a conquest as far perhaps as it can go i have acquired strength by an examination of weakness let me not sink into captivity by foolhardiness i have done much in attempting more i may lose all the laurels i have won involuntary thoughts will trespass on the firmest mind emma is a tender wife a tender friend heaven continue her so while earth has a feeling to make life desirable but the familiar intercourse of a private family is somewhat too much for me at present i constrain emma whenever i visit her and nature impells my steps toward philadelphia but too often  to appear restrained i beg you will tell my steward to prepare castleberry for my reception i will return to england there is no danger of a reiapse but i am obliged to repeat the rescuing arguments too often a few months absence will complete my work henry and his wife  i wish corbett i could write that word with a steadier hand  are happy i leave them in the arms of each other i    oh corbett corbett i will set off for england without delay  robert raymond  letter cxxxix to sir robert raymond i know your character and will give you another opportunity to to gratify it for i will offer you an occasion to oblige me i have for some time felt myself extremely indisposed not i believe in consequence of agitated spirits or of my late fatigues in nursing the dear henry whom heaven has restored to my solicitude and my affections but from some other cause which feels more internal i have not dared to breathe this matter to henry and indeed the satisfaction which i receive in seeing him well and you  o my generous friend  happy would incline me still to silence were not my pains growing so strong that i cannot any longer conceal them a little however of that kind ministration which your skilful judgment knows so well how to bestow and whose good effects i have already so frequently experienced will i dare say set all right again give me your advice in confidence and without delay blessings attend your gentle heart and noble nature  emma  letter cxl to c corbett esquire my baggage was prepared the wind was fair the war would not have prevented me from setting out for england and yet i am delayed human happiness shifts from point to point of her compass and is never fixed  emma is again indisposed  you must not expect me  in continuation unhappy corbett when will fate cease to persecute your family or to torture your friend i tremble at the symptoms which discover themselves in emma  yet do not despair i may be deceived we have long experienced the healing hand remember this and be still  robert raymond  letter cxli to sir robert raymond oh my wife my wife  the treasure of my existence leave her not sir robert  leave her not a moment long has she concealed her misery from a wretch who is fated by every means to distress her  yes sir robert it is i and only i have murdered her i am the accursed cause come to me i conjure you this moment to what am i reserved is this my happiness these the joys of possessing emma  the great the glorious emma are six months of bliss supreme thus to terminate oh that i had died  that i had remained for ever undiscovered  that i had never never  on my knees i beg your aid your society your consolation quit your solitude reside lodge live here i send by express i have orders to join my regiment again curse on the war i will have no more to do with it come immediately  henry hammond  letter cxlii to c corbett esquire mr corbett had it pleased heaven to turn away this bitter cup or given me a less tender nature or    yet let me not dare to murmur i am perhaps blaming what is best  wretched veteran in sorrow how shall i explain myself to you how conceal what must i foresee be communicated  but oh consider my misery i am upon the spot i am a spectator of the scene  i am behind the awful curtain  emma is poisoned  shall i proceed  henry is in the direst parchings of a fever into which grief tenderness and terror have conspired to throw him  oh that barbed and envenomed shaft  that execrable infection which the lovely lips of the loveliest woman drew from the bosom  the wounded bosom of  her husband  this moment i have opened and read the enclosed   whatever be the event be proud corbett be enthusiastically proud that heaven made you the instrument to produce so much excellence and virtue as shines forth in emma i tremble i adore  the enclosure from emma i send this to your room written in that of my husband if you do not join me in my present purpose his affection will destroy him his fever is increased since you left his chamber but his delirium is less violent he has an interval of sense he has just kissed my cheek he felt it wet and wiped off the tear if i write legibly come directly and tell him that i am out of all danger tell him that the venom is all extracted that the present appearances are only the natural effects of a stubborn contagion passing away that i shall speedily recover if you have any friendship for me induce him to believe this  induce him by your countenance your voice your spirits it may stop the progress of his disorder  it may give it a turn  it may save his precious life i am appealing to sir robert raymond i know the friend whom i address as to myself i shall do very well i feel that i shall i take every thing you prescribe  i obey all the other people order me i will refuse nothing if you will but restore my henry  restore my husband   henry is enough himself to enquire what i am about asks how i find myself  i have undrawn the curtain and assured him of the alteration he is sensible of it he frequently clasped his hands and thanked his god his blessing god  he calls for you  now is the moment stay not an instant longer than you have read this  haste oh haste to emma  i went the poor man is piously deceived tears of bliss are at this instant coursing along his face he took my hand he laid it upon his heart let not emma come too near me said he perhaps my disorder may injure her tell her i bless her but let her not approach my breath any more o sir robert continued he you are now a witness to my joy i feel nothing of my disorder i am quite well bear the tidings to my wife it will assist her recovery it will make her happy  i begged him to be composed  he raved with incoherent joy  emma entered in the height of counterfeited spirits  henry was transported and cried emma shall live  in continuation the fate of emma will be slower than the fate of henry  for henry alas is no more  he yielded his last breath about eleven oclock this night  he died in the arms of emma  emma is this moment on the bed clasping the breathless body  heaven thinks fit to make me a witness and a partaker of these calamities which i relate by events and not with the circumstances that produced them  the facts will torture but the narrative would kill you poor beloved wardespoiled old man  i talk not to you of my feelings  i only know that i would have shortened my own existence many years to have saved the life of the hapless youth whose corpse is stretched under my eye  this may seem unnatural and found untrue i am before the searcher of hearts who looks into this deathful apartment i can firmly appeal to his divine attestation  in continuation i have exhausted all words of praise in speaking of your daughter and yet i cannot conceive a language to do her justice  she was prevailed upon to leave the room of henry soon after midnight upon seeing me near her as she rose she burst into tears and bid me look upon the bed  it is poor henry said she  it is the man i sought  the man i found  the man i saved  the man whom providence lent  but to resume    it is my husband   alas it was my husband  i am the widowed emma  be it so i am not desperate i am humiliated it is very hard i can scarcely bear it he was extremely young you cannot think how i loved him sir robert my heart is ready to break but i will not repine i know my duty indeed i do and i will pursue it you shall see i will my friend  oh corbett grief now wholly overwhelmed her and she fell again upon the bed  other duties press on me said she i must yet get health to sustain them i will compose myself  she was led into another apartment  her step her look her voice her motion are not to be described  emma took leave of henry you may image to yourself something like the parting  in continuation henry is in his grave emma is not outrageous but inconsolable  grief is at her heart disease is preying upon her frame but she does not exalt the murmuring voice against the correcting hand  i believe in god said she to me some time ago my trials are extreme but i shall be unworthy to join henry again if i sink beneath them  i feel that i shall die but wish it to be a distant blow for oh sir robert i have reasons  such reasons  in continuation her reasons yet to live cannot any longer be concealed from you my venerable afflicted  your daughter would live to be the parent of that little one with which henry has left her   she is with child  the poison will not i hope   and yet it is possible that    the case is new  in continuation emma has formed another resolution of which emma is alone capable  thus she spoke   my aged father my distracted louisa my dear henrys sister oh lead me to them my medicines may be taken on the sea in following a virtuous and heavendirected affection i have no idea of peril henry is dead and i have nothing to fear  a friend  a parent lives and i have yet a little to hope oh author of nature endue me with new force new patience sir robert be still yourself and quit not emma  you know my answer  in continuation we are upon our return emma is very commodiously situated she has a cabin to herself all that art could do in medicine has been attempted  it is in vain    corbett she must die  you will lose your daughter   her malady is gradual but sure  i dare not flatter you  in continuation i went a little while ago into the cabin and found your lovely one anticipating all the tender providence of a mother she was employed in those soft cares which the prospect  the very near prospect  of her travail justified   a little white robe or wrapper lay on the table finished before her   she had begun to plait the cap   if these sir robert said she should ever become useful  if i should follow my husband ere i can suckle his child at this faithful bosom do not forget  i conjure you do not  if the little wretch should live  do not forget to tell it that it was a mothers hand which prepared the mantle that first wrapped its tender form tell it that for its dear sake i would have lived had it been possible   then pausing a little the exclaimed  and here is my husbands picture  in that trunk are emmas letters  yonder is the mans apparel in which i sought for my poor henry these legacies of love the pledges of a parents fidelity i bequeath my child happen what may they cannot but be precious will they not be valued think you sir robert  she perceived that my distress was too great  sir robert raymond i glory in your attachment i glory in your friendship had the world contained or could it ever contain any man in the eyes of emma but he who sleeps beneath its surface it is not a question who would have captivated her heart  at what a time was this spoken oh mr corbett the single sensation of that moment was worth a miriad of vulgar lives  in continuation we are landed emma lives  we send this by the post which is just setting out it will reach you some hours before we shall i write to prevent surprises for heavens sake exert yourself to meet your daughter  let me prepare you for her appearance be not too much alarmed at her languor you must not expect to see the bloom in her cheek the luster in her eye nor her proportion of limbs so exactly formed or furnished yet she is truly touching truly lovely i am myself much changed but indeed my friend i shall be to the latest moment of my existence unalterably  yours robert raymond  letter cxliii to frederick berkley esquire the enclosed rough draft of letters will enable you o my friend to trace the vestiges of some unhappy human beings since their departure from london to their return  at present fortune seems to continue our wretchedness by means the most complicate and inventive  two hours ago we arrived at the house of the unfortunate corbett it was with the utmost difficulty his daughter reached town  the first object that struck her was a hearse standing close beside her fathers door in the passage she beheld the undertakers bearing a coffin down stairs the woeworn corbett was supported between two servants to take his last mournful leave of the friend whose remains were about to be deposited he could not move he had not received my letter from portsmouth dispatched three days before it had been misssent the letter did not come to hand till two hours after our arrival he was not prepared to receive us  our chaise drew up still closer emma rushed out  the poor old man  the daughter    we are not provided with a language to express these horrors   almost an hour the child and parent remained speechless  it was surprise and agony at once dumb and dreadful  the hearse waited the coffin was placed in it and shut up  the bell is at this instant tolling for poor louisa the sexton is come to tell the attendants that the clergyman is waiting wretched wife of edward she died distracted the hearse is driving off  what a house is here alas it has long and truly been the house of mourning  corbett and emma are still together in the next room to that in which i write the servants look amazement and dismay  i hear methinks the voice of my aged associate in friendship and in sorrow i am called suddenly and hastily   oh friend oh berkley to what am i reserved a premature labor has been brought on by hurry agitation and fatigue this mornings sun sees emma a mother of a living child  the poison seems not to have been in the least degree communicated to this precious pledge it is a female  alas emma would leap for joy at this circumstance she would forget awhile her woes in viewing the babe whom henry had bequeathed  she would present it with some testimony of maternal transport to her drooping father  but that  even henrys offspring can no longer soothe  for emma corbett is dead  her death instantly succeeded the pangs of the birth it happened at midnight  her frame must have dropped in consequence of the venom which resisted the force and subtilty of all application  soon  too soon  would the fair victim of constancy have sunk to the tomb but these precipitating agonies added to the rest  oh they were too much she fell before them  in the expiring moment she called me to her  it is emmas infant take it said she it is a parting gift  i can no more  my father  my poor father   she dropped upon the pillow from which she twice vainly endeavored to raise her head and lift her eye to the objects about her  then breathed her last  thus lived and thus died the most faithful and beautiful of women  charles corbett stands fixed over the corpse of his daughter  the old man is now bereft of all i am childless sir robert he exclaims  behold what civil war has done for me   berkley i have kissed the claycold lips  i have pressed the claycold hand on that bed  that very bed    but i dare not indulge reflection pierced as i am i would fain preserve a decent sorrow ah that i were in my grave impious wish is there a single point of space in the petty allotment of man in which something important is not to be done  yon aged forlorn one now weeping over his child looks up to me alone for something which resembles comfort during the wretched residue of life  the funeral obsequies of emma are yet to be performed   the widow of edward has left a son   the widow of henry a daughter   i will not die till heavens appointed hour i have much occasion still for life  robert raymond  letter cxliv to the same i am just come from the most agonizing ceremony oh frederick that can possibly pass under the eye of man  may you never feel what otherwise you can never know easy in your fortunes quiet in your situation unconnected in your interests you can happily for you have no conception  at least no perfect one  of that rend in the heart which is made by death when youth innocence and beauty is committed to the dust  when the parent hangs his drooping head over the last sad tenement  when the orphans   whatever i said youth innocence and beauty  and do all these then go down to the earths cold bosom shall none of them ascend the glooms of the soul almost carry sensation into sin they shall all ascend the one shall ensure everlasting existence to the others innocence shall immortalize beauty and youth  i am reasoning with an almost breaking heart berkley while poor old corbett the survivor of his family in all the solemn pathos of grief forgets every pain of body in nursing that which is seated within the romance of youth may teach you to expect that i should execrate  that i should summon to my assistance every infernal power  that i should tax heaven itself with cruelty and take refuge from altercating man amidst the friendly concealment of impenetrable woods this may perhaps answer the purpose of the novellist but it corresponds not with the nature of your friend no berkley it is not in a moment like this that the truly touched and truly tender indulge themselves in outrage the first burst is past that which began with loudness with vehemence and with vociferation settles into the still the solemn and the affecting the temper stormy and headstrong of corbett himself terminates in the eloquence of dumb distress the tears fall fast from me as i write more impetuous periods i have felt so awful and so affecting a crisis never did i experience you who knew not emma and have not a regular though you have a worthy heart cannot know what i have lost the manner of her death  the motive  and the whole tenor of circumstances connected with it throw over every passage of the scene a color so movingly sad that i sit wonderstruck in the room and seem almost in my grave with the world about me i have exerted myself to say thus much at the winding up of this solemn catastrophe lest you my dear barkley or any other person into whose hands these incidents may fall should presume to question the ways of almighty god which are justifiable in every part of this pathetic story erroneous notions of punishment and reward are perhaps the leading steps to irreligion and infidelity the vile herd of novellists have done an essential injury to the cause of virtue by sacrificing to the pleasure of the reader beyond the simplicity of truth difficulty in the beginning of a narrative love in the middle and marriages at the end make up almost invariably the recipe of a modern romance this is called rewarding virtue a bad character or two perhaps drops off and that is called punishing vice false foolish conclusion look into life does not heavens blessed beam shine equally on the just and the unjust are all rewards so mechanically contrived has virtue no joys of her own  joys which generous sorrow only can produce is the sacred struggle of a good man altogether afflictive to pass through a road perplexed and thorny  to travel through a hard and difficult life without tearing the finer principles from the heart does it require no better conduct than moves in the machinery of those contemptible pages where all is given up to lettered art and distorted imagination are there no sweets in the pensive sigh  the pious tear break they from the mourner without offering him any balm has heavenborn constancy no comforts consider the life of emma has death at once virtuous and christian nothing to lift the survivors spirit above every care of vulgar being oh frederick i am touched by a very tender example in lamenting as i now lament say my friend is there no dear and welcome mitigations yes i feel  i feel that there are would i part with this generous grief  ah no what would i take in exchange  the universe should not buy it from me i even anticipate the holy satisfaction when i shall steal from the shout and strife of society to the tomb of a virtuous woman think you i love her less because i no more shall see her has she suffered in my esteem by her ascension into heaven shall she lose as an angel what as a mortal she acquired i love her better the omnipotent placed her in the path of my life to fix and concentrate the best of passions i am not of disposition or age to change again oh that the daughter of emma may live shall i be content with a parents common duty  to cloathe to feed to educate consider barkley whose babe it is  i have hurried down stairs to examine my treasure   it lives it sleeps i have felt its gentle breath on my cheek  god will spare it louisas orphan too is mine corbett too shall live i have moved toward his bedside often since i began to write his face is hid  he will not yet endure existence but the hours of resignation are at hand  i conjure you then berkley to settle your opinions about providence  bring your piety to a point  cultivate your tenderness  love like emma and if you meet with such a disappointment do not transfer your affection but turn it to a generous account the vulgar effect of tender distress is dissipation or despair had i yielded to these a poor old man would have wanted a friend two lovely infants a parent and i the selfapproving bosomray which chears my spirit in this vale of sorrow  circumscribe not therefore the rewards of heaven the writer of a romance would paint me as a wretch without hope who calls down the stroke of fate in pity to his aid attend you to the reality my friend and behold a man who wishes still to live and who thinks himself rewarded  farewell robert raymond  letter cxlv to the same we are removed to castleberry oh it was a gloomy and mournful greeting that i paid it  every tree every book every chair figured before me as the spectre of a buried joy emma enters the bosom and touches at a thousand points  yet even in this woe there is a mixture of sweetness i would not be without it the mad metropolis i am told is just illuminated for success in battlethe house of corbett is an example of the reasons either party have to rejoice on this or on any similar occasion it is not an enemy that has done this great mischief  it is we may truly say our late familiar friend  i enter the metropolis no more a few years only can be mine they shall be engaged in reconciling my poor dear corbett to life on heavens own terms and preparing for infancy an easy cradle  for age a smooth and peaceful pillow berkley congratulate me my children are both well the bounty of the almighty is still upon me  oh friend receive my cordial blessing let your heart be kind your life be pure and   farewell robert raymond  letter cxlvi to the same in the close of our correspondence on this subject receive the tribute of a tender tearful moment  receive an epitaph for emmas marble the little emma will i fondly fancy resemble her cherub mother at least i am hourly shaping her lovely features into imaginary similitude and when affection is looking for a likeness she either finds or forms it but whatever be the exterior of this dear dear legacy oh may her mind take its color from the parent and emma who is in heaven again give luster to earth in the virtues of her child  robert raymond  inscription the author of emma corbett is indebted for this monumental tribute to an elegant and tender friend por the monument of emma ah pass not yet if thou did ever know the tenderest touches of impassioned woe pass not if truth and fortitude and love can stay thy footsteps or thy spirit move pass not if every elegance of soul can charm thy senses or thy steps control pass not if more than roman virtue here with more than female softness claim the tear nor pass if heavenborn sympathy have art to urge the thrilling pulses of thy heart but if nor suffering worth thy soul can move nor the sweet impulse of a generous love if fortitude with glowing beauty joined knows not the power to captivate thy mind if health if joy devoted to the tomb if life laid down to ward a lovers doom if patience perseverance ardour truth blended with every charm of female youth if these and every virtue every grace want power to melt the soul upon thy face then quickly pass  this hallowed spot forbear the feeling heart alone should tarry here the end
