a collection from dyers letters concerning the elections of the present parliament with an appendix relating to some other public matters  london printed and sold by b bragg in avemarylane   0   advertisement whereas her majesty has been graciously pleased on all occasions to express her truly royal and religious concern for promoting the welfare of her subjects and particularly for uniting them in their common interest against the common enemy on the contrary our domestic and most dangerous enemies have been indefatigable in their industry to obstruct these glorious designs of her majesty and her ministers by fomenting our animosities and perpetuating our unhappy divisions  and whether those weekly papers from whence this collection is taken may not be reckoned amongst these mischievous engines that have been set at work for some years past is humbly submitted to the consideration of the persons in authority as a necessary duty and service to he public  a collection of several paragraphs out of mr dyers letters london may  d   0  yesterday my lord keeper sent out writs for a new parliament and the first election will be on monday next at malden in essex where two honest loyal gentlemen called by the whigs tackers will be chosen the rest of the elections will come on very quick and be soon over  may  th our port letters have nothing in them considerable nor have we any public news but what relates to the approaching elections and more particularly from exon we have an account of the honorable reception there of john snell esquire one of the representatives in the late parliament an honest loyal and brave tacker who arrived from london on the  st instant having been met some miles out of town by above  00 horse and some  000 foot composed of the neighboring gentry with the clergy aldermen and principal citizens who conducted him to his own house with the city music playing before him the streets ecchoing with these acclamations god bless the loyal tackers and send the sneakers more honesty and courage  at dartmouth they have that veneration for the service of their worthy representatives fred and not hern esquires that they have christened a ship by the name of tacker  we hear that    strangers are like to be chosen in wiltshire not one of them having a foot of land in that county to the reproach of the electors for not having a greater value for the honest loyal neighboring gentry  may  th we have an account that these elections were made yesterday viz malden in essex will fytche and joh comyns esquires tackers town of hertford charles caesar and rich gulston esquires tackers agmondesham lord cheyne and sir sam garrard bar the last a tacker the other a wellwisher to them so that here is five out of six which is a good beginning and it is believed very few of the     will miss of their elections notwithstanding the senseless clamours of whiggish libellers sir will drake has brought an action against an attorney of exon for calling him tacker and saying he is a friend to france  the b of s labors tooth and nail to oppose these sort of gentlemen declaring from the pulpit that it was the orders of the qn and the d of m to excite the people against the tackers and sent the ensuing circular letters to the inferior clergy of his diocese viz  gentlemen i have been b here    years and never meddled with any elections till now but now the qn seeing which way things are going gave us particular commands to take care and send such persons as will support her and her government i therefore recommend to you sir ed ey and mr ah as fit members i shall take further inspection than you imagine therefore remember etc   what sort of churchmen these are the b recommends is well known  we have an account from cheshire that sir george warburton and mr offley who stand candidates for that county have had a rencounter and are both wounded  may  0th we have an account of a pretty many elections since my last but fortune has favored the wrong side for mr nevile has carried it at abingdon against sir simon harcourt by  0 odd voices at ailsbury simon main esquire against simon harcourt clerk of the crown at wallingford mr kent against mr renda at colchester mr bullock against sir tho cook at wendover sir roger hill against sir richard crawley at rochester mr knatchbull has lost it as has mr randyl at guilford on the other hand mr gape has carried it at st albans notwithstanding a great lady went down thither to oppose him whose endeavors it is hoped will no better succeed at woodstock in favor of brigadier cadoggan an irishman the county city and university of oxford have elected their old tacking members  may   th since my last we have an account of a great many elections some of which have gone well but more ill five honest tackers have lost it in kent and two at haslemere in surry and one in westminster on the other hand the honorable charles north esquire has carried it at banbury the greviles at warwick and for the county of suffolk the earl of dysert and sir rob davers where there has been such a trial of the strength of parties that the like has hardly been known the poll ended on wednesday night when twas found that sir rob davers had      the earl of dysert      sir dudley cullum      sir sam bernardiston      voices so that the election was carried by a great majority if you consider the terrible opposition that was made by the lowchurch men and their friends the phanaticks of all sorts supported by the d of gn the lords corllis and hy but this victory is owing in a great measure to the diligence of the clergy of which  0 went and polled in one body and as many singly being not advertised of the design and to pin the basket sir tho hanmer brought in a body of  00 horse at the sight of which the d withdrew from the window and all was given up and though the great cry of the whigs was and is no tackers yet that is known to be only the word that is given out to the party the true meaning is no church of england man for we find that they have opposed sir simon harcourt and others that had not the honor to be of that number with the same violence and sir will asht in a letter to his friend at warrington tells him plainly that it is past    a clock with the church so that she must come down at these proceedings the inferior clergy are so alarmed in cheshire that they design to appear in a body for sir r motyn and sir g warburton the late representatives for that county and in essex for sir charles barrington and sir r child dr oats is gone to poll at woodstock for brigadier cadoggan of which place he is a burgess  may   th since my last a great many more elections are made which are too long for my purpose to enumerate brigadier cadoggan has carried it at woodstock against sir john waters a very worthy gentleman but dr oats did not go to give his vote as was said he would nor did the solicitor general though he had also a right so to do the lord woodstock son of the earl of portland has carried it at southampton against frid tilney esquire a loyal and worthy gentleman which was done by this trick that gentleman happening to pay his reckoning in that town with about  0 loudores which he had received there the whig party immediately gave out he was a french pensioner which calumny answered their purpose  a great sum of money has been spent at newcastle under line by mr offley and mr lawton the latter brotherinlaw to my lord hallifax to get in burgesses there but sir tho bellot and mr cotton have carried it and the chief reason for their succeeding was the assurances they gave their electors of their firm adhesion to the church in this day of danger  the report we had of a rencounter which happened in cheshire between sir g warburton and mr offley proves not true yesterday commenced the election for the city of london and the four whig candidates were declared to have the majority upon view and are like to carry it upon the poll  may   th we have an account of a great many more elections made since my last and upon the whole a sort of an equilibrium seems to be between the parties near  0 of the tackers are already chosen in essex sir chapter barrington and sir r child have lost it by a great majority though they polld more freeholders than in former elections but the whigs have found a way of granting quit rents of  0 shillings per annum resignable upon the tender of six pence besides the quakers in general throughout the kingdom in this election vote against the church  the poll in london runs still in favor of the four whigs and their election will be declared this evening  may   th yesterday our letters from the several parts of the kingdom brought an account of a great many more elections that are made and particularly for the county of gloucester col colchester and sir john guise have carried it against the honorable john how and sir ralph dutton bar for warwickshire the old representatives sir chapter shuckburgh and sir john mordaunt the last a tacker have carried it being set up by the general consent of the gentry of that county one captain lucy supported by the assistance of three or four gentlemen and the assistance of all the dissenters attempted to have come in but was very much distanced as you will see by their numbers on the poll sir chapter shuckburgh      sir john mordaunt      cap lucy      the bishop of worcester refused the latter his interest upon application to his lordship by reason a fanatic preacher is kept in his family  the welsh elections are not yet made but we may guess how they will be by the loyal health that is amongst them viz  he that owns with his heart and helps with his hand the church that is established by the law of the land conforming for conscience and not on occasion not eluding the law by a knavish evasion not melted through favor nor frozen through fear by the smiles of the court or the frowns of a peer but boldly maintains his religion and right dares die for the one for the other dares fight this is the man and this alone whose health now i drink whose friendship i own nor are the cornish elections yet made by reason by a trick or manage the writ has been delayed sir r vivian has had the misfortune to break his leg however the gentlemen of the county labor to support his interest against mr boscawen  on thursday last came on the much contested election for the university of cambridge the candidates were the honorable arthur annesly esquire late fellow of magdalen college who had     voices and the honorable dixey windsor esquire fellow of trinity college who had   0 opposed by fr godolphin esquire my lord treasurers son who had     voices and sir isaac newton a late made knight who had     notwithstanding there was all the management and delay possible and the heads of the houses against the two first yet twas carried for them to the unspeakable joy of the hopeful and promising part of the university by which we may see that the sense of both universities was for the occasional bill and that they approved of the tacking it by choosing the same members that joined in it  i hear the poll at woodstock will be printed that it may be seen who they were that polld for the brigadier whose grandfather was governor of trim in ireland for the parliament and his grandmother was daughter to the famous sir hardress waller on his fathers side his pedigree was proved by an epitaph that was made last summer by one at the herald office and was never yet upon a tomb  may   d yesterday we had an account of a great many more elections that have been made since my last which for the most part have been in favor of the church interest and particularly sir r middleton bar is elected for the county of denbigh and will robinson esquire for the borough of that name they having rejected mr brereton one of the commissioners of prizes by reason he was not a tacker  mr sacheverel met with terrible opposition from the whig party at nottingham which were supported by the d of n the lords kton and hw however he carried it by a considerable majority and they got him into the chair before eleven at which the whigs looked so simply as though twas past twelve with them the management of this victory was due in a great measure to the neighboring gentry and in a more particular manner to that honorable gentleman sir tho willoughby who has carried diverse other elections which he has been at with equal success as newark retford and leicester and on wednesday the   d is to be the election for the county of nottingham where sir thomas and mr thornihagh are like to carry it without opposition  sir justinian isham and mr cartwright are rechosen for the county of northampton by a majority of  00 freeholders though they were strenuously opposed by my lord mordaunt who it is said spent  000 l and sir andrew st john sir will drake a brave tacker is chosen at honiton with sir walter young whom the electors made promise to be one upon occasion sir john elwill was vastly distanced the two first were met and ushered into town by above  000 gentlemen on horseback all wearing a golden tacker in their hats the same day mr reynell and mr yard two loyal gentlemen carried it at ashburton against sir john elvil and his son  the two loyal sons of the church and tackers nath and fred hern esquires were unanimously rechosen at dartmouth and sir hump mackworth with mr coulson at totnes so that the word tacker which the phanaticks thought to have made a bugbear amongst the freeholders and other electors proves in most places a badge of honor that recommends those gentlemen to them and we see some great men that trimmed or sneaked in the last parliament upon that account are not like to have the honor to sit in the next  may   th yesterday we had an account of a great many more elections made since my last and on saturday last ended that for lancashire the candidates were the honorable mr stanly brother to the lord derby sir roger bradshaigh bar and mr shuttleworth the two first were set up by the papists and presbyterians the third by the church of england and a majority was declared for mr stanley and mr shuttleworth to the great mortification of the whigs who have endeavored by all means to eject the latter the church had so much the better at this election that mr shuttleworth left  00 unpolld and sir r bradshaigh had only   00 sir richard how and mr hyde have carried it for the county of wilts by a great majority  may   th since my last we have received an account of a great many elections and particularly from cornwall where by the interest and endeavors of the new lord lieutenant of that county and of the b of e a great many alterations are made in favor of the party that oppose the occasional bill or for low church but in wiltshire it fared better with those two loyal churchmen that the b opposed for they carried it by a majority of  00 against the occasionalmen or was and the inferior clergy notwithstanding the menacing letter sent them voted for the best churchmen  in kent the lord villars and sir cholmely deering have carried it for that county in opposition to sir r austin and mr colepeper by a considerable majority sir john packington has carried it for worcestershire and the two old tackers for coventry upon the whole the best judgment that can be given is we may have a court parliament but twill not be a whig one  may   th since my last we have had an account of several elections which i leave to the gazette to enumerate only the management of some of them is worth notice particularly for the county of worcester where sir john packington and mr bromley carried it gloriously against mr walsh who was set up by the dissenters sir john packington had a banner carried before him whereon was painted a church falling with this inscription for the queen and church packington twas observable that as they were marching through the foregate street they met the bishops coach in which was a nonconteacher going to poll for cap walsh but the horses at the sight of the church as twas believed turned tail overturned and broke the same and very much bruised the holderforths outwardman and this raised no small admiration that the bishops horses should be afraid of a church  for the county of chester the honorable mr booth and crew offley esquire set up by the whig interest have carried it by a vast majority against sir roger mostyn and sir george warburton the two late representatives for that county although the two latter polld  00 more than at the former election and had all the clergy and the body of the gentry on their side but this conquest was wholly owing to above a thousand defeasable freeholders that party had made against the election which is a new and scandalous practice and if the next parliament do not enquire into it and put a stop to it the whole constitution will be subverted the cry of the whig rabble during this election was down with the church and the bishops and when about  0 of the clergy headed by the dean came to poll they said hell was broke loose and these were the devils black guard they abused the bishop though according to his peaceable temper he did not intermeddle in the election and to complete their outrage broke the windows of the cathedral and another church  yesterday was the election for middlesex the candidates were the two old members opposed by sir john wolstenham and mr barker supported by the whig interest and the latter carried it by a majority of  00 the highest of them polling about   00 which is some hundreds more than ever were polled at any election in this small county and this multiplication of freeholders is wholly owing to the new method  may   st since my last we have an account of some more elections but nothing so very material has happened at them as at that for sussex the high sheriff turner esquire refused to take the poll unless the d of s removed out of the court which he obliged him to do after some high words had passed the high sheriff producing a vote of the house of commons against peers intermedling in elections which however they have done more in the electing this parliament than ever the quakers in buckinghamshire have voted all of them against my lord cheney though he was the person that brought in and procured the bill in their favor about the signing a declaration instead of an oath at brentford several hundreds of them polld against smithson and lake as they have done against the church interest all england over which no doubt will be remembered and placed to their accounts in bar of future favor  june  d we have an account of several tackers more that are chosen since my last of which number are sir edward seymor and mr snell who carried it without opposition at exeter though endeavors were used to have brought in a gentleman that lately lost it at cambridge but that loyal city would not be put upon with the universitys refuse in some copies leavings was first written but that not being thought severe enough was erased yet not so but still to remain legible and the word refuse written above it  june  th the election for knights of the shire for somerset runs thus nath palmer esquire      voices john piggot esquire      george worner esquire      francis lord hawley      the letter of june  th mentions nothing of elections  june  th yesterday we had an account of the election for devonshire which was made on tuesday last where the honorable sir will courtenay bar and robert roll esquire both loyal and stanch churchmen were unanimously reelected to serve for that county so that as the first borough viz malden begun with the election of two brave tackers so the last county ended with the like choice  the election for knights of the shire for northumberland was commenced on thursday the last of may the candidates were sir john delavall bar sir fran blake knight and tho foster esquire jun and though the two first were supported with the interest of the d of st the e of cle and the lord gy in person and all the whigs in the county by promises and threats and the last only by the clergy and true churchmen yet he carried it for one by a great majority as you will see by the poll viz foster     sir john delaval     sir francis blake     besides the first had  00 freeholders more that were ready to have polld but the knights threw up  no doubt but this house of commons the major part of them being churchmen will remember and gratify the quakers for the service they have done them in this election by supporting their marriages by a law and easing them from the payment of small tithes which is that they aim at as appears by the circular letters sent by the heads of them to their friends in the country directing them how to vote  june   th the election for members of parliament is now over and it is found that there are   0 new members chosen that were not in the last house of commons and  0 of the tackers and    left out near a moiety of which did not now stand upon the whole both parties seem pretty well pleased each fancying the majority is on their side  the bristol election of which we had an account but yesterday is gone for the old members mr colestone nephew to a gentleman of that name who had given a charity to that city of  0000 l lost it by     voices those ingrates crying out no almshouseman no highchurch man no jacobite etc  an appendix containing a few of mr dyers scandalous observations and reflections in some of his late letters upon matters of a public concern london june   d monday next being theday for the annual election of sheriffs for london and middlesex the sheriff making party design to put up sir charles thorold and sam stannier esquire they are always for securing that point not knowing what occasion they may have for ignoramuss  june   th sir chapter thorold and sam stannier esquire were elected sheriffs for london and middlesex for the year ensuing there was scarce any body appeared at the common hall but the party that put them up the churchmen finding which way the stream must go are passively obedient  july  th a new book is come out of    d price entitled a memorial of the church of england humbly offered to the consideration of all true lovers of our church and constitution the same is an exeraordinary piece and shows the drift and intrigues of primier mr and others and the languishing state the c is now in  july  0th the messenger of the press is ordered to make a discovery if possible of the author printer and publisher of the book entitled a memorial of the church of england which gives great offense at c but the swarm of libels on the other hand pass with a sort of privilege as the history of the court of poland and others  july   st the manifesto of the church of england that was endeavored to be suppressed is now again sold publicly about the streets the bookseller being resolved to take the benefit of his copy and stand the test of the law and the pretended remarks that are printed with it strengthen and not confute the assertions of the author  july   st we have an account from the assizes at maidstone that the soldier belonging to shereness fort that bastinadoed to death one machleman a whig and trusty pedlar was condemned to die for the same but the major who it is pretended hired him for half a crown was cleared by the jury contrary to the directions of my lord chief justice the same was a mighty partycause  aug  d we have an account from the late assizes at horsham in sussex that the clergy of that county in a full body making upwards of   0 waited on arthur turner esquire the high sheriff and in a solemn manner gave him their thanks for standing up for the interest of the church in the late election and for vindicating the rights of the commons in not permitting a great lord to be present at taking the poll for knights of the shire the grand jury for the county returned the high sheriff the like thanks and were both magnificently treated by him  sept  st the two sheriffs have waited on dr willis with the thanks of the lord mayor and court of aldermen for the sermon he preached before the queen at st pauls on the late thanksgiving day though at the same time i hear that sermon is variously reflected upon and will hardly escape without an answer it containing very hard reflections on the main body of the church of england  a vindication is come out of the memorial of the church of england when at the same time the grand juries of london and middlesex this present sessions have presented the same as a dangerous libel but that is no wonder if we consider the juries and who return them  sept  th the g j of london that presented the memorial were ten of them dissenters and only two of the panel churchmen who refused to sign the said presentment  sept   th an elegy is come out upon the famous achievement of burning the church of englands memorial last sessions at the old baily  sept   d this morning came on the election of a president for bridewellhospital and the two aldermen which had the majority of voices the whole court having been put up seriatim were sir thomas rawlinson and sir john hublon and though the first had    the latter but    yet my lord mayor who presided would not declare the first elected but raised a scruple that all the electors which he called governors were not freemen and therefore he would refer it to the court of aldermen at which innovation they very much complained as well as of some other tricks that were shown them  finis
