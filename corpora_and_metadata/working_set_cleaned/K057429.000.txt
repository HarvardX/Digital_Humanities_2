on illicit love  on illicit love  written among the ruins of godstow nunnery near oxford   pulchra gaudet latona diana sed vetat optari faciem lucretia qualem ipsa habuit  rara est adeo concordia formae atque pudicitiae juvenal by john brand a b of lincoln college oxford    newcastle upon tyne printed by t saint for j wilkie no    st pauls churchyard london j fletcher oxford and w charnley newcastle  mdcclxxv  advertisement godstow is at present a ruin on the margin of the isis at a small distance from oxford it was formerly a house of nuns famous perhaps on no account so much as for having been the burialplace of rosamond daughter of lord clifford the beautiful paramour of henry the second this monarch is said to have built a labyrinth at woodstock to conceal her from his jealous queen who during his absence when he was called away by an unnatural rebellion of his sons at the supposed instigation of their mother found means to get access to her and compelled her to swallow poison frequent walks in this delightful recess sacred to the moments of contemplation suggested the following thoughts for the publication of which let the alarming progress of lewdness and consequently of licentiousness of manners which indeed threatens the dissolution of our state be accepted as an apology  on illicit love  musaeus the moral muse from yon monastic shade where frown the towers by envious time decayed invites my footsteps from the flowery plain and calls from follys rout to fancys train o hallowed haunts where genius loves to stray where silver isis winds her murmuring way whence seen from far aspiring to the skies the awful fanes of british athens rise where through her reeds a path as we explore some startled halcyon seeks the farther shore and all her woods and winding groves among the lonely philomela swells her song around thy verdant olives peace arise thy radiance learning shines to distant skies o sacred scenes remembrance shall renew and fancys eye with frantic bliss review soon shall i cease to linger with delight and mid your willows meet a noonday night doomed on thy banks commercial tyne to roam where levling phrenzy finds her favorite home where crossed ambition cursing all she hates ah dark disturber of the peace of states misleads with lies an undesigning train and drags the many in her magic chain where party rages with her gothic powers nor spares the muses shade nor sions bowers her rankling spleen some vilest trash betrays that meant for malice proves the highest praise her lewdest libels court the public shame her base assassins wound each envied name pleased i renew my walks by isis stream indulging fancys sweet extatic dream in learned ease with devious steps i stray where lonely contemplation points my way the sedgy margin often her step retains when sober evening frees the servile swains a softened smile unbends her brow austere serenely grave and pleasingly severe retarded now mid godstows walls she stands walls famed of yore the work of pious hands of ages past each distant deed appears and rise the scenes of long elapsed years in her revolving mind tears fill her eyes while henrys woes and rosamunds arise woes that still warn us from this wreck of time a frailty famed and farrenowned crime ah hapless maid the aetherial power began while pensive sadness through my bosom ran what moved thee first thy fathers to disgrace the boast and brand of cliffords noble race could icy age thy youthful breast inspire or ever gray hairs enkindle green desire loves living smile ambitions frowns devour and pleasure flies the rude embrace of power could henrys crown a charm so powerful prove to blanch the negro front of lawless love too justly blamed to blast whose fame conspire a lover old wronged queen and injured sire i see the father tear his hoary hairs and beat a bosom racked with hopeless cares invoke high heaven on henrys head to shower the vengeful lightenings of incensed power bare the red arm against the adultrous flame and hide in dust a darling daughters shame the prayrs preferred  nor ever move in vain the holy lips of age incensed by pain wars stern alarms their infant loves annoy and black remorse succeeds the blaze of joy in vain has woodstock reared her haughty towers in vain immured thee in meandring bowers eludes no labrinth guilts intrusive eyes and conscience follows wheresoeer she flies how changed by absence this alludes to the wars in normandy which called henry away soon after the commencement of this unhappy amor every haunt remains the scene of pleasures past of present pains there mourn frail maid till over the murky gloom repentance shine to mitigate thy doom by man unheard unwept and unforgivn the mercy earth denies draw down from heaven the dark retreats stern jealousy explores fates clue conducting through the mazy doors see guilt at once and injured love arraign while pity pleads and mercy moves in vain nor sighs nor prayers nor tears in torrents shed avert the doom from her devoted head till poisons spumy bowl avenged the spotted bed here paused the power and having gleaned her store from ages past to future framed her lore be warned ye fair she cried by cliffords fate what vengeful woes on lawless love await the phantoms fairy pleasure raised shall fall and soon her luscious sweets be dashed with gall still pleasure flies from guilt on flitting wings and mid her flowers the serpent sorrow stings transcribe the tale the history of rosamond inscribed on the wall of the chapel which is now converted into a stable  that on this wall is wrought the tablet hangs a toilette for your thought here look  nor to those flattering mirrors fly where souls are poisoned by the pleasurd eye nor vainly wish to future fortunes blind lucretias face without her fairer mind think then and from the crime let thought restrain for transient joys what lasting ills remain the fall in vain from honors height you mourn in vain with tears to ruthless man you turn as soon the streams that down the valleys stray shall backwards to their fountains force a way sooner shall frost its freezing powers forego and africs soot be changed to europes snow than blasted beauty shall its bloom regain or female honor soiled remove the stain o think as over the insidious glass you lie when conscious pleasure sparkles in the eye when caution sleeps and to the unguarded mind conceit and pride an easy entrance find how sense shall surfeit over the fairest face if minds too mix not in the warm embrace how soon the vivid flush of beauty flies though blossoms please us it is the fruit we prize with care o cultivate in earliest youth perennial charms faith modesty and truth charms that surviving beautys boasted claim rise phoenixlike from the funereal flame of equal worth no earthly good is told golcondas gems nor all peruvias gold still britain boast by circling waves embraced her young men valiant and her maidens chaste no more on fashions frothy tide be borne but stem the torrent you alone can turn no more with smiles the rakes lewd wishes fan refuse of stews and relics of the man with coy reserve the insidious villain view false to himself can he have faith to you the foplings fond impertinence despise and blast his hopes with your disdainful eyes to him in vain your rival charms are shown narcissuslike he loves himself alone against vice in vain religion still inveighs while passion sleeps nor heeds the unmoving lays from beautys lips the living lore would charm and coldest unbelief with ardor warm her chastning power the scorners pride would own and atheists tremble at her angel frown through errors maze a leader she would prove and light the lamp of pure celestial love on thules heathy heights see virtue stand with lingering looks prepared to leave the land to waste in northern night the lonely hour and mourn mid heclas caves her ravished power see fond affection warn her ever she flies and turn to you her supplicating eyes where hope still struggles through each crystal tear that watery shines and streaks the gloom of fear recall her with your smiles confirm her reign the traitorous rival of her empire slain for yours for albions sake retard her flight when virtue sets it is beautys blackest night in vain you will mourn the absence of her ray to ruthless lust an unresisting prey find civil order to confusion hurled and mental darkness overwhelm the world again from lust wars fatal flame shall blaze and other helens future troys shall raze soon sickening nature find the abortive grave and sink like sodom in perditions wave nor thou fond youth with boiling blood elate ah heedless of the gathering storms of fate with sophist fuel heap the blazing fire nor plead the ungoverned rage of rapt desire desire newborn in the impassioned breast by reasons sacred power is soon suppressed but fanned by sloth by reason unrestrained the headlong heights of frantic lewdness gained their mounds in vain preventive laws oppose in vain her lash shall angry power disclose powrs lash is spurned and laws eluded care nor yields the fury but to fell despair o could the muse in virtues interests warm thy softened soul from siren pleasures charm she would conjure thee by the chains that bind the social frame and rivet mind to mind by all the sacred charities of life and dearest ties of daughter sister wife if fervid honor ever fired thy soul or passion stooped to reasons chaste control if ever religion watchful in thy breast each wanton thought in embryo suppressed some fathers fairest hopes from ruin save nor give his hoary honors to the grave no more the fort of female virtue prove with artful vows the artillery of love of feigned love  that tempting to foul sin assails without and undermines within for pitys sake the friendless orphan spare nor lure the wretched to thy lustful snare ah hapless maid to hardest trials born when fortune lours upon her opening morn the dangerous boon of tempting charms bestows and gives without its guardian thorn the rose soon must the shortlived flower its sweets forego and ruffian lust shall crop them ere they blow when falshoods wiles the unwary maid betray ah meanest conquest over unguarded prey soon must the sad alternative be tried when vice has vanquished shame and pleasure pride in prostitutions public shrine to bleed till poignant pains to fleeting joys succeed till every evil tried intemprance knows wished death cut short the varied line of woes or scorch loves fruit by fell abortions flame and blast by murder the firstborn of shame who but must shrink from the sad scene distressed and mourn the mischief from his inmost breast who but would bind in vengeance penal chain the base betrayers of the virgin train yet know ye prowling wolves to pity blind that spare no lambkins of the female kind who love perverts with nature wages strife love the great second cause in worlds of life as sages say attractions secret chain in worlds of matter binds the starry train a cement thus of souls affections prove and living natures all upborne by love who lewdly blind this passion points astray and gives to govern what heaven bid obey too late shall find when frantic lust enslaves that giantlike it is heaven itself he braves hail holy flame aetherial pure desire enlivening man as erst prometheus fire all nature kindles at thy bursting beam and lands with life and oceans waters teem thy ray on greenlands icy mountains glows and keener burns mid zemblas frozen snows to glorys heavenly heights how do thou lead the sacred source of every daring deed by thee the soldiers dauntless bosoms steeled when danger braves him in the embattled field love points the falchion speeds the scythed car and beautys spoils repay the wounds of war for thee the statesman plans his deep design and by thy light the courts gay circles shine thy power even palled ambitions votries prove and care finds respite in the arms of love for thee the scholar spends his midnight oil a purer passion animates his toil than fame  that faint as echos faintest breath nor lives in life nor can be heard in death supremely blessed if laboring long he find the laurel wreath with lovers myrtle twined for thee the sailor every storm outbraves and lucys smile oerpays the frowning waves at eve slow plodding from the labored plain mild phillis kiss revives her fainting swain how high reward when toil his task foregoes to find on beautys bosom soft repose search then all life each state condition prove the purest pleasure flows from virtuous love o bliss sincere if bliss sincere can be in the dull sphere of dark mortality when sense and soul conspire to feed a flame that burns through age unchangeably the same even brighter burns and brighter still the fire that virtue lighted up and pure desire nor time whose envious rage would all remove can clip the wings of chaste connubial love frail man no more of mental ills complain nor mourn the progress of corporeal pain pandoras deadly dole whence evil rose the fated source of neverceasing woes one good that every ill oerpayd confined and woman was the hope still left behind o woman source of every dear delight that draws the enamored soul and charms the sight in whom concenters each attractive grace that decks the mind and deifies the face your rubied lips distill auroras dew your breath has sweets that hybla never knew your eyes outshine the silver orbs of night serenely gay and mild with softened light o may the guardian of so great a prize hesperian honor watch with argus eyes breasts so serene no ruder passions tear nor poison lurk in flowers so passing fair so shall your arms an amulet still prove to ward off withering care the bane of love for ah in vain your beauties heaven bestowed if vicious passion foul their fair abode vice draws her deadliest bane from beautys power the rankest poison from the richest flower nor greater lures her magic charms among not circes potion nor the sirens song precarious blessing to best ends designed but proved too often the bane of woman kind who drink the poison of thy treacherous eye with circe stabling in the swinish sty more than deform their makers choicest grace and mar the mintage of the fairest face the cherub beauty changed foregoes her light like rebel angels plunged in rayless night from highest heights to lowest depths declined and fallen womans an infernal kind but chiefly ye over honors bounds that fly by lust unloosd from hymens holy tie ye joined in hand though ill your heart accords who fail of fealty to your lawful lords yet shall the muse indignant of your charms against female falsehood wield her dreaded arms though lavish nature every grace bestows and blends the lilly with the vermeil rose the faultless form with the celestial face attemperd to proportions sweetest grace charms that intense as cleopatras prove and flinty valor fuse in flames of love abhor
