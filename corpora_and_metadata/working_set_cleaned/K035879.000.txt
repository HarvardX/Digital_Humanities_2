an enquiry into occasional conformity showing that the dissenters are no way concerned in it  by the author of the preface to mr how  london printed in the year mdccii  an enquiry into occasional conformity he that opposes his own judgment against the current of the times ought to be backed with unanswerable truths and he that has that truth on his side is a fool as well as a coward if he is afraid to own it because of the currency or multitude of other mens opinion  it is hard for a man to say all the world is mistaken but himself but if it be so who can help it  but since it is not likely a single vote should prevail upon espoused errors in an age when every one is so fond of themselves he that starts truth by himself must expect the world will stand still and look on till they see the issue  the act depending in the house of commons about occasional conformity has set abundance of heads to work in the world and be the house in the right or in the wrong i know my own business and their temper too well to meddle with it but i pretend to say that all men i have met with who have meddled with the argument either in print or otherwise are manifestly mistaken  with more humility therefore than i owe to any man i ask leave not to be censured till i am heard and those who call me arrogant before reprove me with more arrogance than is their share among their fellow creatures  but since i who was altogether born in sin have undertaken to teach my superiors i desire to explain my self before they cast me out of the synagogue  for as that blind man thought twas a mavelous thing they should not know whence he came that had opened his eyes  so to me it is every jot as wonderful to find no body of my mind and yet be positively assured that i am in the right  the subject i am upon needs no introduction the history is in every mans knowledge the parliament are upon a bill to prevent occasional conformity and about that bill the press swarms with pamphlets the pulpit sounds with exultations on one hand and deprecations on the other every one speak their opinions some their hopes some their fears and so it should have been to the end of the chapter if i could have found but one middle sort that free from prejudice of parties could have discerned the native state of the case as it really is distinguished from the passions and follies of men  about this act of parliament i affirm most of the people i have met with are mistaken and that i may be as explicit as i can i shall enquire more particularly who are mistaken how and then i doubt not the sequel of this paper shall make it appear that the fact is true  first all those people who designed the act as a blow to the dissenting interest in england are mistaken  secondly all those who take it as a prelude or introduction to the further suppressing of the dissenters and a step to repealing the toleration or intend it as such are mistaken  thirdly all those who think the dissenters at all concerned in it or have designed to mortify them by it are mistaken  fourthly all those hotspurs of divinity who prophecy destruction from the pulpit and from this step pretend to foretell that the time of plundring their brethren is at hand   fifthly all those phlegmatic dissenters who fancy themselves undone and that persecution and desolation is at the door again are mistaken  sixthly all those dissenters who are really at all disturbed at it either as an advantage gained by their enemies or as a real disaster upon themselves are mistaken  seventhly all those dissenters who deprecate it as a judgment or would vote against it if it were in their power are mistaken  eighthly that all those who begun or promoted this bill with a design to ruin weaken and destroy the interest or body of the dissenters in england are mistaken  not that i hereby suppose the parliament or the persons originally concerned in moving this bill did it in mere kindness to the dissenters in order to refine and purge them from the scandals which some people had brought upon them that twas an action of christian charity to the dissenters to prevent and detect frauds and hypocrisy in religion and to clear their reputation  i never yet saw or read of a division of parties in any nation but that the hot heads of both parties were always for enflaming the reckoning if the hot men of the dissenters have done any mischief i am sorry for it but let us examine a little what other hot men would be now a doing  no sooner was queen anne settled upon the throne of england and had declared that the church of england should be the men of her favor as being the church she had been educated in and ever constant to but these hot men fly out upon their brethren with all the excesses of their furious temper  nothing would serve them but this queen and this parliament must root and branch blast the dissenters with their breath blow up their interest in the nation and we should be all one church and one people of a sudden twas to be done with a blow all at once and so certainly that no possible doubt could be made of it  but her majesty was pleased to let these people know from her own mouth that for as much as concerned her they were mistaken in that upon the address of the dissenters to her she gave them her royal word for her protection and whenever she breaks it we shall all be mistaken  upon this the pulpit that drum ecclesiastic began the war and mr sachavrell in his sermon at oxford dooms all the dissenters to destruction without either bell book or candle not regarding common decency not respecting his good manners to the queen nor his deference to the parliament but tells them it is their duty if they will be true members of the church of england to lift up a standard against the phanaticks and the like as much as to say madam whatever your majesty has promised you must break your word and gentlemen of the house of commons we will have you do it  now all these gentlemen have lived to see themselves mistaken and if they retain any expectations of seeing it fulfilled they must exercise their faith upon it as a thing in futuro and believe that some time or other her majesty will break her word but as yet there is no great probability for hitherto we have seen they are all mistaken  but to revive their expectations comes a bill into the house for preventing occasional conformity this has been matter of great triumph to some gentlemen who upon this act revive their common discourse and are pleased to treat the dissenters in this manner well gentlemen now down you go the parliament are a beginning with you and they dont use to do business by halves they have taken the insulted church into consideration they will reduce you and this is the first step you shall soon see some more on it we have got a churchparliament now and down ye go this bill will effectually ruin your interest and bring all your great men off from you  this brings us close to the point and it is no small matter for any one to show these gentlemen how they are mistaken  first it is time for these gentlemen to tell us what the parliament will do when they either know it or the house has declared their intentions and till they have it is a presumption some houses would have taken notice of for any people to pretend to lead them to their business and therefore when they tell us this is a taste of the rest they are preparing for us i must say either they are too well acquainted with the mind of the house or they are all mistaken and as to the blow this bill is to the dissenters interest in england  as far as i may be allowed to give my judgment and as the nature of the thing seems to speak its self it is plain this bill is no damage at all to the dissenters in england and we hope the house did not intend it as such  i cannot imagine that so great a spirit of enmity and contempt can be entertained in the breast of a nation against their neighbors their brethren people born in the same climate submitting to the same government professing the same god and in most fundamental points of religion agreeing people linked together in the same common interest by intermarriages continually mixed in relation concerned in the same trade making war with the same enemies and allied with the same friends were it not that these people called dissenters are represented to them under some strange and untrue character or that under the name of dissenter some ill persons are shrouded and disguised who deserve to be thus treated  wherefore in order to set the dissenters right in the eyes of their brethren and that they may have common justice at least if they can have nothing of courtesy that peace may be where there is no occasion for war and quietness and good manners preserved twill be needful to set the matter in a true light and examine who this dissenter is what the people called dissenters are and what they have done for which they are treated after so infamous a manner by scurrilous preachers and scandalous pamphleteers and other ignorant people not a few  the dissenter is an englishman that being something desirous of going to heaven having heard his church of england father and schoolmaster and the minister of the parish talk much of it begins seriously to enquire about the way thither and to that purpose consulting his bible and his conscience he finds that in his opinion there are some things in the established way of worship which do not seem to correspond with the rule he has found out in the scripture  now i shall not examine here whether the man thus scrupulous be in the right or whether the church be in the right it does not at all belong to the case in hand  but the man being fully convinced that he ought to worship god in that way exclusive of all others which is most agreeable to the will of god revealed in the scripture and being on mature consideration also and after sincere endeavors to be otherwise satisfied fully convinced that this established way is not so near to that rule as it ought to be ventures the displeasure of the civil magistrate in dissenting in pure obedience to the commands of his conscience and of that rule which bids him obey god rather than man firmly believing that it is his duty so to do and that the compass and extent of humane laws do not reach to bind him in matters of conscience at the same time living in charity with all the rest of the world whose consciences do not require the same restriction and peaceably submitting to the laws and government he lives under as far as either his right as an englishman or his duty as a christian can require  this is the english protestant dissenter which i have been speaking of and concerning whom i have ventured to say so many men so much wiser than i are mistaken  if there are crept into his company state dissenters politic dissenters or any that give no reason or other or less reasons for their dissenting than these they are not of them and we wish they would go out from them  i see no act of parliament a making to the prejudice of this dissenter and let hot men preach print and say what they please it is impossible it should ever enter into the breast of an english protestant parliament or an english protestant queen either to oppress or suppress such a dissenter  it is for the protection of this honest wellmeaning dissenter that in the late reign the king and parliament finding their number great thought it was meet for the quiet of the nation and as an acknowledgement of the superiority of conscience to all humane laws to settle their liberty in an act of parliament the same undisputed authority on which all our civil as well as religious rights are established  this is the dissenter to which her majesty has promised her protection and this act of parliament is the toleration to tender consciences for which her majesty openly declared her self even to the hazard of her royal person  these are the dissenters who never gave her majesty any reason to believe they did not merit her protection and i firmly believe never will  from these the church of england has nothing to fear unless their exemplary lives and unquestioned piety should prevail to weaken her numbers and we heartily wish all the strife were reduced to this viz who should live best and who should preach best  if there are among them vicious youths or grown hypocrites if there are crept in errors heresies and enthusiasts are not the same among the church if there are among these dissenters quakers antinomians sweet singers muggletonians and the like the church has also her socinians deists anti  trinitarians scepticks asgilites and the like there can be no advantage pleaded against heresy and damnable heterodox opinions from one side more than another  if we regard the matters of state the dissenters and the church of england have small advantage of the argument one against another and i may without arrogance challenge the hot churchmen who can treat them with nothing but the odious name of disturbers of the peace enemies of monarchy and authors of confusion to bring the loyalty of the church of england so much boasted of in the world to the test with the loyalty of the dissenter and as it has lately been done to my hand it is new test of the church of englands loyalty p easy to prove that the dissenter has been equally loyal to princes equally true to the government and constitution of england as the church and the church has been equally disloyal and has as often resisted and took arms against the lawful established power and prince as the dissenter and let them enter into this dispute whenever they please  but what is all this to the present case what we do as englishmen is one thing and what we do as christians and dissenters is another  it is also foreign to our purpose to examine or reply to dr stubbs or the multitude of pamphleteers who place themselves at the forelorn hope of the church and begin the war in hopes of drawing on that whole body to an engagement when they can make it out that the dissenter and the church are as far asunder in religion as god and baal i may possibly think they merit what they so much covet viz to be replied to  whole reams of paper are spoiled since that to prove that this act of parliament is needful because it is fit the church should be established to which i answer with a question asked once with much less reason in another case what need all this waste  gentlemen establish your church with all the precaution you can build a fence of impregnable laws about it you are welcome we never did nor we do not now disturb you leave but us your poor brethren liberty to serve god according to our consciences dont bind us to do as you can do whether we can or no take your places and pensions and profits and deserve them of the nation if you can we ask nothing but our rights and what is now become so by law if you claim the civil power as your own you consequently take us into your protection and let us see how generous you will be  as to those among us who can conform to your church for a place for a salary you are also welcome to take them among you and let them be a part of your selves all the converts you can make by the mammon of unrighteousness are your own all you can buy off or bribe off or fright off let em go we readily grant that whoever among us can with satisfaction to his conscience conform ought to conform and we heartily wish you would make some small steps by way of condescension to your brethren such as might open a door for us all to conform to you and then you should see whether we dissent from principles of obstinacy and ill nature or from a mere necessity of conscience you should then see whether the dissenters in england were schismatics by nature and heterodox by inclination or whether their objections are grounded upon scripture and their dissenting from you an act of an enlightened conscience you would then try the spirits whether they be of god  but since you are of the opinion that you are capable of no amendment that you cannot reform farther and therefore will not condescend one step though twould bring over half a million of souls to you an eminent instance of the charity of your church all we have to say in the case is let us have the protection of the government and the liberty the laws allow us and we are content  upon this score it is that we say the act against occasional conformity does not concern us they who can conform for one reason may conform without two and ought to conform and we are therefore content to be distinguished who cannot conform at all and if we might offer so boldly to you who have any interest in the house of commons we would humbly propose to have the title of the act altered and to have it entitled an act for the better uniting the protestant dissenters by preventing occasional conformity to the church of england and when that is done let it pass with all our hearts and though we can easily see what the design is viz that no dissenter shall be employed in place of trust or profit in the government yet since it must be so we hope gentlemen you will be content to take all the miscarriages of the government on you too we shall acquiesce let us alone in our religion let us worship god as we believe he has directed us and all the rest is your own  but before we part let us have leave to remind you that although we are willing to quit all our civil right to the honors as well as the advantages of serving our country when we are chosen to it by a fair majority rather than not enjoy our religion and the profession we make with peace and liberty yet it is no less an oppression upon us and the hardships are such as can never be defended by reason or equity  we would be glad we had no cause to think our selves injured and to such of the church of england who can judge without prejudice we would appeal whether it is not very hard  first that the dissenter shall be excluded from all places of profit trust and honor and at the same time shall not be excused from those which are attended with charge trouble and loss of his time  secondly that a dissenter shall be pressed as a sailor to fight at sea listed as a soldier to fight on shore and let his merit be never so much above his fellows shall never be capable of preferment no not a lieutenant at sea or so much as a halbert in the army  thirdly that we must maintain our own clergy and your clergy our own poor and your poor pay equal taxes and equal duties and yet not be thought worthy to be trusted to set a drunkard in the stocks  we wonder gentlemen you will accept our money on your deficient funds our stocks to help carry on your wars our loans and credits to your victualing office and navy office  if you would go on to distinguish us get a law made we shall buy no lands that we may not be freeholders and see if you could find money to buy us out  transplant us into towns and bodies and let us trade by our selves let us card spin knit weave and work with and for one another and see how you will maintain your own poor without us  let us freight our ships apart keep our money out of your bank accept none of our bills and separate your selves as absolutely from us in civil matters as we do from you in religious and see how you can go on without us  if you are not willing to do this but we must live among you trade work receive and pay together why may we not do it in peace with love and unity without daily reproach if we have any knaves among us take them if we have any hypocrites any who can conform and do not we are free to part with them that the remainder may be all such as agree with the character here given and when you have garbld us to your hearts desire and ours you need never fear your church as to her politic interest in the world pray then let us be quiet  what have we to do with your distinctions of whig and tory no farther that i know of than this that when distinct from our religious concerns we come to talk of our liberties properties and english privileges we are not for having them destroyed by absolute authority dispensing power and the like and if this be to be whigs we are all whigs  as to kings and rulers we are of the opinion that when they degenerate into tyrants oppress their people destroy the laws with all the etcaeteras of arbitrary power it is lawful for the injured people to reduce them to reason and to seek protection and powerful help from any body to assist them to recover their undoubted rights and liberties if this be to be traitors why then gentlemen of the church of england hold up your hands how say you are you guilty or not guilty  as to oaths with which gentlemen ye were the men that loaded your allegiance farther than you had any occasion we are of the opinion that they can bind the subject no longer than the sovereign continues the protection of the executive power and that the late king by his deserting the throne absolved all his subjects from the bond of their allegiance and on this foot we made no scruple to swear to the government as it now stands on the foot of the late revolution and if you have sworn with us and yet do not believe so you may get off of the perjury if you can  and what need is there now of running down the dissenters with a full cry as if this act a coming out was a machine to blow them all up we see no harm in it at all other than the hardships we mentioned before most of which we suffered before and are like only to have them the faster entailed on our posterity  all those gentlemen therefore who think this act will weaken the dissenters or wish it would are manifestly mistaken it may distinguish them better and i am persuaded will fortify them in their honest profession twill teach them that if they will hold fast the truth they must learn to live like people under the power of those who hate them and despightfully use them  the dissenters too are strangely mistaken in their apprehensions of the ill consequences of this act  to such i would say i cannot imagine what they have to fear from it or why they should be uneasy with the honor they are also rid of the encumbrance of being mayors aldermen jurats and sheriffs of the towns and corporations and let them but reflect what was the gain that all the dissenters in england have made by places and pensions from the government since the late revolution i am persuaded twill not all amount to the sum that one churchman will be found to have cheated the nation of  the church are willing to engross all the knaves to themselves and let them do it and welcome though they get all the money into the bargain if they would but come to a fair account with us now and repay all the dissenters money the nation has been cheated of by church knaves i dare undertake the dissenters shall repay all that can be charged on their knaves out of the balance  the foundation of the dissenters safety is lodged by gods especial providence in the queens veracity while her majesty esteems her word sacred as she has assured us she will we have no occasion to be concerned at all  the safety of the dissenters consist in their own honesty and integrity while they do nothing to offend either her majesty or the laws if it were possible to have a parliament of church biggots or of pulpit sachaverells there will be no fear of their liberty  as to the present act i doubt not but they will live to see cause to be thankful for the making it when the miscarriages of all people in public offices and employments are so eminently fixed upon a party and so openly and fairly taken off from them  they are mistaken too in the sense of the present parliament and they may be assured had not their enemies seen that an english protestant parliament as this is is not to be prevailed upon to overthrow so substantial a part of the nations liberty as is settled in the act of toleration they had not rested so long but before now had attempted it  they have tried it in the pulpit scattered it in scandalous pamphlets from the press affirmed that toleration is destructive of the churchs as well as the nations safety they have endeavored by calumny and reproach to blacken the dissenters with crimes never committed and which they would never own before are at last come to represent them as a formidable party  and yet all this could never bring so much as one member of the house to be so blind to his countrys interest as to make a motion against the act of toleration  being thus disappointed and willing to play at small game rather than stand out they fly to the sanctuary of this bill and feign themselves gratified by it more than ever the bill or the house it self intended for in all their arguments for the bill it is supposed to be a means to reduce humble and mortify the dissenters ridiculus mus is this all why really gentlemen had it been in our power you should have had all this without an act of parliament this will strengthen not reduce us twill please not mortify or humble us and thus you find your selves all mistaken mistaken in the house of commons themselves in thinking the representatives of a protestant nation will repeal the act of toleration upon which the tranquillity of their native country so much depends but above all mistaken in their expectation of the queen to whom their behavior is preposterous and unmannerly  twas preposterous for people to expect that because the queen was a friend to the church a constant member and always espoused the interest of the church that therefore when she came to the crown she must come up to all their extravagant heights  when her majesty was princess and a subject she constantly adhered to the interest of the church but at the same time declared her opinion for tolerating the dissenters in their liberty of protestant worship while they behaved themselves quietly and obediently under the government  when her majesty came to the crown she became the general mother the guardian the refuge of all her subjects she places the church first in her favor promises them her special and particular care as those who by judgment and inclination she stands engaged with but as she finds a great number of her people unhappily divided in opinion yet in all other respects her good subjects what can she do less than give them her protection this she has readily promised them and on this they thankfully depend  but here comes the gentlemen of the long gown and they tell her in so many words she cannot she must not keep her word with us they tell us she will halt between god and baal if she does not so declare for the church as to her best to suppress and destroy all separate worships and have all the priests of baal the best terms they can bestow on the dissenting ministers hewed to pieces before the lord  it is unmannerly that the church of englandmen should expect the queen to break her word with some of her subjects to oblige others and that whereas she has promised them her special favor they should not be content with that unless she will at the same time oppress two millions of her faithful people to oblige them  let them go on but let them be assured the dissenters shall enjoy their liberty of conscience till they can prevail with her majesty to lay aside her veracity and forget her royal word and refuse us her protection which we are resolved never to give her any reason for  as to the bill against occasional conformity it baulks their design on the dissenters for it is for their advantage they always disliked the practice it has more than once been protested against and exploded and i dare undertake not one dissenter offers to present a petition to the house against its passing  it is plain that occasional communion is contrary to the very nature and being of a dissenter who if he can conform ought to conform and if he can for a place of preferment ought to do it without that preferment  it is plain that whatever by the connivance of remiss ministers and with too much regard to parties may have been slightly passed over yet by the very constitution and foundation of a collected separate church or congregation no man can go back to the communion of the church of england and be received again upon any other condition but as a penitent it is an act destructive of all possible pretense for dissenting and never was nor never can be defended by any dissenter without overthrowing all the reasons they could ever give for dissenting  how then can this bill be aimed at the dissenters either they who think it is aimed at them are mistaken or they that point it at them are mistaken for suppressing an error crept in among them contrary to their constitution against their judgment declared by them to be a grievance can never be their injury nor ought not to be their trouble  let them name us the dissenter that ever vindicated this practice one passionate author excepted let them tell us the time when any congregation received such a conforming nonconformist without diatisfactions and discontents let them tell us a time whenever the thing was practicd till the reign of king james  it is a novelty an abuse crept in among us and we are glad to have it condemned by authority at the same time not at all thinking our selves obliged to the authors for their good will  twill be objected this is a feint to close with a thing when you cannot help it  no gentlemen we dont tell you we like that part of the bill which excludes us from the native honors and preferments of our country which are our due our birthright equally with our neighbors and to which we should be called by the suffrage of the people and we cannot but think it a hardship beyond the power of reason to justify but since this right must be clogged with so many inconveniences that we must mortgage our consciences to enjoy them no man can have any charity left for us but must presently conclude we shall freely forego such trifles for our consciences or else that we have no consciecnes at all  therefore it is no feint we are so content with the suppressing the grievance of this scandalous ambodexter conformity that we think the hardships put upon us with it not worth naming we doubt not the parliament will one time or other see cause to do us justice and to restore to us the privileges of our ancestors and which we have done nothing to forfeit  but all the parliaments that ever were or will be can never suppress any thing among us so scandalous to our reputation and to that candor with which we desire to guide our actions nor so contrary to and destructive of the very nature of our separating from the church of england and the constitution of all our collected congregations  we acknowledge that if this was an allowed practice among us we could not pretend the character of a dissenter i have here given to be just but without question it is a most just character of all those dissenters who are conscientious and honest it is the original the nature of a dissenter what is crept in more is a corruption and we wish it extinguished and since none has said any thing of this nature but what has been said before and no church of englandman can think or speak worst of it than the truly religious dissenters have done we freely dismiss all those who can thus build with one hand and pull down with another to a liberty of declaring for the future who they are for  only pursuant to what has all along been acknowledged so far as we have handled this argument if they would accept of the friendly advice of their brethren it should be that they would for the future conform to the church of england  for it is plain he that can conform to the church to qualify himself for preferment for employment or any other such reason can conform if not he must be arrived to a degree of mastership over his conscience so as to subject it to his interest and act against light and he that can do that may do any thing and it is no matter what church he communicates with of such a man i think i trespass not upon charity to say he has all his work of religion to do over again and he also may conform till god shall give his conscience light enough to choose by and him grace to be obedient to the convictions of his own heart and whether that be to conform or dissent let him judge for himself  but if any man who has professed himself a religious dissenter shall upon the passing this act declare himself resolved to return to the dissenters i think no congregation of dissenters according to the nature of religious communion can receive him upon any other terms than as a penitent  if he has not sinned why should he repent says a learned author in this very case  i answer he either has sinned in conforming or he sinned in dissenting before or he sins in coming off for if he did not sin in conforming he ought to have continued there and his coming off is a plain schism but if he did sin he ought to acknowledge the sin which is what i mean by being received as a penitent  i am told after all this but upon what authority do you write thus you take upon you to write in the name of the dissenters what commission have you to write in the plural and how do we know that the dissenters disown this occasional communion  i answer publication is an appeal to the world if i have wrote what is not true or affirmed that in the name of the dissenters which is not their opinion i am liable to an easy confutation but as i have never yet had my argument refuted so though i have not received a formal commission truth is a general commission and any man may write it  and yet i am not without a general concurrence of all the dissenters i ever converst with and he that can answer the argument is welcome to make his negative as public as this and let the world judge who is in the right  finis
