merits deserve copy the roman roscius though a heathen while you live and when you die it may be said of you as the noble cicero every person may not know that marcus tullius cicero and roscius lived in the same century and were cotemporaries though the orator was much the younger and was taught all that energy in his orations he was so much famed for by roscius tully survived him many years he derived his line from tullius appius king of the volsci and took his name from cicer a chichpea or as we call them in england vech by having a wart on his forehead which resembled that pulse these great men cicero and roscius flourished about the year of the world    0  0 years before the birth of christ said of that celebrated actor  quis nostrum tam animo agresti ac duro fuit ut roscii morte nuper non commoveretur qui cum esset senex mortuus tamen propter excellentem artem ac venustatem videbatur omnino mori non debuisse  which of us all would be so unpolished and obdurate as not to be sensibly moved with the death of roscius who though dying in old age yet his excellent art and sweet manner of deportment influenced every one to wish him immortal with this i end and take leave to

an officer a nosegay to a lawyer a patch or a fan to a fine lady or a ribband to her lapdog  if i should tell my readers i am prevailed upon with great entreaties from my friends to publish this piece i should embark with a falsehood for it is my own free will act and deed and i would willingly have my readers believe i publish naught but truth my cargo is genuine and i have taken up but little on credit  if the good reader should find better scraps of rhyme than my own which i presume will not be overdifficult i have given them distinguishing marks that there may be no doubts on that account  the numerous notes i have squeezed in are meant to divert if i lose my aim i shall content myself with considering i may be but one among ten thousand that have been mistaken  i have unnumbered thanks to many in this kingdom and in particular to a young gentleman whose goodnature has been indefatigable in my interest the other a gentleman eminent in the law who has made my cause his own it gives me great concern i am not permitted publicly to own their unbounded goodness and generosity since such sterling friends are but seldom met with by wretches in misfortune  i am unfortunate i own but as oroonoko says not ashamed of being so i bear all with patience and cheerfulness which i find has occasioned the following flight of poetry from a friend i know authors often write to themselves yet i will assure you on my veracity it is not the case here though i must allow a little vanity in my composition makes me willing to insert it  integervitae scelerisquepurus hor ode xxii say fair content loved goddess say how shall i find thy soft retreat where shall i seek thy halcyon seat or trace thy sacred way love pointed out a pleasing scene where naught but beauty could be found with roses and with myrtles crowned and named thee for its queen delusion all a specious cheat at my approach the roses fade i found each fragrance quite decayed and cursed the fond deceit at courts i have sought where splendour shone where pomp and gilded cars reside midst endless hurry endless pride but there thou wast unknown yet in the captives dreary cell lodged with a longexperiencd sage with thee thou chiron of the stage the goddess deigns to dwell integrity and truth serene have eased the labors of the breast and lulled the peaceful heart to rest midst perfidy and pain a soul like thine disrobed of guile in native innocence elate above the keenest rage of fate can greet it with a smile i would wish with horace  nec turpem senectam degere  to pass declining years without reproach  but that i find impossible falsehood and fraud are the products of the world and grow spontaneous but no more than this i forgive my enemies and shall ever cherish the memory of my friends i must ask pardon for naming mr barrington in this theater and miss bellamy in covent garden the goodness of them both have often eased an aching heart  a general history of the stage the stage is almost as old as the sacred inspiration of the muse admired when at nurse and even in its infant prattle pleasing born in greece and nourished at athens a merry author says in a prologue thespis the first professor of our art at country wakes sung ballads in a cart and though bacchus is allowed to be the father yet all nations ancient and modern esteemed it to be a sober and instructive entertainment  the early stages were indeed no more than native turf or sod and what was first exhibited of a piece simple pastoral songs sometimes mixed with scandal or abuse and may be home truths like the terrae filius at oxford or the blazoning peccadillos of two opponent members setting up for the same borough yet from these seeds of satire we owe a juvenal perseus horace and petronius and indeed the whole race of heroic epic dramatic and pastoral poets and poetry your spondees and dactyls the buskin and sock the laurel and bays  from these turf stages the players such as they were mounted a cart or some such vehicle and began to travel bag and baggage perhaps like the picture of the itinerants in scarrons comical romance hear what horace says in latin  ignotum tragicae genus invenisse camoenae dicitur and plaustris vexisse poemata thespis quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora post hunc personae pallaeque repertor honestae aeschylus and modicis implevit pulpita tignis et docuit magnumquae loqui nitique cothurno but for fear some people may understand as little latin as myself take the sense in the following english  thespis an early poet and player born at athens thespis the first that did surprise the age with tragedy never trod a decent stage but in a wagon drove his plays about and showed mean antic tricks to please the rout his songs uneven rude in every part his actors smutted and the stage a cart next aeschylus a celebrated greek poet an athenian there are several greek tragedies of his handed down to us and as casaubon imagines many more lost by some authors he is supposed to have been one of the performers in his own dramatic pieces the learned thomas stanley esquire of hertfordshire has published this ancient author in latin with the original greek on one side illustrated with elaborate notes in folio aeschylus did greater art express he built a stage and taught them how to dress in decent motion he his parts conveyed and made them look as great as those they played creech the first theater in athens was built by the directions of aeschylus at the public charge it was a wooden pile yet very spacious but at the representation of one of the tragedies composed by aeschylus according to suidas the building gave way by the monstrous weight of  0000 spectators and many were killed and maimed to prevent such fatal accidents for the future the city ordered one more magnificent to be erected entirely built with stone capable of holding half the inhabitants without the former danger some authors say of marble surpassing in elegance the temples of their gods it consisted of two parts the scena and cavea the scena that part which formed the stage and other conveniences belonging to it the upper part for their scenes and machinery which were generally flat curtains with all the variety of painting let occasionally down to vary the prospect and manage the machinery as lee intimates in the tragedy of oedipus o that as often i have at athens seen the stage arise and the big clouds descend the cavea was the place where the spectators were seated the under part of the stage was formed for raising any thing particular for the different performances where were also placed the brazen tubes for thunder and utensils for lightning and many other conveniences according to graevius with brazen thunder forked lightning hurled that blazing streamed to fright the mimic world they had also different thunder for good or bad omens according to athenaeus auspicious omen rends the womb of night and forked lightning flashes from the right and again illomend lightning has the welkin cleft and rolling thunder bellows from the left   it may well be asked by numbers if these theaters were so large and spacious what sort of theatrical performers must those distant ages produce they must either have stentrophon voices or their auditors most delicate auricular faculties no in my opinion the senses of hearing and seeing were much the same as now but as to the voice that indeed doubtless wanted assistance which to help they had coverings to the whole head and face and over the face a mask with a mouth only to strengthen the sound of the voice in my poor opinion wretched assistance where were the eyes and muscles of the countenance to command implore exult upbraid consent refuse and all those different passions that agitate the mind wherein the eyes are the index these masks were made to cover the head as was said before adorned with hair proper to the character the actor was to represent upon the stage madam dacier has given an engraved specimen of several masks used on the roman theater in her translation of terence which she procured in an ancient manuscript of that authors works the romans followed the greeks in their drama so we may be assured these helps came from athens to rome but as the voice was to be modeled so was the person therefore the cothurnus or buskin was invented not like our modern greek or roman buskin but an elevation of person half a yard or so to emulate the size of immortals or earthly giants and heroes like our waggish boys appearing upon stilts but the cothurnus was only made use of in tragedy to step stately for if they had hurried they might have been in some danger of kissing the ground neither could they i suppose pay homage to their monarch or their mistress though perhaps in those days kneeling was neither a mark of submission or adoration at least among the greeks but thus are their actors pictured out by many authors cornelius nepos tells us most of the performers on the grecian theaters were the chief of the nobility persons of great learning and dignity poets orators and historians even kings did not disdain to appear on the athenian stage but what is most surprising these monstrous piles of buildings were so contrived that two of these large theaters could turn join and form an amphitheatre for the hunting wild beasts etc  casaubon in his description of the splendour of rome says that curio a roman knight to entertain the people built two spacious theaters in such a manner back to back if it may be so termed first for the histriones histriones or actors took their name from hister in the tuscan language a player  or actors to perform in the morning in the afternoon they were moved to meet each other and form one spacious amphitheatre where the combats of gladiators and wild beasts were performed but when we consider the greek and roman engines of war the turres turres mobiles or moving towers of the greeks are the same of those of the romans which they copied from them they are used in besieging the walls of a city generally   0 foot high and  0 foot square containing many rooms in length and height capable of holding a large body of soldiers with arms and other engines ladders bridges to throw over the citywall for the soldiers to enter the town and all this mighty bulk put together in three hours as gronovius tells us with wheels that could move it forward or back by men to shove or draw to press on or retreat some of the stories filled with archers and slingers another with fireballs the rest with spears and darts etc  and a whole catalogue of others the wonder will cease  the athenian theater was beyond all doubt the primal and eldest child of the drama and consequently must have the earliest of the dramatic poets and most in number we have not many more of the roman dramatic bards after naming seneca the learned seneca was born at cordova in spain this is not the stoic philosopher whom by his moral writings hierome ranks among the list of sacred authors though both these great men were born in cordova for tragedy and plautus plautus was born in umbria in the kingdom of naples notwithstanding his reputation as a comic poet through his extravagant way of living he was at last reduced to get his subsistence by turning a bakers handmill a memento for poets as well as players  with terence terence was born at carthage the capital of africa that so long contended with the roman republic he served terentius lucanus a roman knight who recommended him to scipio and laelius there are six of his comedies left us but most taken from the greek of menander which makes the learned world regret the loss of that excellent author terence after his great success in rome embarked to visit athens but was supposed to perish at sea for he was never after heard of  for comedy and this last borrowed from the greek of menander while among the grecians we have this menander menander a celebrated greek comic poet suidas informs us that he squinted and was an inordinate lover of the fair sex plautus and terence borrowed as much from this author as our modern playwrights from corneille racine moliere renard and many of the french tribe of parnassus but whom has our immortal shakespeare pilferd from why not having the fear of heaven before his eyes he has sacrilegiously stolen from that sacred goddess nature in all her works  aeschylus sophocles sophocles was a celebrated tragic poet of athens he flourished in the year of the world    0 before the birth of christ      euripides euripides wrote    dramatic pieces although he was twice married he was accounted a womanhater various are the accounts of his death some say he was torn to pieces by women others by the king of macedons dogs he was contemporary with sophocles  and aristophanes aristophanes was born at lindus in the island of rhodes he wrote    comedies he was cotemporary with socrates and in one of his plays ridicules that great philosopher he flourished in the year of the world       the first and last for comedy the other for tragedy not forgeting lycophron lycophron an eminent tragic poet born at chalcedon a city of bithynia in asia minor and now called chiutale by the turks in whose government it now remains  therefore we may thank athens athens was built by cecrops as helvicus informs us a king of egypt in the year of the world    0    years before the israelites went out of egypt it was obeyed by kings till      of the world when the line of monarchs ended with codrus archons then were constituted in the place of regal power after the reign of    kings the hero theseus being the   th of that number who named the city athens these archons or joint rulers were nine in number and were generally hereditary solon the wise lawgiver was an athenian and formed those wholesome statutes from which they derived their excellent government see the english of the greek of what he said of himself  what power was fit i did on all bestow nor raised the poor too high nor pressed too low the rich that ruled and every office bore confined by laws they could not press the poor both parties i secured from lawless might so none prevailed upon anothers right have we better laws now these archons for life continued governors till    0 they were then changed for ten years rule only till      then it formed a direct republic and as alcibiades says in the play of timon of athens one tyrant is better than four hundred   their homebred jars made them a prey to the macedonians and afterward to the romans and though famous for war and arms yet learning and art even in their troubles raised them to be the first in the esteem though they wore the chains of rome which shall introduce the words of the oracle to the great theseus  hear theseus pitheus daughters son hear what jove for thee has done in this great city thou have made he has as in a storehouse laid the settled periods and fixed fates of many cities mighty states but know thou neither fear nor pain solicit not thyself in vain for like a bladder that does bide the fury of the angry tide thou from high waves unhurt shall bound always tossed but never drowned duke athens is now called atheni by the turks there are computed  000 christians and  000 turks who command the town the aga resides in the acropolis or castle built upon a rock a mile in circumference within it is a mosque that when athens flourished was the temple of minerva built of white marble     foot in length and  00 in breadth and as wheeler says was one of the finest structures in the world near it are some of the remains of the theater of bacchus the area and the stage are almost filled with the ruinous marble seats but it is plain to be discovered that this theater is much larger than the temple of minerva and built with white marble the temple of the eight winds some remains of the odeum or music theater etc may be still distinguished   for her schools of science and arts whose flourishing branches by degrees spread over the now learned world as horace writes in his epistle to augustus caesar graecia capta ferum victorem cepit and arts intulit agresti latio greece conquered did her conquerors overcome polished the rude and sent her arts to rome  the socci is no more than we say in english seck and used in comedy only for tragedy with the chorus and comedy were a long time the greek and roman entertainments the chorus might indeed be termed interludes though their substance were mostly relative to the story as thoughts of the foregoing subject of the scene by standersby or overhearers yet these by degrees melted away and mimes or pantomimes were instituted in their room some of our english authors have their chorus after the ancient manner viz shakespeare in his henry v and winters tale milton in his samson agonistes sandys in his christs passion and the late duke of buckingham in his two tragedies from the julius caesar of our shakespeare and others the mimes and pantomimes crept in and should out these ancient choruss some were loose and wanton mimics that the roman luxury too well liked others were more decent who by action and gesture could describe a story without speaking in all its variety of passions one of these was so excellent that when a foreign prince came to rome in the time of nero the tyrant at his departure he asked no other favor of the emperor but that mime whom he had seen perform for this reason that as he had many barbarous nations bordering round him of different speech this man by his action could be an excellent interpreter whose meaning was so well understood without the use of speech mimes and pantomimes are generally the same thing but to translate them buffoons as cooper in his dictionary is something too low a meaning i shall leave the ancients to rest quietly in their graves  the drama in england and all over europe began as meanly as its first original in greece or rome and our poetry as crude the first play at least that has appeared in print was with this title gammer gurtons needle a comedy acted at christscollege cambridge writ by mr s master of arts and an artful piece it is gammer gurton has lost her needle and truly great hunt is made about it her boy is sent to blow the embers in order to light a candle to help the search the damned witch of a cat is got in the chimney with her two fiery eyes the boy cries it is the devil of a fire for when he puffs it is out and when he does not it is in stir it cries gammer gurton the boy does as he is bid the fire or rather the cat flies among a pile of wood the boy cries the house will be burnt all hands to work the cat is discovered by a priest having a little more cunning than the rest this is the episode the main plot and catastrophe are full as good gammer gurton it seems had the day before been mending her man hodges breeches now hodge in some game of merriment was to be punished by three slaps on the bum by the brawny open hand of one of his fellow bumpkins his head is laid down in gammer gurtons lap the first slap is given  hodge with great exclamation bellows out oh he declares his grief and searching for the cause of his pain  o happy the needle was found buried up to the eye in the posterior of poor hodge it was pulled out with great rejoicing by all but the delinquent who expressed some pain and so ends this excellent comedy  but time has polished this rudeness and true english tragedy and comedy is allowed to stand in the utmost perfection yet bunglers will still be dabbling every polite nation delights in the drama the heavy dutch have plays in their own language but they are generally planned from the old testament i had a description of one given me from an english spectator it was the story of abraham sacrificing his son isaac but abraham was armed with a gun instead of a sacrificing knife the angel to prevent the gun from firing sprinkled some warm water a distillation of its own making the ram in the brake which was represented by boughs of laurel was a plump fat dutchman married i suppose with fair browspread antlers on his head fixed very artificially and all the decorations were of a piece but they have a handsome regular theater at the hague occupyd by a french troop of comedians even the distant chinese have very fine theaters i saw in my youth a chinese performance at canton where the scenes machines and habits were surprising and magnificent but not understanding the language the glare growing familiar as addison says by beauty faded on the eye and palled upon the sense du halde in his history of china has translated into french several of the chinese dramatic authors but they seem planned mostly alike  a prince secreted in his youth by an evil minister and counterplotted by a good one the child at last brought from its obscurity married to a great princess and begins his happy reign but these illustrious ladies have but little to say for themselves no more than the lost daughters in the comedies of terence found again by the parents and married to the son of a friend tavernier in his travels to the east indies informs us that theaters have been many ages the diversion of the chinese and more magnificent than those of europe he relates a long description of them and the more to illustrate that account gives you the plan and picture of one engraved with the scenes and machines the people of america had their theater according to acosta acosta the spaniard that wrote the history of the west indies before cortez had conquered it says the amantas or indian philosophers were also poets and invented comedies and tragedies which were acted on their festivals before the king the royal family and the court the actors being the noblemen and great officers of the army the subject of their tragedies were the victories and great actions of their ancestors which seemed to be the best means they had of preserving the memory of what was past in their comedies their husbandry their household affairs and commerce were represented and the most remarkable follies in life exposed the poets taught them what they had to say not by writing but by memory for orthography was not known among the indians till after the conquest  according to lopez de vega the christian religion was propagated among the americans by the theater read in his own words what he writes upon the subject every part of gospelhistory is thrown into a play and the indians are the actors instructed by the jesuits one acts our savior another st peter a third pontius pilate a fourth judas and so on this they look upon as the readiest way of instructing the vulgar indians in the christian religion and to fix the sacred history of it in their memories    but what need we travel so far from home it is time to come back to our own country with this observation that polite nations allow the theater a wise and instructive amusement even the apostles did not disapprove of plays and no doubt read them for st paul in his first epistle to the corinthians quotes menander the greek comic poet and sets down his own phrase in his own words xvth chapter   d verse be not deceived  evil communication corrupts good manners arts sciences and even trade generally flourish with the theater and i think religion and politeness and why may not the drama be a great mark of a civilized nation the greeks and romans were in their highest glory when the stage flourished i need not say that the theater in england came in with the reformation and the longreignd queen elizabeth whose great learning not only made her give it encouragement but sir roger naunton tells us that great queen translated one of the tragedies of euripides from the original greek for her own amusement our immortal shakespeare met reward from that illustrious princess and her influence brought forth his inimitable genius to that high luster where it will shine unrivaled to after ages never once clouded but in the time of fanaticism and drear darkness of canting and hypocrisy france was poring in the thick mist till hardy their first poet showed dramatic light then all branches of learning began to shine and spread their luster improved their arts and arms and warmed their widespreading nation to glory when conquest waited on their monarch and victory covered him with laurels till checked by the british lion ambition in great minds stands ranked in the line of virtue but i think to bound it is more truly a virtue as sweettongud waller writes  if the successful troublers of mankind with laurel crowned so great applause do find shall the vexed world less honor yield to those that stop their progress and their rage oppose next to that power which does the ocean awe is to set bounds and give ambition law but let me set bounds to myself  as the stage flourished in the reign of queen elizabeth and king james the first with such excellent dramatic poets viz shakespeare ben johnson massenger and many others we may be well assured the actors did not fall much short of the writers nature is the same in every age tailor burbidge lowen hemmings condel allen mason field tarlton and others that performed in the plays of shakespeare johnson etc have their public praises in several cotemporary authors mr marlow in his preface to the jew of malta a play acted before king charles the first and his queen at whitehall in the year      writes that mr mason and mr tailor performed their parts with that excellence that it was beyond conceiving sir richard baker in his chronicles of england at the latter end of queen elizabeth after giving an account of the eminent persons in that reign writes thus of three actors excellency in the meanest things deserves remembrance richard burbidge and edward allen two such actors as no age must ever look to see the like and to make their comedies complete richard tarlton for the clowns part never had his match nor never will have what this writer calls the clowns part were such as lancelot in the merchant of venice touchstone in as you like it the fool in king lear and parts of the kind which required persons of infinite humor  mr thomas heywood was not only an excellent actor but a very great author and dramatic poet i have read all his works that are extant and in my poor judgment he may be accounted the first of the secondrankd poets in the reigns of queen elizabeth and king james the first i do not think it will displease the reader to give him a catalogue of his great labors    robert earl of huntingdons downfall   0     robert earl of huntingdons death   0  these two pieces are the history of robin hood    the golden age         the silver age         the brazen age         a woman killed with kindness         if you know not me you know nobody this is the history of queen elizabeth with a print of that great queen in the front and the spanish armada destroyed by her majestys fleet         the royal king and loyal subject         the fair maid of the west or a girl worth gold first part        0 the fair maid second part          the duchess of suffolk     the iron age first part          the iron age second part          the english traveller          a maidenhead well lost          the four london prentices with the conquest of jerusalem          a challenge for beauty          fair maid of the exchange          the wise woman of hogsdon        0 the rape of lucretia          loves mistress    0     fortune by land and sea          lancashire witches the date of this play was wanting     edward the fourth in two parts the late mr bowman informed me he was very well assured by mr cleveland a poet of the last age this double play was performed on two succeeding nights and had a very great run a theatrical term  several modern authors have borrowed from mr heywood i shall only mention two shadwell in his lancashire witches and fielding in his intriguing chambermaid from the english traveller or rather renarde the frenchman translated it into french from the english and our english privateer retook it back again though it is very possible all three might have an eye upon the mostellaria of plautus but this is sailing a little out of my latitude yet we may be very well assured this poet must be in great reputation by the number and success of his dramatic works when skakespear and fletcher were the reigning monarchs of the stage not forgetting ben johnson and massenger and i repeat it here again the stage performers must certainly be great in those times since few of our poets have outshone those that went before them more especially shakespeare and johnson this last had no other epitaph than o rare ben johnson and burbidge the tragedian by way of estimation exit burbidge mr richard allen another great actor founded and endowed a college this college was first designed for the relief and support of six men six women with six children persons through indigence misfortunes or old age belonging to the theaters of london but when the building was going forward mr allen having left off acting he recommended a doorkeeper to his quondam brother actors they absolutely refused him that small favor which so enraged him that he turned his bounty another way both parties perhaps to blame but i believe few censured him out of the theaters at that time he afterward increased the number of children to twelve from the age of five years to be taught and maintained till    or    we may imagine the founder no very great friend to matrimony since he left directions that the governor should continue a bachelor and one of his own name and to give place to another allen should he once change his condition the college is a noble building with a very handsome chapel the altarpiece elegantly painted with a welltond organ and it is the duty of the organist to teach the children to sing the proper services of the church the decent decorum is admired by all there is also an elegant pleasuregarden with a useful orchard and kitchengarden all wellstockd with the best fruits etc fish ponds that yield large quantities of carp tench perch and eels and much to the credit of the managers of this charity the original estate left by the founder is more than trebled in value and they have money in their treasury ready for another purchase i shall end this account with what sir richard baker writes in his chronicle of england where he closes the reign of king james the first about this time      edward allen of dulwich in surry founded a fair hospital at dulwich for six poor men six poor women and twelve poor children from the age of four to six years to be there maintained and taught till the age of fourteen or sixteen and to have a schoolmaster with diet and a convenient stipend this man may be an example who having gotten his wealth by stageplaying converted it to this pious use not without a kind of reputation to the society of stage players at dulwich in surry at his own private expense  we have had great generals knowing admirals worthy discoverers of new worlds as well as illustrious poets in the two last ages and why may not their cotemporary theatrical performers be as great in their way an author who wrote about forty years past speaks thus of mr betterton in the tragedy of hamlet prince of denmark mr betterton performed the part of young hamlet sir william davenant sir william davenant was by many supposed the natural son of shakespeare he succeeded ben johnson as poetlaureat in      and obtained a patent for a company of comedians from king charles and was knighted by that monarch he was accounted a great poet in several branches of that science his poem of gondibert is esteemed a noble poem which he wrote in france during his exile with king charles the second his works are printed in folio      which contains    dramatic pieces besides his poems with his head crowned with laurel the features seem to resemble the open countenance of shakespeare but the want of a nose gives an odd cast to the face i shall not inquire how he came noseless yet give you a stale jest upon the occasion sir william walking by temple bar a fishmongers boy in watering his fish upon the stall besprinkled the laureat who snuffling loudly complained of the abuse the master begged the knights pardon and was for chastising his servant with some expostulations as well as a cudgel zounds sir cried the boy it is very hard i must be corrected for my cleanliness the gentleman blew his nose upon my fish and i was washing it off that is all the jest pleased sir william so well that he gave him a piece of money and went away highly delighted since i have given you one old jest upon the nose of sir william i will venture to throw in another as he was walking along the mews an importunate beggarwoman teizd him for charity with often repeating heaven bless your eyesight god preserve your worships eye sight  why what is the matter with my eyesight woman replied sir william i find no defect there ah good sir i wish you never may returned the beggar for should your sight ever fail you you must borrow a nose of your neighbor to hang your spectacles on his play of the law against lovers is shakespeares measure for measure with a very little alteration and as little for the better sir william was the contriver of painted scenes in our english theaters as well as one of the first introducers of singing operas there is a work of this kind whose title runs thus the cruelty of the spaniards in peru expressed by instrumental and vocal music and by art of perspective in scenes at the cockpit in drury lane at three in the afternoon      having seen mr tailor of the blackfriars playhouse act this part who was instructed by the author shakespeare remembered him so well that he taught mr betterton in every article which by his exact performance gained the actor esteem and reputation superlative to all the other players this account makes it plain tailor must be very great in the part since betterton his imitator performed it so well and betterton in the memory of many was esteemed the greatest actor of his time read what the great addison writes of him who may be allowed a judge of the drama as well as the performers  such an actor as mr betterton ought to be recorded with the same respect as roscius among the romans the greatest orator tully has thought fit to quote his judgment and celebrate his life roscius was the example to all that would form themselves into proper and winning behavior his action was so well adapted to the sentiments he expressed that the youth of rome thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their appearance as roscius the imagination took a lovely impression of what was great and good and they who never thought of setting up for the art of imitation became themselves inimitable characters there is no human invention so aptly calculated for the forming a freeborn people as that of a theater tully reports that the celebrated roscius used frequently to say the perfection of an actor is only to become what he is doing i have hardly a notion that any performer of antiquity could surpass the action of mr betterton in any of the occasions in which he has appeared on our stage the wonderful agony which he appeared in when he examined the circumstance of the handkerchief in the part of othello the mixture of love that intrudes upon his mind upon the innocent answers desdemona makes betrayed in his gesture such a variety and vicissitude of passion as would admonish a man to be afraid of his own heart and perfectly convince him it is to stab it to admit that worst of daggers jealousy whoever reads in his closet this admirable scene will find that he cannot except he has as warm an imagination as shakespeare himself find any but dry incoherent and broken sentences but a reader that has seen betterton act it observes there could not be a word added that longer speeches had been unnatural nay impossible in othellos circumstances mr rymer the greatest critic of the age he lived in in his dissertation on tragedy speaks thus on mr heart  the eyes of the audience are prepossessed and charmed by his action before ought of the poet can approach their ears and to the most wretched of characters heart gives a luster which dazzles the sight that the deformities of the poet cannot be perceived  now after the opinions of two such eminent judges why may we not suppose there were as great stage performers in times past as the present without lessening the merit of those that survive if in my simple judgment i allow the present equal to the past i cannot allow that they exceed them no more perhaps than the next race of theatrical performers will excel many that now grace the stage excellency in this science does not always run in the blood or like estates follow hereditary they must be born actors as well as poets and painters yet there are many dabblers in all three but alas how few come to perfection we very rarely see brothers or sisters sons or daughters or any of the relative line though they sometimes take up the calling because one of the race flourishes in the theatrical field succeed in their attempts a monarch may give ribbands titles of honor or add to his peers but no power but that immortal goddess nature can form a perfect actor yet some even of these forget their instructress and faults invade them to sully their perfections every performer on the stage ought to take virtue for his guide precepts from the pulpit will not have all their efficacy from a monitor without morals a discourse on sobriety on a sunday would lose something of its intention from an orator known to baste the bottle about all the past saturday evening till the noon of night as shakespeare says the blind may hear the dumb and deaf see but every sense must be perfect to instruct and be instructed performers of both sexes ought to imitate those virtuous characters they represent upon the stage the dignity of the theater then might emulate that of athens it is not the business brings scandal to the performers if they will take care to avoid drawing it upon themselves i have known the managers of drury lane and many of the rest of the fraternity meet regard and even respect from persons of the first rank from their proper behavior and i am convinced every one with the like conduct would meet with the like treatment from people of sense and good breeding but the twoleggd brutes of the creation will be ever incorrigible a decent dress will become their station but pride ought to be as far distant from them as the licensed instructors of divine institution for if theatrical performers are servants to the public as an eminent actor publicly declared they should never attempt to outdress their masters veluti in speculum behold as in a glass the motto over the front of drury lane theater will serve both auditors and actors and i think carries a more instructive meaning than the other of vivitur ingenio we live by wit which only relates to the stage a bad painter is seldom copied and excellence is only worth imitation dress beyond station is pride and pride very often brings selfpunishment i have known fiddlers and dancingmasters wear laced clothes but they seldom improved any thing but the taylors bill and as much laughed at as the baboon i have often seen in a laced coat and a bagwig in the parade at bartholomewfair  yet i have seen gold fringe on silk vests with white silk stockens worn by the dancers on the ropes at sadlerswells that have bowed and scraped in that rich dress picking up halfpence thrown down by cobblers and linkboys such sights put me in mind of the painted eggs it is the custom of the muscovites at christmas easter and many other stated festivals to send as a friendly present to their acquaintance and relations painted eggs generally embellished with flowers curiously drawn fruits etc that are very often so expensive that the money laid out for the painting of one would purchase a hundred as simple nature produced them and are of no farther use than to be looked upon this custom is kept up chiefly in the holidays of christmas in commemoration of the eastern wise men led by the star to visit our redeemer in the manger at bethlehem where they made their presents to the divine infant these eggs are sometimes eaten in those days ordained where flesh is sorbidden but not till the sun is set or if no sun appears not till candlelight of muscovy they dont relish the better for their coloring and gaudy outsides even roscius among the romans though the actors did not keep up their reputations equal to those of athens was marked out as a pattern for the youth of rome to follow in decency of dress and morals tully says cum artifex ejusmodi sit ut solus dignus videatur esse qui in scena spectetur tum vir ejusmodi est ut solus dignus videatur qui eo non accedat  so excellent an artist that he seemed the only person to adorn the stage and yet in all other respects so complete in every grace and virtue that he seemed the only person that should not take up with such a profession  moral virtue and a decent behavior will gain esteem from people of every rank will add weight to the characters they represent and even may atone for want of excellency  lessons for the stage may be conveyed in one respect stronger than from the pulpit if the audience were attentive as they should be at church for a play well wrote and well performed where virtue suffers or meets its just reward must have strong force upon the mind where the eye is supposed to view the very persons in the real circumstances of history what then will add to this imagination why the performers to be as blameless as human nature will allow i remember a virtuous actress or one reputed so repeating two lines in king lear at her exit in the third act armed in my virgin innocence i will fly my royal father to relieve or die receive a plaudit from the audience more as a reward for her reputable character than perhaps her acting claimed when a different actress in the same part more famed for her stageperformance than the other at the words virgin innocence has created a horselaugh no reflection on the audience since a theatrical term and the scene of generous pity and compassion at the close turned to ridicule here the audience are disconcerted and the reality of the subject before them loses much of its force with the imagination debilitated if not turned another way on the other hand indeed if a person who acts iago be suspected to wear a heart that way inclined he appears stronger in that character and meets with an applause that condemns him we may find by these examples virtue is of some use upon the stage and would be more so if more practiced to give instructions to an actor is a very difficult task for if much is wanting it is not worth while to give any a rough diamond may be polished but few pebbles are worth cutting after many requisites for the stage bad action will even cause a good figure to appear awkward and though there may be rules for action yet nature is the best teacher and if an actor of good understanding is truly possessed with his character the true action will involuntarily occur i remember mrs porter to whom nature had been niggard in voice and face so great in many parts as lady macbeth alicia in jane shore hermione in the distressed mother and many parts of the kind that her just action eloquence of look and gesture moved astonishment and yet i have heard her declare she left the action to the possession of the sentiments in the part she performed i have known some tolerable actors as to countenance and elocution that have mortified both by the badness of action more especially the proper use of their hands had they worn each in a scarf they had been much more tolerable as it is the most expressive part in the action of the body so as shakespeare says like an illsheathd knife it will most hurt its master i think quintilian says all the parts of the body assist the speaker but the hands speak without a tongue supplicate threaten call dismiss provoke show every passion of the soul the hands are the general language of mankind and we need no grammar but nature to understand it so by their awkward use upon the stage we may turn the serious into ridicule mr booth would often regret the want of opportunity for an actor to continue in a graceful attitude which nicolini the italian singer was so masterly familiar with between the retornels of a song and other occasions yet when mr booth had the least opportunity he showed he only wanted it i remember in the  th act of othello while he is listening to emilias speaking to desdemona after she is supposed to be strangled he suited his attitude and countenance to the circumstances of the scene that i have not art to describe but the treble repeated applauses of the audience while he was silent spoke such high approbation that miss santlow afterward mrs booth used to say she thought the audience were pleased poor desdemona was strangled out of the way  of all the various passions of grief a manly sorrow is the most difficult to express and of all the actors i have ever yet seen i must be pardoned if i give the preference to mr wilks no heart that was capable of being touched but must have sympathizd at his manner of speaking one line in the orphan to monimia in the fifth act  my fatal love alas has ruined thee and yet i have heard it spoke when it has given me no more concern than if a voice had pierced my ear with kettles or pots to mend old brass to mend if moving the passions is a great art in acting i think mr wilks was master of that art there was no avoiding feeling his distress in another line when he performed the part of the royal merchant in the beggars bush a comedy of fletchers the character is noted for beneficent charity and when his flintyhearted creditors had just pressed him for payment clause his old beadsman though his father in disguise comes as if to beg his usual charity when the merchant replies with such a tone that sinks into the soul  clause i pray thee leave me for by my troth i have nothing now to give thee  comparison is the true touchstone of excellence and brightened brass by a false light might be taken for gold if not tried  in the  th act of macbeth when he is told by lenox of the loss of his wife and children his mixture of sorrow and manly grief at he has no children butcher if he had the thought of them would sure have stirred remorse drew tears from almost every eye when if he had blubbered like a schoolboy whipped the touching scene would have raised laughter in the place of grief and yet some particular people will not allow mr wilkss excellence to stand in tragedy if indeed he had attempted the parts of cato lear macbeth henry the viiith melantius and a countless catalogue of others in the same class i might have joined in their opinion but while there is a juba an edgar macduff buckingham and amintor in the same plays i dont desire to see a better performer in that cast of playing than mr wilks in hamlet he pleased all the audience and if the best judges laughed at his parts in comedy i cannot conceive they have shed more tears since his muchlamented death at any of the abovementioned plays i remember a few years ago a dispute arose between two theatrical gentlemen upon this stage concerning the propriety of a particular speech the one to enforce his argument told the other he never heard it spoke otherwise on the english stage pho replied the other disputant that was the old way of acting a truly great actor that stood by replied learn the old way first and when you are perfect then begin a new one if you can find it out art may invent fashions in our dress but nature is the same as the habits of the turks which they have never yet altered the clothes of the first ottoman prince is the model of the emperor that now reigns and as the divine pope paints the unalterable goddess  unerring nature still divinely bright one clear unchanged and universal light life force and beauty must to all impart at once the source and end and test of art i have known many actors with excellent voices so i have often known common balladsingers in the streets with strong lungs and voices but for want of a manner with judgment murder an excellent song and yet extort praise from their auditors a sowgelders horn will pierce the ear and alarm all the dogs in the parish but i believe most people would rather hear a trumpet the voice like an instrument of music must be put in tune and if managed by a skilful actor whose mind feels the passions will send out the proper tone when a bungler in music does but harshly grate upon the ear but who is ignorant of this if this is the disease of the stage where is the remedy it must certainly be in the hands of the manager though no very easy task the circumstances of a theater very often oblige the directors to thrust persons into characters too weak to support the weight of them vanity is blended in most human compositions and the stage is seldom free from it therefore when an actor is once in possession of a part male or female they think it a very great hardship to give it up to a better performer there are a much larger number of common soldiers in an army than commanding officers and we have some few instances of a soldier rising to preferment by merit whilst others grow gray with a musket upon their shoulders and yet at some time or other a soldier may do the duty of a corporal if he is indisposed or out of the way but that exigence does not give him a title to the post i remember an actor was taken into the theater in drury lane for playing the part of caesar borgia in a private play and when mr booth was studying the part he thought it the greatest oppression as he called it that could be thrown upon him nay after mr booth had performed the part with universal applause several successive nights this person said nay bound it with an oath that booth did not know how to speak a single line yet this person was a man of sense and learning but there are more requisites to make a finished actor therefore as they do not always judge heartily for themselves it is requisite they should have one of unbiased and superior knowledge to judge for them when such actors abovementioned take parts as they thrust themselves into for their benefits as is too often the case and i think ought not to be allowed it proves as shakespeare says   like a player bellowing his passion till he break the spring and his racked voice jar to the audience there are too many performers of both sexes that are fond of choosing capital parts for their benefits that sit upon them  like a giants robe upon a dwarfish thief and at the same time excuse themselves from rehearsals that should prepare them to act with some decency at least to cultivate their interest and when they come to perform at night only take shame to themselves though they often disconcert others and may truly say  like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and stop even to a full disgrace that is villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it shak the noble gift of playing well is not given to all that play yet as in building of houses there must be provided many hands even to the carrying the mortar a mortercarrier must be had as well as the rest of the hands in the work all are not equal to every part in the building no more than every actor is fit for every part if they attempt to wade out of their depths they are in great danger of drowning and as our immortal poet writes  as in a theater the eyes of men after a wellgracd actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next will think his prattle to be tedious yet i have known many persons belonging to a theater not eminent in any superior part never offend through their private characters in life a modest behavior is commendable in every station but much more observed in persons of a public profession where the eyes of thousands are upon them confidence pride and vanity will draw down contempt and ridicule from superiors with disregard from all  of all the causes which conspire to blind mans erring judgment and misguide the mind what the weak heart with strongest bias rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools pope humility affability and goodnature will claim regard from all ranks and if any stains are thrown upon the profession such qualifications will wipe them off yet i think there are no spots but what they themselves throw upon it we are apt even in strange company to out with some theatrical quotation that seldom fails of declaring what business we follow what need a tailor talk of his yard and sheers a smith of his forge or a brewer of his grains let the buskin and sock be left in the theater i know an eminent actor invited to dine in a mixed company of both sexes of condition when the dinner seemed a little tedious before it made its entrance a gentleman one of the invited starts up and cried zounds mr  give us the ghost in hamlet by way of grace the master of the house replied there was no meat he could give him was worth one speech besides he did not invite mr  to pay for his dinner that way it was only in retaliation for the supper he gave him the night before on the stage where no cook but himself could dress such a dish of black broth meaning othello so by your rule of courtesy if i had invited fausan i should have desired him to dance the buffoon before dinner this was the height of civility to one and a sufficient rebuke to the other the fop for he was no less to plead his excuse told the company he had been many times with several actors who took as much pleasure to speak speeches as he to hear them and he did not doubt but they were people of great judgment for they generally owned other performers did not act so well as themselves yes replied the master of the house selfpraise is always to be believed yet i have known a signpainter criticize upon raphael wit will be often entertaining but a small portion of ones own if we had it is better than a cartload of other peoples yet quotations from the drama may show some judgment when properly applied and not too often the author of a comedy called the plays the plot shows the strolling players not improperly by their style  it is something surprising to me that where vice in every shape with folly is exposed daily to their view performers on the stage should have any faults or at least art enough to disguise them so well that few should find them out to hide the passions nature has sown in the seeds of the human race will prevent their growth and in time destroy them may we not learn virtue and avoid vice by the instructive lessons of the drama what premeditated murderer would not feel compunction or perhaps repentance at the speech of torrismond to the queen in the spanish friar when she has given commission to the murder of the good king sancho  think timely think on the last dreadful day how will you tremble there to stand exposed and foremost in the rank of guilty ghosts that must be doomed for murder think on murder that troop is placed apart from common crimes the damned themselves start wide and shun that band as far more black and more forlorn than they the queens answer  it is terrible it shakes it staggers me i knew this truth but i repelled the thought sure there is none but fears a future state and when the most obdurate swear they do not their trembling hearts belie their boasting tongues we may find by this last speech the former had its desired effect since the queen repented her impious intentions  in rule a wife we have another upon the crying sin of adultery which i shall set down as another memento  the duke of modena tries all his arts to debauch margarita the wife of leon a woman of a vicious inclination who consented to marry leon merely as a tool that she might indulge her passions but by the spirit and conduct of her husband was reclaimed when the duke by the appointment of the worthy leon permits their meeting after a ridiculous fright from a drunkard in the cellar which the duke takes for a spirit he cries  o i am most miserable margarita the wife answers  you are indeed and like a foolish thing have made yourself so could not your own discretion tell ye sir when i was married i was none of yours your eyes were then commanded to look off me and i now stand in a circle and secure mark me but this and then sir be most miserable it is sacrilege to violate a wedlock you rob two temples make yourself twice guilty you ruin here is and spot her noble husbands we might go through the sacred decalogue with the assistance of those flowers in the spacious fields of poetry  the stage says the female spectator by its institution is the school of virtue and the scourge of vice and when either of these noble purposes is defeated it is no wonder that persons of true sense and honor choose to absent themselves and oblige their families to do so too so reasonable an entertainment as the drama in its purity must be in some sort a promoter to virtue therefore every manager of a theater should make it his study to exhibit no other pieces but what aim to that end and by degrees throw off the looser drama and constitute in its place those that the wisest and most virtuous need not be ashamed to partake of the innocent amusement i do not pretend to set up for a monitor but every stage performer would find his account in reforming the stage as well as themselves i do not mean this admonition to any particular theater but all in general at home and abroad for our plantations in america have been voluntarily visited by some itinerants jamaica in particular i had an account from a gentleman who was possessed of a large estate in the island that a company in the year      came there and cleared a large sum of money where they might have made moderate fortunes if they had not been too busy with the growth of the country they received   0 pistoles the first night to the beggars opera but within the space of two months they buried their third polly and two of their men the gentlemen of the island for some time took their turns upon the stage to keep up the diversion but this did not hold long for in two months more there were but one old man a boy and a woman of the company left the rest died either with the countrydistemper the country distempers are the drygripes and tenesmus which generally ends in a sanguinary flux most newcomers for want of a proper regimen fall into it the drygripes brings a final dissolution in two days if no remedy keeps it back the other distemper indeed is slower in its execution and cure sir hans sloane tells us the badness of the water contributed to all these distempers which is brackish near the seacoasts but swallowing large draughts of rum punch with the fatal dew that falls in the night when the body is carelessly exposed heated with drinking is the chief cause place any woollen garment exposed to the noxious vapors of the night and it will imbibe double its weight of dew before sunrise those that escape the seasoning as they term it seldom feel the fatal effects of it afterward this is more dangerous on the seacoasts of the island the mid parts are much more salubrious both as to air and water  or the common beverage of the place the noble spirit of rumpunch which is generally fatal to newcomers the shattered remains with upwards of  000 pistoles in bank embarked for carolina to join another company at charlestown but were cast away in the voyage had the company been more blessed with the virtue of sobriety etc they might perhaps have lived to carry home the liberality of those generous islanders  even the wicked have some regard to virtue are often awed by persons that are reputed to wear that amiable character persons on the stage which is too liable to insults escape them there unless as in a crowd of quarrellers where a looker on may meet with an accidental stroke but these theatrical squabbles are too often ungenerous from the audience or i should say from a small part of the audience for a dozen when they are pleased to take it into their heads shall disturb the whole and disconcert the best actors in the world is not this a gross affront upon the rest what right have i to rob my neighbor of his money and satisfaction he pays the price to be entertained for two or three hours and perhaps would be as well contented with a wellacted play as a dinner now if i should come to you sir be you who you will while you are sat down to your meal at a tavern turn the drawers down stairs throw your provision about prevent your eating your dinner with any satisfaction i should think you a very goodnatured gentleman if you only thrust me out of your room because i should imagine i deserved worse treatment  i remember above twenty years past i was one of the audience at a new play before me sat a seaofficer with whom i had some acquaintance on each hand of him a couple of sparks both prepared with their offensive instruments vulgarly termed catcalls which they were often tuning before the play began the officer did not take any notice of them till the curtain drew up but when they continued their sowgelders music as he unpolitely called it he begged they would not prevent his hearing the actors though they might not care whether they heard or no but they took little notice of his civil request which he repeated again and again to no purpose but at last one of them condescended to tell him if he did not like it he might let it alone why really replied the sailor i do not like it and would have you let your noise alone i have paid my money to see and hear the play and your ridiculous noise not only hinders me but a great many other people that are here i believe with the same design now if you prevent us you rob us of our money and our time therefore i entreat you as you look like gentlemen to behave as such one of them seemed mollified and put his whistle in his pocket but the other was incorrigible the blunt tar made him one speech more sir said he i advise you once more to follow the example of this gentleman and put up your pipe but the piper sneerd in his face and clapped his troublesome instrument to his mouth with cheeks swelled out like a trumpeter to give it a redoubled and louder noise but like the broken crow of a cock in a fright the squeak was stopped in the middle by a blow from the officer which he gave him with so strong a will that his childs trumpet was struck through his cheek and his companion led him out to a surgeon so that we had more room and less noise and not one that saw or heard the affair but what were well pleased with his treatment and notwithstanding his great blustering he never thought it worth his while to call upon the officer though he knew where to find him it is certainly a mark of cowardice to insult in public company or strike a man who has his hands bound and yet i have known a poor actor pelted by puppies that would run away at the sight of a stagefoil that has neither edge or point  as cheats to play with those still aim that do not understand the game so cowards never use their might but against those that must not fight hud actors in france meet with respect i mean if they will endeavor to deserve it which in my opinion they may easily do and are acceptable in the company of rank and figure in that polite nation and though the clergy scrupled to give moliere moliere the great comic poet of france was esteemed an excellent actor he died in performing the part of the hypochondriac in a comedy of his own writeing called le malade imaginaire which is part of a comedy in english called the motherinlaw on the   th of february      in his grand climacteric the archbishop of paris would not allow his body to be inhumd in consecrated ground which the king being informed of sent for the archbishop and expostulated with him but he was an obstinate churchman and would not willingly condescend to his majestys persuasions the king finding him unwilling to comply desired to know how many feet deep the holy ground reached the bishop replied about eight well replied the king i find there is no getting the better of your scruples therefore let his grave be dug twelve feet that is four below your consecrated ground and let them bury him there the archbishop was obliged to comply for lewis the xivth would be obeyed moliere left behind him thirtytwo dramatic pieces which are held by the french in the highest esteem a french gentleman in giving me his opinion of this excellent author told me moliere composed    pieces for the stage and though he had left the world twice that number of years all the dramatic writers of the french nation had not produced twice as many comedies equal to his most of his comedies have given a foundation to our english dramatic writers but none have met with more success than the miser and the mockdoctor by mr fielding the rites of the church at his death yet lewis the xivth often conversed with him in his closet as well as in public  i shall not say much more on this subject and it may be i have said too much already for i am convinced nil sub sole novum no not even in fashions for what we receive for new are only the old ones taking their course over again the stage is the epitome of the great world as boileau has said long ago  le monde a mon avis est comme une grand theater etc the world in my opinion is a stage where in deceiving others all engage hence the discerning eye can often scan the player widely differing from the man the blockhead prating from anothers book the scholar apes with supercilious look and the sly knave by putting virtue on deceives the virtuous till they are undone it is very possible boileau might have shakespeare in view in these lines from that of antonios speech in the first act of the merchant of venice i hold this world but as a world gratiano a stage where every man must play his part etc the french have borrowed from us as well as we have from them le comte d essex is not only planned upon bankss earl of essex but has many speeches for several pages together translated the best modern tragic poet france has produced since corneille and racine monsieur this noted author about twenty years past resided in london his acquaintance with the laureat brought him frequently to the theater where he confessed he improved in the english orthography more in a week than he should otherwise have done by labored study in a month i furnished him every evening with the play of the night which he took with him into the orchestre his accustomed seat in four or five months he not only conversed in elegant english but wrote it with exact propriety in time he wore off the prejudice he first conceived at the catastrophe of our english tragedy the custom of killing upon the stage never having been introduced on the french theater till the zara of this author which he planned from shakespeares othello the last speech of osmin the emperor after he has stabbed zara which he ends by killing himself is to the same purpose with othellos and the same sentiments his attempt answered his wish for zaire in paris had above fifty successive crowded audiences the french opened their senses to the true fire of our english drama where they discovered the spirit of liberty and for the first time showed that monarchs had no right from heaven to enslave their subjects and that godlike liberty was a gift from power almighty the freedom of his pen gave disgust to people in power and their resentment occasioned his banishment from paris shortly after he made himself a voluntary exile where his wit gains him many admirers and his good sense and wisdom links them in the lands of friendship voltaire has in oedipus followed our english play of that name and ends his third act with a verbal translation from not lee  to you just gods i make my last appeal or clear my virtues or my crimes reveal etc his zaire looks after othello in its jealousy and all the rest of his plays seem to be of english extraction  now let us leave greece rome france britain and the rest of the world and retire to this kingdom where no snake in the grass will rise to bite the unwary traveller no blindworm or adder to hiss us into fears viper or toad to molest our eyes or noisome spider to spread her venom which according to some of the ancient irish bards were banished the island many ages before st patric the irish history informs us that prince gadelus i think of the milesian race in his travels visited pharaoh king of egypt fell in love with scota the kings daughter and married her this gadelus or gadel for the royal records of tarah call him by both names as i am informed in egypt was stung by a serpent as he lay asleep and was healed by the prophet moses the irish is thus elegantly translated by a native bard  the hissing serpent eager for his prey ascends the couch where sleeping gadel lay in winding mazes there himself he rolled and leaped upon him with a dreadful fold and sheek his forked tongue and then around his neck he twists and gave a deadly wound the subtle poison spreads through every vein no art no juice of herbs can ease the pain till moses with his neverfailing wand touched the raw wound which healed at his command when gadelus with his wife scota from this princess ireland was first called scota and his followers were leaving egypt to settle some new colony the following prophecy was declared by moses translated by the same elegant hand  the holy prophet was inspired to see into events of dark futurity and said for thee young prince has heaven in store blessings that mortals never enjoyed before for wheresoeer the royal line shall come fruitful shall be their land and safe their home no poisonous snake or serpent shall deface the beauty of thy fields or taint thy grass no noisome reptile with envenomed teeth shall ever swell that land or be the cause of death but innocence and arts shall flourish there and learning in its lovely shapes appear the poets there shall in their songs proclaim thy glorious acts and neverdying name our english historians mention the bards of ancient britain but we cannot find any of their productions extant when we are assured there are many irish historians and poets still to be found in ireland as well as england more especially in the library of the duke of chandos preserved even from the depredations of the danes destroyers that were utter enemies to science and learning     this kingdom of ireland is one of the last in europe where established theaters were erected yet i am assured one of the first whose bards or poets have celebrated in verse the illustrious actions of their monarchs nor any nation in the world where poetry and poets were in such high esteem every ancient and noble family had one in their household and their kings their poet laureats as we have in england but long long before the english invaded ireland the poets had their seats in their great assembled triennial councils which you may find by the following lines translated from the original irish by the same hand  once in three years the great convention sat and for the public happiness debate the king was seated on a royal throne and on his face majestic greatness shone a monarch for heroic deeds designed for noble acts become a noble mind around him summoned by his strict command the peers the priests and commons of the land the bards or poets are indulged a place and men of learning the assembly grace here love and union every look confessed and joy and friendship beat in every breast justice by nothing biased or inclined is deaf to pity to temptation blind for here with stern and steady rule she sways and flagrant crimes with certain vengeance pays though just yet so indulgently severe like heaven she pities those she cannot spare a few lines more of the same author and same translator will tell you the poet laureats business at court for he was one of the ten officers that attended the kings of ireland  a poet to applaud or boldly blame and justly to give infamy or fame for without him the freshest laurels fade and vice to dark oblivion is betrayed by these lines we may gather that their poets were their historians and it may be supposed if they had thought of the drama we might have had some elegant tragedies handed down to us but to proceed  mr ogilby the master of the revels in this kingdom who had it from proper authority informed mr ashbury that plays had been often acted in the castle of dublin when blount lord mountjoy was lord lieutenant here in the latter end of the reign of queen elizabeth and mr ashbury saw a bill for wax tapers dated the   th day of september   0  queen elizabeths birthday for the play of the play of gorboduc was written by the right honorable thomas sackville lord buckhurst afterward created earl of dorset in the first year of king james the firsts reign this dramatic piece was accounted the best of its kind at the time it was wrote it was first published under the title of ferrex and porrex in      and    0 reprinted under the title of gorboduc this was a favorite play of queen elizabeths as may be supposed by her seeing it twice acted first by the gentlemen of the inner temple and afterward by the children of her majestys revels mr spence professor of poetry in the university of oxford has reprinted this play about nine years ago and dedicated it to the earl of middlesex son to his grace the duke of dorset descended from this author gorboduc done at the castle oneandtwenty shillings and two groats but it is to be supposed they were gentlemen of the court that were the actors on this occasion  i cannot find any established theater in dublin till the year      when the earl of strafford was lord lieutenant of this kingdom in the tenth year of the reign of king charles the first john ogilby esquire then master of the revels under the title of historiographer to his majesty and master of the revels in the kingdom of ireland and i believe the first that wore the last title this theater was built by his directions in warbergstreet where the company continued to act till the unhappy rebellion broke out in the year      henry burnel esquire a gentleman of ireland wrote a play called landgartha a tragicomedy acted at the new theater in dublin      with very great applause so says the title but there are no actors names printed in the drama the prologue was spoken by an amazon armed with a battleax to bespeak the favor of the audience the plot is taken from the danish history of saxo grammaticus this play was the last that was performed on the theater in warbergstreet before the rebellion broke out which was discovered by mr owen o connolly but the night before the execution which prevented the city of dublin being seized on the   d of october      as intended but it was too late to give notice to the rest of the kingdom which felt the fatal effect of the rebellion  the theater was then shut up by order of the lords justices signed william parsons and john borlace we do not find any mention of a theater in dublin till the year after the restoration      which was built on the spot where the theater now stands in orangestreet commonly called smockalley how it came by the last name may be easily guessed  we find in the year      pompey a tragedy acted at the theater in dublin translated from the french of corneille it is wrote in verse by mrs catharine phillips the famed orinda termed by her cotemporary poets the english sappho this lady wrote another play called horace taken from the same french author but neither of them played in england till after her death which fell out in the year      in the   st year of her age of the smallpox from this we may gather that she resided in ireland since both her plays were acted in this kingdom some years before they were performed in england  the theater in smockalley was so badly built that in the year      some part of it sell down when two were killed and several sorely maimed we can give little account of the theater here from this time till after the revolution all that can be given will be noted in the life of joseph ashbury esquire playing was discontinued during the troubles between king william and james the second but when quiet peace was restored the theater opened again with othello moor of venice the part of othello by mr wilks see more of this in the memoirs of that excellent player this play was acted by officers mostly about the castle mr ashbury iago only for the company was not formed till three months after when they began again with othello which was on march          the day of proclaiming the end of the irish war the company played on with success many years and i find by the cast of sir george etheridges three comedies there has not been a better in all its branches since which i shall set down in proper order that the reader may

schoolding   distinguished characters in bills were not in fashion at the time these plays were performed they were printed in order according to the drama as they stood not regarding the merit of the actor as for example in macbeth duncan king of scotland appeared first in the bill though acted by an insignificant person and so every other actor appeared according to his dramatic dignity all of the samesizd letter but latterly i can assure my readers i have found it a difficult task to please some ladies as well as gentlemen because i could not find letters large enough to please them and some were so very fond of elbowroom that they would have shoved every body out but themselves as if one person was to do all and have the merit of all like generals of an army such a victory was gained by such a king and such a prince while the other officers and soldiers are forgot but as trim tells us in the funeral or grief alamode  0000 of such rascals as these will make an alexander i shall leave this last quarter of a hundred of years to the memory of others that i may the sooner come to the conclusion of my little history and fall upon the memoirs i have told you the first theater was built in      and the old smockalley house in      and now i shall proceed to the rest as they stand at present  in the year      a theatrical booth was erected by mrs violante an italian lady celebrated for strength and agility a qualification that does not render the fairsex the least more amiable the strength of the limbs which these sort of undertakers expose in my opinion is shockingly indecent but hers were masculinely indelicate and were of a piece with the features of her face i am informed the showing her limbs did not meet with the success in this kingdom as she had found in her elder sister england that ladys children delight in such entertainments bullbaiting boxing beargarden and prizefighting will draw to them all ranks of people from the peer to the pedlar our late english gladiator mr figg of cuttingslashing memory made much private emolument by his public valor more especially in linen mr figg informed me once that he had not bought a shirt for more than twenty years but had sold some dozens it was his method when he fought in his amphitheatre his stage bearing that superb title he sent round to a select number of his scholars to borrow a shirt for the ensuing combat and seldom failed of half a dozen of superfine holland from his prime pupils most of the young nobility and gentry made it part of their education to march under his warlike banner this champion was generally conqueror though his shirt seldom failed of gaining a cut from his enemy and sometimes his flesh though i think he never received any dangerous wound most of his scholars were at every battle and were sure to exult at their great masters victories every person supposing he saw the wounds his shirt received mr figg took his opportunity to inform his lenders of linen of the chasms their shirts received with a promise to send them home but said the ingenious courageous figg i seldom received any other answer than damn you keep it i shall not enter into the merits of this method in procuring linen but if it was a fraud as he told me he was never found guilty for as hudibras says for those that meddle with his tools will cut their fingers if they are fools    but to mademoiselle violante she finding her tumbling tiresome fell into playing and pantomime another disgrace to the drama mr barrington mr john morris and i think mr beamsly miss woffington miss mackay now mrs mitchel and many others came under her directions and played several dramatic pieces with grotesque entertainments till stopped by the lord mayor of the city of dublin mrs violante having no sanction or proper authority to exhibit such entertainments the it is now an hospital for indigent lyingin women which is a generous virtuous and humane charity worthy the imitation of every civilized nation the director and inventor of this useful institution ought to be mentioned with great respect how many subjects have been lost for want of such a noble charity the hospital was opened in march      and by the first of november      there were     poor women safely delivered of     boys and     girls    women bearing twins the eminent dr moss the first promoter of this charitable work giving attendance without fee or reward i wish iberias elder sister would follow the example it is true there are such in china but not under such regulation the women there are not received till the pangs of childbirth attack them according to mendez pinto and several mothers with their infants perish before they can be conveyed to the hospital in paris there is one of this kind but the women after the month if able are obliged to attend those that lie in and cannot be free of the place till their turn comes on which must be one month at least for as i am informed they are nurses to each other rome that has hospitals almost without number has none such though they have one for repenting courtezans although the hospitals in amsterdam maintain  0000 souls of both sexes yet i cannot find one that is appropriated to this use place is put to another use  i shall take leave of violante and her postures and give it as my own opinion that i think such diversions are below the dignity of the stage or humanity where can be the satisfaction when death and danger attend it i have the fate of lady isabella the lady isabella was born in italy sprung from a noble family in the city of florence she was put into a nunnery at twelve years of age in order to take the veil but a posturemaster unluckily came to that city gained her affections and found means to carry her off and married her instructed her in his unseemly dangerous employment if we may call it so and brought her to england where lady isabella was greatly admired for her postures and feats of activity the last and fatal time of her performance she was eight months gone with child but the covetous husband loved money so well as it is reported that he would not allow her the necessary repose required in her condition so that in one of her dances on a slack rope she fell on the stage where the mother and infant newly born with the force of the fall expired in a moment fatal catastrophe in the twentyfirst year of her age this was the running account of the poor lady isabella after her death whose end was much lamented for notwithstanding her disreputable employment she was esteemed as a woman of strict virtue ever present to my memory at the mentioning of such dangerous entertainments i should have told my reader that mrs violante had let her booth to mr luke sparks mr john barrington miss mackay now mrs mitchel for three pounds per week the three mentioned persons being all very young fell desperately in love with the dramatic poets and were resolved to marry them with their poetical fortune that is without a rag to cover their nakedness or rather nothing but rags for their scenes had showed their best days however clothes were borrowed some from friends and some to be paid for and they began with a comedy of farquhars called the inconstant or the way to win him the three chief parts being performed by the three adventurous undertakers viz  young mirabel by mr sparks duretete by mr barrington bisarre by miss mackay   mr sparks as having played before in a country company was the manager the play was performed much better than was expected and their company soon became more numerous being joined by others that looked more to profit than pleasure for these three lovers of the drama could play heroes and heroines without eating love for the sublime was enough for them however other people did not relish this cameleon diet and hungerd after something more substantial therefore resolved upon benefits and gave the first to miss mackay in order to break the ice the fops fortune was the play and she then being a young promising actress several ladies of the first rank espoused her cause and brought upwards of forty pounds to her benefit they might well say with the herald in the rehearsal they had not seen so much the lord knows when the success of this benefit alarmed the old smockalley house who applying to the lord mayor he sent orders to forbid their acting and it was with much difficulty they had leave to play one more which was womans a riddle to a good house and that the last this was the spring from whence ransfordstreet arose out of the power of the lord mayor of dublin  ransfordstreet theater was built and opened for the first time under a license granted by the right honorable the earl of mead i saw a license granted by that worthy nobleman to the late mr thomas walker comedian for forty pounds per annum which sum was meant to be given to the poor in the earl of meaths liberty a pious example  being part of his liberties the first play that was performed there was a comedy called  love for love husband sir sampson by mr moore since dead valentine by mr husband tattle by mr ravenscroft since dead foresight by mr bourne now in england ben by mr sparks trapland by mr daniel jeremy by mr roch   angelica by mrs ravenscroft dead mrs foresight by mrs smith dead mrs frail by miss mackay now mrs mitchel miss prue by miss barnes now mrs martin nurse by mrs talent lives at cork  i never saw this theater but have been informed it was a very neat compact building capable of containing an hundred pounds at common prices which they never raised but at benefits  the company performed here above a year with tolerable success sometimes neap and sometimes springtides but when henry the eighth with the pompous coronation was exhibited at the theater in aungierstreet they were almost forsaken good sense with show for once prevailed which is not always the case  as poverty is the mother of invention all the wit of the company went to work and at last produced a mock coronation with less expense than a ladys tail at aungierstreet theater it was called the beggars coronation and not unworthy that title in the play of the royal merchant or the beggars bush with the following prologue on the solemn occasion ushered in by this preamble in print  aprologue spoke at ransfordstreet playhouse on the revival of the royal merchant or the beggars bush which was acted with the mock coronation on the playing king henry the viiith and coronation in aungierstreet playhouse  well by this time your eyes have achd with gazing on coronations masks and sights no less amazing here then you come unwilling to be pleased longer than just your dazzled sight is eased the sun it is true will dim the strongest eye and darkness only can new force supply  yet you must own that had no show been there you would been content to kill an evening here the coronation made so great a noise had there been none harry had missed your voice buffoon  jackpudding  jobson  hob conspired in vain to make the burlesque king admired he played it though some say with wondrous art his belly  shook and  that was all the part yet faith it is odd  but we surprise you more than harrys hoh or wolseys envied store here honest clause shall gain a beggars crown though tyrants threaten and proud churchmen frown each willing subject his small tribute brings abhorring slavery yet adoring kings clause though a beggar midst his rags is free henrys a slave to tyrants great as he how does their splendour mock their wretched fate they mourn in pomp and starve in pageant state like petty kings who romes subjection own to feed its pride they hunger on a throne if any here with indigested rage will speak malignly of our sporting stage as if in ridicule of rites so known sacred to britains fame and georges crown we thus our mockery of state pursue let others our design with candor view and own if any disrespect appears it is them we mock be then the censure theirs as the world is fond of novelty and this mock coronation appearing new the stream of success flowed upon them with a rapid torrent swelled their pockets till they overflowed their banks and watered the fields of many a publican debts were cleared and every single person might fearless look at the dial on the tholsel  their success went even beyond their hopes and aungierstreet suffered short allowance as they say at sea because the current was turned another way yet i find by this success all do not think alike  king henry the eighth with the coronation in the utmost magnificence was performed in the year of his present majestys accession to the throne at the theater royal in drurylane london the success there was beyond the bounds of expectation it was even added to every play as a pantomime etc and exhibited that one season    times  the theater in lincolns end fields got up a mock coronation as a burlesque upon that in drury lane but the audience took a different turn to that in ransfordstreet for the poor mock peers and magistrates were pelted off the stage in the utmost contempt and all their study and labor came to nothing  however this mock coronation filled ransfordstreet theater seventeen succeeding nights but as mountainrivers soon overflow they as soon sink and rest in their natural bed again ransfordstreet was too far out of the way therefore the company after three years occupation forsook it however i shall subjoin a couple of poetical pieces of poetry occasioned by the above prologue wits are a tribe like jews and one production begets another as every line of battle ship has its own chaplain so every theater have their own poets and sometimes like ragotin in scarron they may be found in itinerant troops the opponent theater produced one spoken by mrs bellamy in boys clothes at a time when an epidemic cold had reigned greatly in town  dear ladies may i perish but i am proud to find you all recovered and so loud not one sore throat amongst you now remains of that vile cold of which the town complains and faith you will answer for me i am sincere when i profess i am glad to see you here i found a female habit would not do and therefore tried a pair of breeches too a spruce young blade well made with such address among you belles may speak with some success  and i who am a woman  to my cost know by myself what please the ladies most  in vain we strive our merit here to show for every night to ransfordstreet you go where painted scenes and tinselld taudry dress are only splendid signs of emptiness but this is scandal for all dublin knows that playhouse deals not overmuch in clothes two venders of the same commodity will be a little too apt to depreciate each others goods therefore the poet drew his pen in their defense and furnished forth the following prologue spoke by miss mackay in the character of lady townley in the provoked husband  as some poor squire to country quarters sent his credit gone and all his money spent a swarm of duns each morn attend his door crying out money faith we are very poor why ay the squire replies but pray have patience six months arrears comes with my next acquittance just so i have told my duns this many a day they would all have money when i got my play this play was for miss mackays benefit  the other house we thank their honest care have to their cost engaged the good lord mayor to send us as they thought  the lord knows where yet well forgive them if they keep their word but that is more than they can yet afford it is true alas we are scant in clothes while they abound in more  than they can ever pay  our house is new  thanks to our benefactors old smockalley was then in a ruinous condition  nor do we envy those enslaved detractors they may get one but lord knows where get actors aungierstrect was afterward built for the company in smockalley  we may see this last bard did not take the least advantage of his antagonist their lines were exactly even and eighteen thrusts given on each side and therefore neither could claim the conquest though like battles in flanders each side claimed the victory and each general put on the wreath of conqueror  the theater in aungierstreet was built by the voluntary subscription of many of the illustrious nobility and gentry of the kingdom the first stone was laid by the duke of dorset then lord lieutenant but i think the architect had more view to the magnificent than theatrical the audience part is ornamented with rich embellishment that gives it a superb countenance but no disparagement to the architect in other buildings this might have been more convenient with less cost but i believe the contriver had an eye more to ridottos than the drama if so indeed his intentions were answered for in that shape it may vie with that in the haymarket in london thrusting my own opinion in this manner might have the air of presumption if my employment and observation had not taken up full thirty years of my time in other buildings i would not pretend to give my judgment on a pigeonhouse or a centrybox or give directions in erecting a thatched cabin or a turnpike  aungierstreet theater opened march the  th       with the comedy of the recruiting officer the parts acted as follows captain plume by mr j elrington justice balance by mr layfield captain brazen by mr r elrington worthy by mr watson kite by mr vanderbank bullock by mr f elrington since dead  st recruit by mr reed now in his majestys navy  d recruit by mr butler died in england    silvia by mrs bellamy melinda by mrs wrightson lucy by mrs reynolds rose by mrs moreau these were the main body of the theatrical army in its first march though several auxiliaries joined them afterward  the theater in smockalley the proper name is orangestreet but it took the appellation of smockalley from mother bungy of infamous memory and was in her days a sink of sin but a man being found murdered in these bottomless pits of wickedness the sheds were pulled down by the populace the unclean vermin were banished the place purged of its infamy handsome dwellings now show their faces in a modest garb and entertain modest and reputable inhabitants and therefore i think ought to lose its old stained name but if tyburn were removed the spot would be called tyburn still was built by a voluntary subscription the architect has considered the building more for the real intention of the proprietors i mean for profit the cavea or that part where the audience sit is much more convenient than that of aungierstreet and will contain a fifth part more in number than the latter although it does not appear so to the eye on the contrary the stage is more cramped for want of room which might have been otherwise at the first building  when i came first from england in the year      i brought over an experienced machinist who altered the stage after the manner of the theaters in france and england and formed a machine to move the scenes regularly all together but it is since laid aside as well as the flies above which were made as convenient as the theater would admit however the present manager has formed it as regular and convenient as the spot would allow of decorated it with all the elegance of the theaters abroad with proper scenery and habits that her elder sisters in england need not blush at the figure she makes  this new theater opened with a comedy called love makes a man or the fops fortune  the parts played as follows  don antonio by mr dash don charino by mr bourne carlos by mr ward don lewis by mr wetherilt don duart by mr cashel clody by mr sparks governor by mr redman sancho by mr barrington   elvira by miss boucher lovisa by mrs ward angelina by miss barnes now martin    but so eager were they to open or to get money that they began to play before the backpart of the house was tild in which the town knowing they had not half an audience the first night but mended leisurely by degrees where we shall leave them on the mending hand and walk to  capelstreet this theater was built like an aggrieved people in the state of rebellion their forces raised in a hurry neither well clothed armed or paid their fortifications so slightly thrown up did not promise a long defense though they had a veteran at their head that might have taught them discipline had he taken proper pains with his raw soldiers or rather indeed had they been more capable of being taught but this hasty building was erected in the great cause of liberty  the love of liberty with life is given and life itselfs the inferior gift of heaven this company opened under the sanction of the lord mayor of dublin and called themselves the city company of comedians their first play was shakespeares merchant of venice  duke by mr rivers morochius by mr brouden antonio by mr townsend bassanio by mr marshal gratiano by mr hall lorenzo by mr corry shylock by mr wright tubal by mr bourne lancelot by mr morgan   portia by mrs brouden nerissa by mrs phillips jessica by miss lewis   i shall leave the further mention of this theater to the memoirs of the worthy projector of it harlequin phillips and end with its neighbor  punchs theater o happy manager whose servants never disoblige or contradict his will no clamouring for parts or pay no envy reigns among them no sycophants to corrupt his ears with falsehoods or cringing flatterers to tickle his vices or swell his pride and vanity but all obey him without selfinterest or ever trouble themselves whether they are naked or clothed or ever repine at the success of each others performance or like the spaniards a spanish bishop writes thus of the conquest of america the first conquerors of this large new world gave out that there were mighty giants and warlike amazons all of them a race of cannibals that fed upon human flesh making war on each other for that purpose but these reports were spread to cover the inhumanity of the spaniards who put to death with extreme tortures above six millions of innocent naked harmless indians pretending it was in the service of heaven to rob starve and murder the image of their creator when it has been proved their own avarice was the motive when millions were put to death a thousand ways because they could not or would not discover their hidden wealth  thus it too often falls out among ourselves when a poor wretch is halfladen with injuries they make up the other halfburden with falsehoods and very humanly throw on a weight that entirely sinks him    lay faults on the indians to cover their own cruelty mr punchs theater has been built and occupyd by these decent and wellbehavd performers several years it goes by the name of the first founder stretch as the coffeehouses in london still go by the names of toms whites and wills though the names of their present masters may be jack sam or ned however it intimates that the first were eminent in their stations and it expresses modesty in the survivors in owning it by continuing their names rather than their own  thus has this opulent city of dublin every innocent diversion that may unbend the mind equal to any city of europe leaving the italian opera out which can neither produce mirth or sorrow pity or compassion yet here is music in perfection converted to a better use than in britain which produces a double pleasure  the charms of harmony and the means to relieve the poor  i have been in most parts of the world in my youth and in every place of note i have touched at as the sailors term it have found the natives of this kingdom in places of trust and power venerated and esteemed by all i shall therefore conclude with two lines of that celebrated french author monsieur voltaire i have mentioned this author in another part of the work as an exile but have learned since that his banishment is repealed and he is made historiographer to the french king   peuple malheureux doux genereux et vaillant en tous lieux exiles mais par tout triomphant illfated race brave generous and true though exiles in each clime through all subdue memoirs of the principal performers on the stage joseph ashbury esquire this worthy gentleman was born in london the year      of an ancient family his father married a near relation of that great scholar and soldier sir walter raleigh who was first gentleman to that duke of buckingham that was killed by lieutenant felton in the reign of king charles the first the gentleman i am about to give an account of was sent very young to the school of eton was founded by that unfortunate king henry the sixth eminent to a degree for producing men of great learning it is seated on the delightful river of thomas in buckinghamshire over against windsor in berkshire it is called etoncollege the chapel is a handsome gothic pile with an organ and choir this place is ranked as the first free school in the kings dominions it seems by art and nature formed for study its shady walks public or private large gardens orchards groves and the limpid river are natural calls for learning etonschool near windsor where he received a genteel education being very well instructed in classical learning after the death of his father his friends procured him a pair of colors in the army under the duke of ormond which was the first time of his coming into this kingdom in the last year of oliver cromwells administration  mr ashbury was one of the number of officers that seized the castle of dublin when governor jones was made prisoner and secured in behalf of king charles ii he was made lieutenant of foot of a company granted by that monarch to the city of dublin in the year    0 and      the duke of ormond the then lord lieutenant made him one of the gentlemen of his retinue and deputymaster of the revels under john ogilby esquire some time after  in the year      at the death of the master of the revels through mr ashburys interest with the duke of ormond he was made patentee and master of the revels in this kingdom his first wife was sister to an eminent actor of that time mr richards by whom he had two children who died in their infancy and the mother of them being a very infirm woman was not long after the death of her second child before she left the world  mr ashbury continued a widower many years till fixing his eyes upon miss darling a blooming young gentlewoman daughter to the reverend mr darling dean of emly by this lady he had two sons the eldest mr boil ashbury lieutenant in brigadier bors regiment and unfortunately killed in a duel at sligoe where he was then on duty june the  th      the last of the male race mr richard ashbury is deputy athlone pursuivant and an eminent undertaker in capelstreet the first part of this account i gathered from mr joseph ashbury s own mouth when i was a young man under his directions in this kingdom about four years before his death when he lived at the bowlinggreenhouse oxmantown since built upon then i believe the finest spot of its kind in the whole universe  his only daughter was married to mr thomas elrington  mr ashbury was not only the principal actor in his time but the best teacher of the rudiments of that science in the three kingdoms i speak not from my own judgment but that of many others as mr wilks mr booth mr keen etc to prove this give me leave to insert a letter from mr wilks to mr ashbury concerning mr william wilks his nephew i was favored with this letter by mr richard ashbury the son   to joseph ashbury esquire master of the revels dublin i have no pretense to ask a favor of mr ashbury but that he has a thousand times obliged me i take the liberty therefore to recommend the bearer my nephew mr william wilks the nephew mentioned in this letter came over here and played several parts in the old smockalley theater and though young and genteel he was only the shadow of his uncle and his name befriended him more than his abilities he returned to england after a years probation here and was entered one of the company in drury lane at thirty shillings a week and died before he had reached his  0th year or a higher salary he was a good scholar and had a tolerable knack of rhyming to his phyllis  to you for your countenance and favor he was bred an attorney but is unhappily fallen in love with that fickle mistress the stage and no arguments can dissuade him from it i have refused to give him any countenance in hopes that time and experience might cure him but since i find him determined to make an attempt somewhere no one i am sure is able to give him so just a notion of the business as mr ashbury and indeed i am proud to own that all the success i have met with both with you and in england on the stage has been entirely owing to the early impressions i received from you  if you find that my nephew wants either genius or any other necessary qualification i beg dear sir that you will freely tell him his disabilities and then it is possible he may more easily be persuaded to return to his friends and business which i am informed he understands perfectly well  before i had the favor of yours honest jo trefusis mr joseph trefusis was the original trapland in love for love and a wellesteemd low comedian a theatrical term to distinguish that branch from the genteel and was famous for dancing an awkward country clown he was an experienced angler as he was fishing by the liffy side some friends of his were going in a boat in order to embark for england

companions to make the journey to london with them with his fishingcloaths upon his back not a second shirt and but seven shillings in his pocket his companions left him at london and mr wilks found him gazing at the dial in the square of covent garden he hardly knew him at first as mr wilks told me but by his particular gait which was beyond imitation when he asked him how he came there and in that pickle hum ha why faith bobby replied jo i only came from dublin to see what it was oclock at covent garden however mr wilks newcloathd him supplied him with money and sent him back as mentioned in the above letter before he received mr ashburys letter to supply him  i believe was near his journeys end and i had taken care to furnish him with what was necessary for which i neither expect or desire any return it is sufficient that you esteem it a kindness and i wish it were in my power to lay a more lasting obligation upon mr ashbury or any of his family my most humble service to the dearest part of you  in plain terms  your wife  to mr elrington and his fanny  and pray believe that i shall be ready on all occasions to show how much i am dear sir your obliged and faithful humble servant  robert wilks london dec         when the earl of wharton was lord lieutenant some needy courtier tried all his interest to be made master of the revels insomuch that mr ashbury was greatly alarmed at it which was said to proceed from a report of his death therefore in the   th year of his age he embarked for england to solicit the queen  he arrived at chester from whence he sent the following letter to his wife concerning the affair  i received this from the same hand with the other chester october         my dear this is only to let you know that i am safely arrived at chester where i had the good fortune to meet with sir john stanley who was well pleased to see me after i had told him the cause of my journey relating to my patent he bid me be assured he would render me all the good offices in his power and was of the opinion it lay in the will of the duke of shrewsbury our good lord lieutenant without giving our gracious queen the least trouble concerning it this morning i had the honor of a visit from mr kightly and sir richard levinze who are of the same opinlon with sir john and have both promised me their utmost assistance good mr kightly tells me he will put her majesty in mind of her old master mr ashbury taught the queen when she was princess anne the part of semandra in mithridates king of pontus which was acted at court by persons of the first rank in the banqueting house whitehall where mr ashbury was prompter and conducted the whole  as he was pleased to call me i am so well satisfied in the affair that i would return to thee on the first opportunity if i had not resolved to see my sister and my son tom elringtons father and mother thou know it is troublesome to me to write but to satisfy thee in thy longing desire to hear from me i take the trouble with pleasure i remain thine for ever  joseph ashbury my blessing to all my dear children  mr ashbury suceeded mr darling as steward of the kingsinns a post of good profit i had not the pleasure of knowing this great man but till the latter part of his life yet notwithstanding his great age i have seen him perform several parts with the utmost satisfaction and though at his years it could not be expected the fire of youth and vigor should blaze out yet truth and nature might be seen in a just light his person was of an advantageous height wellproportioned and manly and notwithstanding his great age erect a countenance that demanded a reverential awe a full and meaning eye piercing though not in its full luster and yet i have seen him read letters and printed books without any assistance from art a sweetsounding manly voice without any symptoms of his age in his speech i have seen him acquit himself in the part of careless in the committee so well that his years never struck upon remembrance and his person figure and manner in don quixote were inimitable the use of a short cloak in former fashions on the stage seemed habitual to him and in comedy he seemed to wear it in imagination which often produced action though not ungraceful particular and odd to many of the audience yet in tragedy those actions were left off and every motion manly great and proper  mrs ashbury even in her noontide sun had an amiable person a sweet innocent modest winning countenance and having so great a master in the art was ever just in speech and action without climbing to the summit of perfection yet i have seen her perform one part that seemed a finished original where all since have appeared to me but excellent copies if i may use the term that is mrs pinchwife in wycherlys comedy of the country wife  joseph ashbury esquire died july       0 in the   d year of his age retaining his judgment to the last moment of his life mrs ashbury survived him a few years bewailing his loss till she followed him to the grave this great man was master of the revels to five monarchs of england viz k charles ii k james ii k william q anne and k george the first i shall lead him to his grave with the following poem on his lamented death  as distant thunder in a rolling cloud first murmurs inwardly then roars aloud till the dread clap frights every mortal ear and strikes them with a just and panic fear such was the sad distracted news which bore the tidings to us  ashburys no more the muses speechless to his shrine repair even art and wit stand silent mourners there yet bolder zeal will bands of duty break and gratitude has liberty to speak true passion too can inspiration bring twas grief first taught the nightingale to sing  from his as from some heros awful tomb even my dead muse shall vital warmth resume when first in learning s orb his lustreblazd the world looked up transported and amazed his words as if inspired impression made ulysses skill without his craft displayed his counsels never were varnished over with art with policy he still did truth impart spoke oracles but always spoke his heart by judgments compass every course he steered and watched the signals ere the storm appeared his prudence over the surges did prevail with ballast still proportioned to his sail  precipitately never assumed a trust to promise slow but in performance just by grace instructed and by nature mild nor relished life but when he reconciled his life and aspect did just patterns give what figures we should make and how to live mr antony aston commonly called tony this person was bred an attorney in england but having a smattering of wit and humor he left the study of the law for parts on the stage he strained sorth a comedy which was acted on the theater in smockalley called love in a hurry but with no success he played in all the theaters in london but never continued long in any his way of living was peculiar to himself and family resorting to the principal cities and towns in england with his medley as he called it which consisted of some capital scenes o humor out of the most celebrated plays his company were generally composed of his own family himself his wife and son between every scene a song or dialogue of his own composition filled up the chinks of the slender meal he pretended a right to every town he entered and if a company came to any place where he exhibited his compositions he would use all his art to evacuate the place of these interlopers as he called them he was never out of his way or if he met with a sightly house when he was itinerant he would soon find the name title and circumstances of the family curry them over with his humorous verse and by that means get something to bear his charges to his next station his finances like those of kingdoms were sometimes at the tide of flood and as often at low ebb in one where his stream had left the chanel dry yet ready to launch out on a trading voyage without a cargo or provision he called up his landlord to whom there was something due told him of his losses in his present voyage and being sent for to another place desired he would lend him a small sum upon his wardrobe which he showed him in a large box ten times the value of the debt owing or the sum borrowed the honest landlord seeing a proper security easily complied gave him the sum demanded locked up the trunk put the key in his pocket and retired but as no vessel can make a voyage without sails and other proper materials he had contrived a false bottom to this great box took out the stuffing and by degrees sent off his wardrobe by his emissaries unperceived and that the weight should not detect him he filled up the void with cabbagestalks bricks and stones clothed in rags to prevent moving when the vehicle was to be taken the next morning into the landlords custody every thing succeeded to his wish and away went tony but far wide of the place he mentioned to mine host a week was the stated time of redemption which the landlord saw elapse with infinite satisfaction for he had a bill of sale of the contents in the trunk he opened it with great pleasure but when he saw the fine lining he was motionless like a statue carved by a bungling hand he had recourse to revenge a bailiff with proper directions was sent to the place mentioned but if he had discovered the least wit in his anger he might have thought tony knew better than to tell him truth i only mention this little story to let the reader know the shifts the itinerant gentry are sometimes put to for tony when his finances were in order and cured of the consumption honestly paid him i have had this tale both from tony and the landlord who then kept the blackboy inn at chelmsford in essex  if tony by chance ever came to a town where a company of showmen as people often call them had got in before him he presently declared war with them and his general conditions of peace were that they should act a play for his benefit that he might leave the siege and march with his small troop to some other place and as he was a person of humor and a proper assurance he generally like a cat skimmd off the fat cream and left the lean milk to those that stayed behind i believe he is traveling still and is as well known in every town as the posthorse that carries the mail he shall make his exit with the two following lines  if various dealers the same goods exhibit they wish each other dangling on a gibbet barton booth esquire this excellent tragedian was son to john booth esquire of the county palatine of lancaster a branch of the warrington family he was born in the year      in that county but soon after his birth his father and family removed to westminster and at that celebrated school the son received his education under the correction as he called it of the great dr busby and dr knipe he informed me the first look he cast toward the theater was from the applause he received in performing in the andria of terence in latin at westminsterschool which perverted his thoughts from the pulpit for which his father intended him at seventeen he was chose out for the university and had orders to prepare for his journey but his inclinations prevented the designs of his friends  he first applied to mr betterton then to mr smith two celebrated actors but they decently refused him for fear of the resentment of his family but this did not prevent his pursuing the point in view therefore he resolved for ireland and safely arrived in june school his first rudiments mr ashbury taught him and his first appearance was in the part of oroonoko where he acquitted himself so well to a crowded audience that mr ashbury rewarded him with a present of five guineas which was the more acceptable as his last shilling was reduced to brass as he informed me but an odd accident fell out upon this occasion it being very warm weather in his last scene of the play as he waited to go on he inadvertently wiped his face that when he entered he had the appearance of a chimneysweeper his own words at his entrance he was surprised at the variety of noises he heard in the audience for he knew not what he had done that a little confounded him till he received an extraordinary clap of applause which settled his mind the play was desired for the next night of acting when an actress fitted a crape to his face with an opening proper for the mouth and shaped in form for the nose but in the first scene one part of the crape slipped off and zounds said he he was a little apt to swear i looked like a magpie when i came off they lampblackd me for the rest of the night the composition for blackening the face are ivoryblack and pomatum which is with some pains cleaned with fresh butter  that i was flayed before it could be got off again  he remained here near two years and in that time by letters reconciled himself to his friends in england and returned with great theatrical improvement where he gradually stepped to perfection in   0  he married the daughter of sir wm barkham bart an ancient family in the county of norfolk who died without issue in the year      pyrrhus in the distressed mother placed him in the seat of tragedy and cato fixed him there and to reward his merit he was joined in the patent though great interest was made against him by the other patentees who to prevent his soliciting his patrons at court then at windsor gave out plays every night where mr booth had a principal part notwithstanding this step he had a chariot and six of a noblemans waiting for him at the end of every play that whipped him the twenty miles in three hours and brought him back to the business of the theater the next night he told me not one nobleman in the kingdom had so many sets of horses at command as he had at that time having no less than eight the first set carrying him to hounslow from london ten miles and the next set ready waiting with another chariot to carry him to windsor  he had a vast fund of understanding as well as goodnature and a persuasive elocution even in common discourse that would even compel you to believe him against your judgment of things notwithstanding his exuberance of fancy he was untainted in his morals in his younger years he admired none of the heathen deities so much as jolly bacchus to him he was very devout yet if he drank ever so deep it never marred his study or his stomach but immediately after his marriage with miss santlow whose wise conduct beauty and winning behavior so wrought upon him that home and her company were his chief happiness he entirely contemned the folly of drinking out of season and from one extreme fell i think into the other too suddenly for his appetite for food had no abatement i have often known mrs booth out of extreme tenderness to him order the table to be removed for fear of overcharging his stomach  his profound learning was extraordinary since he left school at seventeen took to the stage at eighteen and by his own confession that the business of the stage joined with his devotion to bacchus had taken up most of his time since yet i have seen him take a classic and render it in such elegant english that no translator would hardly excel i will set down his character from a paper called the prompter by aaron hill esquire whose writings will be a living monument of his own merit  mr booth was a man of a strong clear and lively imagination his conversation was lively and instructive he had the advantage of a finished education to improve and illustrate the bountiful gifts of nature two advantages distinguished him in the strongest light from the rest of the fraternity he had learning to understand perfectly whatever it was his part to speak and judgment to know how far it agreed or disagreed with his character hence arose a peculiar grace which was visible to every spectator though few were at the pains of examining into the cause of their pleasure he could soften or slide over with a kind of elegant negligence the improprieties in a part he acted while on the contrary he would dwell with energy upon the beauties as if he exerted a latent spirit which had been kept back for such an occasion that he might alarm waken and transport in those places only where the dignity of his own good sense could be supported with that of his author a little reflection upon this remarkable quality will teach us to account for that manifest languor which has sometimes been observed in his action and which was generally though i think falsely imputed to the indolence of his temper for the same reason though in the customary round of his business he would condescend to some parts in comedy he seldom appeared in any of them with much advantage to his character the passions which he found in comedy were not strong enough to excite his fire and what seemed want of qualification was only absence of impression he had a talent of discovering the passions where they lay hid in some celebrated parts by the injudicious practice of other actors when he had discovered he soon grew able to express them and his secret for attaining this great lesson of the theater was an adaption of his looks to his voice by which artful imitation of nature the variations in the sound of his words gave propriety to every change in his countenance so that it was booths excellence to be heard and seen the same whether as the pleased the grieved the pitying the reproachful or the angry his gesture or as it is commonly called his action was but the result and necessary consequence of his dominion over his voice and countenance for having by a concurrence of two such causes impressed his imagination with such a stamp and spirit of passion his nerves obeyed the impulse by a kind of natural dependency or relaxed or braced successively into all that fine expressiveness with which he painted what he spoke without restraint or affectation as a proof of mr booths learning i am desired to insert the latin inscription wrote by him on the death of mr smith this gentleman mr smith was zealously attached to the interest of king james the second and served in his army as a volunteer with two servants after the abdication mr smith returned to the theater by the persuasion of many friends and the desire of the town who admired his performance the first character he chose to appear in was that of wilmore in the rover his original part in that comedy but being informed that he should be maltreated on account of his principles he gave orders for the curtain to drop if any disturbance should come from the audience accordingly the play began in the utmost tranquillity but when mr smith entered in the first act the storm began with the usual noise upon such occasions an uproar not unknown to all frequenters of theaters and by time mightily improved by a particular set that delight in that agreeable harmony as pleasing to the ear as a sowgelders horn that sets all the village curs to imitate the sound mr smith gave the signal the curtain dropped and the audience dismissed no persuasions could prevail upon him to appear on the stage again till that great poet mr congreve had wrote his comedy of love for love which was in the year      more than three years void from the above accident this celebrated author prevailed upon several persons of the first rank to move mr smith to appear in the character of scandal in that excellent comedy but he yielded more to the persuasions of his sincere friends mr betterton and mrs barry and accepted the part and his inimitable performance added one grace to the play he took his station in many plays afterward for i think three years he died of a cold occasinod by a violent fit of the cramp for when he was first seized he threw himself out of bed and remained so long before the cramp left him in that naked condition that a cold fell upon his lungs a fever ensued and death released him in three days after the actor with a short account of him as i received it from mr benjamin husband  scenicus eximius regnante carolo secundo bettertono coaetaneus and amicus nec non propemodum aequalis haud ignobile stirpe oriundus nec literarum rudis humaniorum rem scenicam per multos feliciter annos administravit justoque moderamine and morum suavitate omnium intra theatrum observantiam extra theatrum laudem ubique benevolentiam and amorem sibi conciliavit in english an excellent actor flourished in the reign of charles the second bettertons cotemporary and friend and very near him in merit sprung from a genteel family and no stranger to literature in the management of the theater heacquitted himself many years with deserved success and by a just deportment and sweetness of temper gained the respect of all within the theater the applause of those without and everywhere claimed the friendship and affection of mankind i shall give a couple of songs as a specimen of his taste in english poetry among many that do not occur to my memory the source of them both sprung from his growing passion for the amiable miss santlow before their marriage  the first song can then a look create a thought which time can never remove yes foolish heart again you are caught again thou bleedst for love she sees the conquest of her eyes nor heals the wounds she gave she smiles whenever my blushes rise and sighing shuns her slave then swain be bold and still adore her still the flying fair pursue love and friendship still implore her pleading night and day for you the second song i sweet are the charms of her i love more fragrant than the damask rose soft as the down of turtledove gentle as winds when zephyr blows refreshing as descending rains on sunburned climes and thirsty plains ii true as the needle to the pole or as the dial to the sun constant as gliding waters roll whose swelling tides obey the moon from every other charmer free my life and love shall follow thee iii the lamb the flowery thyme devours the dam the tender kid pursues sweet philomel in shady bowers with verdant spring her notes renews all follow what they most admire as i pursue my souls desire iv nature must change her beauteous face and vary as the seasons rise as winter to the spring gives place summer the approach of autumn flies no change on love the seasons bring love only knows perpetual spring v devouring time with stealing pace makes lofty oaks and cedars bow and marble towers and gates of brass in his rude march he levels low but time destroying far and wide love from the soul can never divide vi death only with his cruel dart the gentle godhead can remove and drive him from the bleeding heart to mingle with the blessed above where known to all his kindred train he finds a lasting rest from pain vii love and his sister fair the soul twinborn from heaven together came love will the universe control when dying seasons lose their name divine abodes shall own his power when time and death shall be no more mr w bowen he was born in this kingdom in the year      and played on the irish theater several years he had a loud strong voice which gave him the title of an actor of spirit through the interest of the late duke of ormond he got into the revenue in london he was fiery to a fault and passionate to his prejudice which drew on his own death by the unwilling hands of mr quin mr bowen was too tenacious and could not brook being told that the late ben johnson excelled in the part of jacomo in the libertine though it was given against him by the whole company he immediately parted sent to mr quin in the name of a gentleman to a neighboring tavern when he entered bowen shut the door clapped his back against it and drew his sword mr quin mildly expostulated with him but all to no purpose he threatened to pin him to the wainscot if he did not draw that moment which he did to defend his own life with an intention to disarm him but bowen pressed so furiously upon him that he received the wound which occasioned his death three days after however when the loss of blood had weakened his rage he confessed his own folly and madness had justly drawn on his own misfortune and at the trial mr quin was honorably acquitted mr bowen had several children by his wife and a boy illegitimate who though he bore his name had none of his care and therefore lived a dissolute life without the least improvement from education and justly gained the nickname of ruggedandtough one day a clergyman in st clement danes a church in the strand was catechizing the children of the parish where ruggedandtough thrust among the rest ruggeds dress was none of the cleanest which the good parson observing called him the first to be examined i shall put the short dialogue down just as i had it from an earwitness since the questions are short as well as the answers they will not appear very tedious  parson what is your name   rug ruggedandtough   parson who gave you that name   rug the boys of our alley l  d d  n em for it  the good parson was a little surprised no doubt and ordered him to wait till the rest of the children were examined intending to polish master ruggedandtough but tough not liking to wait so long stole off unperceived all i could learn of mr ruggedandtough afterward was that having a great inclination to travel he contrived means to do it at the charge of the government  thus bad beginning to bad ending tends and vice in nature nature seldom mends  mr john barrington this gentleman was born of a good family in the county of cork he was bred to the law but his stronger genius led him to the drama where he has proved himself one of its favorite children i think his first commencement in the drama was in violantes booth as it was then called in georgeslane he may be well esteemed an excellent comic actor of infinite humor a muchdesird pleasing companion and what is not always to be met with a person of sincerity there is a very ancient family of the barringtons in the county of essex in england where they show a record that their ancestor was instructed in the christian faith by the preaching of st augustine the monk afterward bishop of canterbury and received baptism in the river of thames by that saint in the year of redemption     this account may probably be called a motly one but what of that a good player from the poet may instruct and as an old author writes a verse may find him who a sermon flies and turn delight into a sacrifice   mr spranger barry this gentleman was born in dublin he was married very young and consequently set forward in the world perhaps with too little consideration a lively spirit and good sense are not always prosperous or meet with that success equal to their merit neither does the employment of a father always sit easy upon the son business is not hereditary one may gain a fortune by the same employment that might be lost by the descendent our young gentleman by frequent attendance at the theater turned his genius to the drama inclination and fancy are two good instructors and a willingness to please is doing some part of the work a good person and an excellent voice are great substantives for the stage  the first part he performed in this kingdom was othello the moor of venice to the surprising satisfaction of the general audience he seemed a finished actor dropped from the clouds i hear that in england he has gained the summit of perfection i would say more upon the subject but as he received the first rudiments from me i shall be silent yet borrow a few lines from the poet that may give a remembrance of his person  such beauty as great strength thinks no disgrace smiled in the manly features of his face his tall strait body amidst thousands stood like some fair pine the loftiest of the wood i dont think i can give the reader a greater pleasure upon this occasion than to insert the following letter upon mr barrys first attempt on the stage which may serve for a general instruction to all on the theater  to mr spranger barry from a friend in the country as i lately heard you were determined for the stage my affection for your person and concern for your misfortunes gave occasion to some reflections which may possibly be of use to you in this new scene of life in the time of athenian elegance when learning was in taste when liberty was the blessing of the public and the parent of arts which excellence alone found honor capacity employment and merit rewards the stage grew suddenly from its infancy to maturity and from being encouraged became itself the encourager of those talents and geniuses with which it was supplied it was there that each spectator was taught his particular conduct by seeing his own representation in the general picture of life where the lights were thrown alone upon virtue and the shades upon vice where great and eminent of every age were set up for imitation where every noble tender and exalted sentiment was recorded and daily inculcated where purity was invited obscenity exiled and where the heart was attached to virtue by affectingly walking through all its scenes of misfortunes and lastly exulting in its final reward no institution less than divine could ever be of equal efficacy or advantage for when instruction becomes our entertainment then only it is that vice grows detestable and virtue delightful from the pleasure it brings and hence were the sentiments of the grecian vulgar so exalted that an immoral expression though naturally introduced in an immoral character has been hissed off the stage shall we think then that where the doctrine was so glorious the preaching was dishonorable no sure to be an actor then was not to be a mimic no trick of gesture or tone of voice could avail those of distinction were to be by nature the very persons they represented they were to have the same elevation of soul the same delicacy of thought the same morality of life the same humanity of heart and sweetness of affections that could at once constitute the patriot the hero the lover and the friend the words only belonged to the author the sentiments were by nature their own and hence flowed that aptness of attitude that ease in elocution that expressive look that eloquent silence that freedom of action and that harmony of the whole which at once exalted melted and subdued a mighty nation to elegance and virtue where such an actor was found he was justly esteemed a blessing to the community as his talents were the admiration so his person was the delight of all people in his life he was honored and his posterity provided for you will now perhaps be tempted to wish that this was the stage of the athenians but nature and mankind are always the same and even on the english theater i have known some who gained more encouragement and respect as actors than they deserved as men but if the members of your new province have brought a scandal on their profession let it be your study to retrieve it if i have any judgment you are qualified to excel in this way nor would i have you imagine that any will shun you in private merely because you give them pleasure and entertainment in public let your heart be the true model of whatever is great or good in the characters you represent take instruction with pleasure and applause with humility and then fear not to be received as the man of worth and the gentleman you have hitherto been esteemed i am etc  mr peter bardin was born in dublin though of french extraction he bent his thoughts toward the stage very early in youth and having seen the performance of the best actors in england upon the london stages where at various times he has made one in most of the theaters in that city if he has not improved it must be owing to himself his long intercourse of theatrical action has improved his study and few parts become amiss to him either as shakespeare says for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral scene undividable or poem unlimited etc it does not become me to condemn or uphold his conduct in private life however i cannot avoid giving my opinion that such disputes that have fallen out need not trouble the public in their public diversions i own if a person pays his money for his entertainment he ought to enjoy it quietly if a cook at an ordinary has spoiled another persons dinner that person i think has no right to spoil mine more especially if i had made a tinkers bargain and paid for my meal beforehand give me leave to add a printed paper on the subject whose author has said much more than my capacity will reach  a small animadversion on a late affair in the playhouse i went the other night to the playhouse in full expectation of seeing the rehearsal performed in as high a manner as was possible but to my great surprise the performance was interrupted and the audience disappointed by a concert of most unmusical instruments in the gallery the cause of this noise and hurlyburly was soon found to be a private dispute between somebody in the gallery and bardin the player which dispute might with the consent of the whole theater have subsisted seven years so it had not offended a numerous and polite audience   if a player in his private capacity offends me will this warrant my offending a thousand people at once should i have a dispute at law or play with mr g  ck must the whole town for this reason lose the entertainment of the rarest king lear and macbeth that ever were seen in this or any other country if b  n had done any unwarrantable and injurious thing to a gentleman b  n should have made proper and ample satisfaction in his private capacity for the offense the audience had no right in nor care for b  n but they certainly have for prince volscius he was their player they had paid for him the prince had managed his horse with wondrous dexterity and had an undoubted right to have ridden him to the battle there is nothing more mistaken than that right which some people imagine they have in theaters and other public places for in truth their right consists only in decently partaking of the entertainment and where they think it deserves it giving a proper and timely applause it is the same right that a man has in a ferryboat that is if he behaves himself properly to be safely and pleasantly landed on the opposite shore but if he disturbs the passage and endangers the boat the ferryman and passengers will certainly join and throw him overboard a surly swain at a horserace fansying he had a right to any part of the sod would needs ride directly in the course the first of the racers threw him and his horse twenty yards on the ground and better had it been if he had died with his horse on the spot for he received a lash from every whip in the field every gentleman properly habited has a right to go to court but if a person having a pique to a battleax should breed an uproar in the leveeroom he would certainly have a halberd in his guts or be sent to the black hole there can be no excuse for doing an injury to a multitude  i have often dined at a twodish ordinary where i had a right to partake of each but if i should have taken it into my head to have thrown one dish at the waiter and kicked the other about the floor i do verily believe i should have been kicked down stairs if a gentleman heaven defend us should have a quarrel on his hands with a porter the gentleman certainly has a right to do himself justice but i should think it somewhat untimely if he should knock the fellow down when he had a dozen of my wine on his back shakespeare who well understood the decorum of theaters gives strong advice for proper behavior he speaks it to the players but he meant it to the spectators likewise though in his modesty he held it not meet so to set it down he directs them to be extremely careful not to create the least noise or disturbance in the house when the play should be duly attended to he concludes that to disturb the house is villainous and betrays a pitiful ambition in the fool that does it  i am sirs your humble servant  how necessary it is we may see for stageperformers to have a strict guard on their behavior and i have said it before their own conduct will make them esteemed or slighted will draw regard or insult to strengthen my own opinion i shall insert a very small paragraph from a very late newspaper  naples august         one of the lords of the court has been banished for having publicly insulted upon the new theater one of the singingwomen of the opera  but many things are spoke without a thought that badly construed have confusion brought mr john beamsly this person has had a large experience of time and travel in england and ireland for improving his theatrical genius he is decent in many parts and seldom offends in any is ever very perfect a voice strong and intelligible not unharmonious and may rank in the file of good actors either in tragedy or comedy  merit may shine in various beams of light and different men in different roads are right mrs bullock this gentlewoman was the natural daughter of the late perfect comedian robert wilks esquire by mrs rogers an actress of merit among great stage performers so parented one might have expected a finished genius for the stage she however pleased in several dramatic characters assisted by a graceful form and figure in the year      she was joined in wedlock to mr christopher bullock a very promising comedian who died in the road to excellence  after various turns of fortune she came over to this kingdom with her daughter now mrs dyer her person may put us in mind of her mother but she is a happy stranger to any failing of here is mrs bullock died in this kingdom in the year       a scion often proves different from the root and better branches will yield better fruit miss bellamy this young and amiable actress was born in this kingdom in the year      she has a most admirable improving genius therefore it will be no wonder if she soon reaches the top of perfection she has a liberal open heart to feel and ease the distresses of the wretched how amiable must blooming beauty appear that forms the mind with every moral virtue she has lately left this kingdom to the regret of all lovers of the drama i cannot avoid upon this occasion setting down a few lines from a poem on bellamy the motto from milton  grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye in every gesture dignity and love the maid

asked what place they were in was answered ringsend o then i am sure we are right meaning the answer a a native blunder but to rescue that place from the aspersion i am credibly informed it was the original dwelling of a person whose surname was ring and from him took its denomination the father of this gentleman was a native of holstein holstein is a dukedom of lower saxony in germany one part belongs to the king of denmark the rest the duke of holstein it has two imperial cities the first lubeck a large fair and rich town accumulated by trade and navigation seated about two miles from the

the ruins of the city in flames on one side of her and fronting her london in all its magnificence rebuilt this noble sculpture was designed and finished in bassorelievo by caius gabriel cibber father to the laureat this pillar was begun in      and finished in the year      at the charge of the public in commemoration of that fatal fire in      on the second day of september which consumed    00

the three other squares are filled with inscriptions relating to the fatal accident though some authors impute it to design too long to mention here  were carved by him  mr colley cibber the son of this great artist was born the sixth of november      in london but i shall refer the reader to the apology for his own life printed for g faulkner the excellent dramatic works of this author are

as envy seldom attacks any other object but conspicuous merit this gentleman was generally attacked by the tribe of scribblers his cotemporary authors that like villagecurs bark when their fellows do which he regarded not and if he ever seemed to rouse it was like the lion in don quixot rise stretch and p  ss in his face  as to his person he is strait and well made of an open countenance even free from the conspicuous marks of old age meet or follow him and no person would imagine he ever bore the burden of above two thirds of his years he is head of a numerous family and it might be said as a german author writes of the nestorian lady malburges of that country matter ait natae dic natae filia natam ut moneat natae plangere filiolam   the aged mother to her daughter spoke daughter said she arise thy daughter to her daughter take whose daughters daughter cries mr theophilus cibber this gentleman came into the world on the day of the great and destructive storm in   0  whose rage ranged over the greatest part of europe but i think most fatal to england he is son to colley cibber esquire that excellent comedian the present poet laureat whose dramatic works are so well known  mr theophilus cibber received his education at winchester school his strong genius for the theater brought him early upon the stage where he has appeared in full luster in the various branches of comedy and though he has performed several parts in tragedy with success in my imagination the sock sits easier upon him than the buskin his first wife mentioned in the account of mrs clive was miss johnson by whom he had two daughters the eldest i am informed has appeared on the stage with great prospect of excelling first in the part of juliet in romeo and juliet by shakespeare his second wife miss arne by whom he has no living issue is arrived at the highest pitch of excellence in the amiable soft and tender  mr theophilus cibber has appeared twice as a dramatic author viz first henry the sixth altered from shakespeare which was played in the summerseason of      without any critics laying hold of it his second performance in the drama was a comedy called the lover but as the critics were always ready armed to attack the father they drew their indignation on the son with the false imagination that the father was the concealed author but i am positively convinced to the contrary for that gentleman to me refused the sight of it before it appeared on the stage for the very reasons he suspected that fell out accordingly however he wrote an epilogue that was spoken by mr theophilus and his wife that took away the sting of the revelrout and the play was performed six nights in the year      the epilogue for its singularity i shall insert here  epilogue spoken by the author and his wife wife now i suppose you will find your work is done did not i say  you were your fathers son be what it might your play the town would game it that your bare name were half a cause to damn it experience to your cost will show you now who wears the wiser head your wife or you  author though all this should be true my pretty rogue yet what is all this dear jane to the epilogue  wife why what is an epilogue to such a play will it be saved by ought that i can say  author no matter what is its merit  no my dear when many a husbands case has known despair a wheedling wife has brought the thing to bear  wife o i am your humble servant humble sir now youre distressed you my weak head prefer  no sir since you have had your frolic pay it  when you have raised the storm your wife must lay it  author i will give you composition gentle spouse all my clear benefit of my thirddays house  wife which may amount to  not one single souse  author were mine alone the case that may be true yet to your very sex some pitys due they will not with me destroy the guiltless too  wife to the audience gallants in this i hope he has touched your hearts let not me suffer for his weak deserts do not to last extremes your censure drive give us at least an honest chance to live our fate is in your hands  if you are brave you will think the triumph less to ruin than to save  this comedy the author dedicated to his wife in order to make a perfect agreement between them he has also wrote several small pieces in verse and prose occasionally besides several letters in an odd dispute between him and mr thomas sheridan printed here and in london  i shall not meddle with conjugal affairs these short memoirs would swell too large and the belly out of proportion for the body appear dropsical and require tapping  then draw a veil over what must be concealed to hide those faults that should not be revealed mrs cibber this true and perfect actress was daughter to mr arne an eminent upholder in covent garden her first appearance on the stage was as a singer her voice and judgment gained her universal applause but when she commenced a speaking actress she charmed anew her first appearance was in the part of zara to the admiration of every spectator that had their auricular faculties and since that has proved herself the daughter of nature in perfection i shall add a prologue wrote by the laureat on her first appearing in the part of zara and leave her to enjoy her deserved praise  spoke by mr cibber the french however mercurial they may seem extinguish half their fire by critic phlegm while english writers natures freedom claim and warm their scenes with an ungoverned flame it is strange that nature never should inspire a racines judgment with a shakespeares fire however tonight to promise much we are loath but  you have a chance to have a taste of both from english plays zaras french author fired confessed his muse beyond herself inspired from racked othellos rage he raised his style and snatched the brand that lights this tragic pile zaras success his utmost hopes outflew and a twice twentieth weeping audience drew as for our english friend he leaves to you whatever may seem to his performance due no views of gain his hopes or fears engage he gives a child of leisure to the stage willing to try if yet forsaken nature can charm with any one remembered feature thus far the author speaks  but now the player with trembling heart presents his humble prayer tonight the greatest venture of my life is lost or saved as you receive  a wife if time you think may ripen her to merit with gentle smiles support her wavering spirit zara in france at once an actress raised warmed into skill by being kindly praised o could such wonders here from favor flow how would our zaras heart with transport glow but she alas by juster fears oppressed begs but your bare endurance at the best her unskilled tongue would simple nature speak nor dares her bounds for false applauses break amidst a thousand faults her best pretense to please  is unpresuming innocence when a chaste hearts distress your grief demands one silent tear outweighs a thousand hands if she conveys the pleasing passions right guard and support her this decisive night if she mistakes or finds her strength too small let interposing pity break her fall  in you it rests to save her or destroy if she draws tears from you  i weep  for joy mr oliver cashel i know little more of this gentleman than that he was born in ireland of a very ancient reputable family he commenced actor in this kingdom where he made but slow progress as i have been informed he was recommended to the manager in drurylam by his friend and countryman mr charles macklin who brought him from the bristol theater where they both played the summer before i think in the year       the first part he played on drurylam theater was sir julius caefar in sir walter ralegh where his good figure was his best friend for fear had made his voice not his own if i may be allowed that term it is a theatrical observation that fear in the first settingout attempt on the stage is not an il omen for many that have set on without it have played their best and never mended afterward this gentleman is one proof of it for he got the better of his fear proving a very good theatrical officer in a little time the first dramatic piece of mr dryden that great poet was a comedy called the wild gallant that met with so little success as langbain says that if he had not a peculiar force of inclination to the drama he would have been sufficiently discouraged from any farther progress in dramatic writing  and i hear since i have left england has so far excelled in captain macheath in the beggars opera which requires a good singer to the qualifications of a good actor that his merit has given this excellent piece a large fresh run in covent garden which he went to from drury lane eight or nine years ago  this gentleman died at norwich the capital city of the county of norfolk he was taken speechless on the stage in the part of frankly in a comedy called the suspicious husband he was carried to his lodgings where physicians and surgeons attended but to no purpose for he expired in a few hours in spite of the doctor  death eases lovers sets the captive free and though a tyrant offers liberty mrs catharine clive formerly miss raftor this celebrated natural actress was the daughter of mr william raftor a gentleman born in the city of kilkenny in ireland the father of her father was possessed of a considerable paternal estate in the county where he was born but the parent of our actress being unhappily attached to the unfortunate king james the second the late revolution gave it among many others to the crown mr james raftor her brother went over to ireland some years ago in order to solicit for his grandfathers fortune but did not meet with success  mr william raftor the father was bred to the law however when king james was in ireland he entered into his service and after the decisive battle of the boyne in the year    0 he followed his masters fortune and by his merit obtained a captains commission in the service of lewis the fourteenth but gaining a pardon with many other gentlemen in his condition he came to england where he married mrs daniel daughter to an eminent citizen on fishstreethill with whom he had a handsome fortune by her he had a numerous issue  miss catharine was born in the year      she had an early genius for the stage for she told me when she was about twelve years old miss johnson afterward the first wife of mr theo cibber another rising genius if death had not overtaken her in her prime of youth and she used to tag after the celebrated mr wilks her own words whenever they saw him in the streets and gape at him as a wonder  miss raftor had a facetious turn of humor and infinite spirits with a voice and manner in finging songs of pleasantry peculiar to herself those talents mr theo cibber and i we all at that time living together in one house thought a sufficient pasport to the theater we recommended her to the laureat whose infallible judgment soon found out her excellencies and the moment he heard her sing put her down in the list of performers at twenty shillings per week but never any person of her age flew to perfection with such rapidity and the old discerning managers always distinguished merit by reward her first appearance was in the play of mithridates king of pontus in ismenes the page to ziphares in boys clothes where a song proper to the circumstances of the scene was introduced which she performed with extraordinary applause but after this like a bullet in the air there was no distinguishing the track till it came to its utmost execution  i remember the first night of love in a riddle which was murdered in the same year a pastoral opera wrote by the laureat which the hydraheaded multitude resolved to worry without hearing a custom with authors of merit when miss raftor came on in the part of phillida the monstrous roar subsided a person in the stage box next to my post called out to his companion in the following elegant style  zounds tom take care or this charming little devil will save all  in the year      she was married to mr g clive son to mr baron clive i shall be silent in conjugal affairs but in all my long acquaintance with her i could never imagine she deserved ill usage  i shall take leave of this excellent actress with the following lines as every part cannot fit the best performers merit mistaken often may lose its way and pore in darkness with the blaze of day   mademoiselle chateauneuf this agreeable dancer as she played polly in the beggars opera etc must come under my cognizance she was born in france what town or province has stole from my memory her real name was not what she bore she was in her infancy an orphan and monsieur chateauneuf took her from her distresses and bred her up as his own daughter her virtue never was tainted in most peoples opinion but as our immortal shakespeare says be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shall not scape calumny   when i was instructing her in the part of polly she told me a lady that morning was surprised to hear from a gentleman of her acquaintance that she was taken for a boy in disguise this gentleman it seems was a person that would have been very willing to have been certain of the distinction of sexes i told the lady said miss chateauneuf i was very glad he knew no more of me which i think was a quick and witty answer she was born the same day that our young hero the duke came into the world april          since leaving this kingdom she is married to her supposed father monsieur chateauneuf and now it is made her real name this intelligence i had from a gentleman that lately came from bourdeaux it is possible every body cannot tell where bourdeaux lies it is a very fine city and seaport the capital of the province of guicnne it is graced with a parliament a university and an archbishop seated on the fine river garonne and is esteemed one of the richest trading cities in france ausonius a celebrated latin poet owes his birth to this place most lovers of bacchus very much commend the growth of its grape one of our english monarchs richard the second drew here his first breath this dukedom was once an attendant upon the crown of england as tacked to the tail of eleanor heiress of poictiers wedded to king henry the second which is my chief reason for this scrap of geography there is also a very handsome theater in this city and the country exceeding pleasant about it being in the south of france  where he conversed with them being at the head of a troop of comedians of their own where he heard madem chateauneuf sing several english songs by desire of the audience particularly the song of rosy wine from the masque of comus altered from milton  thus midwife time brings many things to light that long lay hid within the womb of night mrs chetwood she was upon this stage in the year      an agreeable actress when the part suited her voice a tolerable dancer and a pleasing colombine being granddaughter to the present laureat it is no wonder if she had a little wit  but wit and wisdom seldom well agree wisdom would fetter what the wit would free mr denis delane is a native of ireland descended from an ancient family he received his education in trinity college dublin a fountain of learning whose streams have watered the universe  he appeared first on the dublin stage and was very well received his person and excellent voice joined with his other merits gained him the esteem as he justly deserved however he set out for london where he was recommended to the managers of drury lane i think in the year      but their company being brimful even to the running over the managers did not give him the encouragement that the promise of his voice and person deserved mr giffard took hold of the occasion and engaged him for his theater in goodmans fields where he had a better opportunity of shining without any rival ray mr quin as i am informed who can distinguish merit from his own superior judgment prevailed upon him to leave that corner of the town and act on the same stage with him covent garden persons of the drama may be compared to the swisscantons willing to fight for those who give the best pay therefore it is no novelty to see them change sides  mr delane is now marching under the banner of covent garden he has an estate in this kingdom and came over last year though i had not the pleasure of seeing him i am informed he is inclining more to the bulky since i saw him last which is a recommendation to many capital parts that may sit easy and give pleasure when the bloom of youth is gone  truncheons or lawn do seldom youth become for distant war or bishoprics at home mr dyer is not only a useful but a very pleasing actor his good voice and easyacquired manner gives him a cast above many of his cotemporaries being the best allowed singer on the dublin theater that is not a professed singer i am no friend to mimicry yet if i could be pleased with that natural qualification if i may be allowed to call it so i do not know one could give me more pleasure than mr dyer for he can take off as the theatrical term expresses it not only every actor male and female he has seen and heard worth mimicking but also singers and dancers foreign and domestic all these qualifications joined to a good understanding will render him acceptable in any theater  a just behavior claims a due regard though modesty will fail to meet reward thomas elrington esquire this excellent actor was born in june      in london his father having a numerous issue put his son apprentice to an upholder in covent garden where i was first acquainted with him he was early addicted to the drama i remember when he was an apprentice we played in several private plays together when we were preparing to act sophonisba or hannibals overthrow after i had wrote out my part of massiva i carried him the book of the play to study the part of king masinissa i found him finishing a velvet cushion and gave him the book but alas before he could secret it his master a hot voluble frenchman came in upon us and the book was thrust under the velvet of the cushion his master as usual rated him for not working with a mortbleu why a you not vark tom and stood over him so long that i saw with some mortification the book irrecoverably stitched up in the cushion never to be retrieved till the cushion is worn to pieces poor tom cast many a desponding look upon me when he was finishing the fate of the play while every stitch went to both our hearts his master observing our looks turned to me and with words that broke their necks over each other for haste abused both of us the most intelligible of his great number of words were jack pudenges and the like expressions of contempt  but our play was gone for ever another time we were so bold to attempt shakespeares hamlet where our prentice tom had the part of the ghost father to young hamlet his armor was composed of pasteboard neatly painted the frenchman had intelligence of what we were about and to our great surprise and mortification made one of our audience the ghost in its first appearance is dumb to horatio while these scenes past the frenchman only muttered between his teeth and we were in hopes his passion would subside but when our ghost began his first speech to hamlet mark me he replied begar me vil mark you presently and without saying any more beat our poor ghost off the stage through the street while every stroke on the pasteboard armor grieved the auditors because they did not pay for their seats insomuch that three or four ran after the ghost and brought him back in triumph with the avenging frenchman at his heels who would not be appeased till our ghost promised him never to commit the offense of acting again a promise made like many others never intended to be kept however in the last year of his time his rigid master gave him a little more liberty and our young actor played different parts till he was taken notice of by mr keen an excellent player at that time he was introduced upon the stage in the part of oroonoko where he met with a good reception in the year       the next season he was invited over by joseph ashbury esquire and in the year      wedded the daughter of that worthy gentleman by whom he had a numerous issue particularly three sons who are now alive the eldest mr joseph elrington who makes a considerable figure on the present theater here mr richard elrington now of a country company in england and mr thomas elrington the youngest first an ensign now a lieutenant in colonel flemmings regiment in flanders  mr elrington the father was a true copy of mr verbruggen a very great actor in tragedy and polite parts in comedy but the former had an infinite fund of what is called low humor upon the stage i have seen him perform don choleric in the fops fortune with infinite pleasure he entered into the true humor of the character equal to the original mr william penkethman his voice was manly strong and sweetly fulltond his figure tall and wellproportiond his eldest son mr joseph elrington is most like him in person and countenance  this excellent player succeeded his fatherinlaw joseph ashbury esquire in the place of steward of the kingsinns and the more to establish him in the kingdom a post was given him of fifty pounds a year in the quitrent office also gunner to the train of artillery a gift of the lord mountjoy father to the present earl of blessington which at the death of that noble lord he got permission to dispose of he was a gentleman of honor humanity and extensive goodnature of a facetious well mannerd conversation a little too desirable for his health from company of the best condition he was taken ill the very day he was consulting a plan for a new theater after the form of that in drury lane london with an eminent builder of this city he went home where his malady increased to a violent pleuritic fever which never left him notwithstanding all the physicians art till he expired july         he was interred in st michans churchyard near the remains of his fatherinlaw joseph ashbury esquire mr elrington had one daughter married to mr wrightson now in england with a country company i never saw her but have been informed she has many promising theatrical talents   i shall leave him to eternal rest with the following lines and a short epitaph  thus when our stated time of life is come and power almighty has pronounced our doom the best physicians art is shown in vain and deaths the doctor that must end our pain epitaph on thomas elrington esquire thou best of actors here interred no more thy charming voice is heard this grave thy coarse contains thy better part which used to move our admiration and our love has fled its sad remains though there is no monumental brass thy sacred relics to encase thou wondrous man of art a lover of the muse divine o elrington shall be thy shrine and carve thee in his heart mr francis elrington was born in london in the year       he had a small post in the wardrobe under his grace the duke of montague but hearing the success of his elder brother in ireland he left his post to follow the call he had to the stage by his theatrical observations in england he set out in ireland with success improving his talents so well that he gave the utmost satisfaction in many capital parts his grace the duke of dorset when lord lieutenant of ireland gave him a post in the revenue which he faithfully executed and enjoyed to his death  he was in a languishing state of health near two years but the last stroke he received at kilkenny where part of the company were playing during the time of the camp being at bennetsbridge he was carried back to his house in drumcondralane where after a few days struggle death overcame him in august      in the   d year of his age of a polypus a polypus is an excrescence or fleshy fungous substance that grows in or about the heart a slow but certain death this distemper is sometimes found in the thick membrane of the brain which proves fatal this disease often seizes the nose and other hollow parts of the body fixing its fibers like the root of a plant which must be cut off and entirely eradicated or it will grow again  how many ways has proud imperious death to plunder storm and steal away our breath   to the regret of all his acquaintance  mr ralph elrington is the younger brother of the late eminent player thomas elrington esquire born in england and came early upon the stage though without any countenance as i have been informed from his friends and relations since his elder brothers death he has undertaken many of his parts which he copies as near as possible  he was admired some years ago as a good executing harlequin agility and strength being two main ingredients in the composition of that motly gentleman where heels are of more use than the head in one of his feats of activity he was much hurt and was in some danger of breaking his neck to please the spectators the ears having little to do in such entertainments yet this unlucky spring met with universal applause  i remember a tumbler in the haymarket theater in london by such an accident beat the breath out of his body which raised such vociferous applause that lasted longer than the venurous mans life for he never breathed more indeed his wife had this comfort when the truth was known pity succeeded to the roar of applause  another accident like this fell out in dr faustus a pantomime entertainment in lincolnsinnfields theater where a machine in the working broke threw the mock pierrot down headlong with such force that the poor man broke a plank on the stage with his fall and expired another was so sorely maimed that he did not survive many days and a third one of the softer sex broke her thigh but to prevent such accidents for the future those persons are represented by inanimate figures so that if they break a neck a leg or an arm there needs no surgeon  another accident of the same kind happened in smockalley which gave me much concern as having a hand in the contrivance the late mr morgan being to fly on the back of a witch in the lancashire witches through the ignorance of the workers in the machinery the fly broke and they both fell together but through providence they neither of them were much hurt and such care was taken afterward that no accident of that kind could happen  when dangers fled it dwells upon the mind and leaves the strong impression still behind mr richard estcourt this excellent comedian was born at tewksbury in the county of gloucester in the year      where he received his education in the latin school of that town he had an early desire for the stage for in the   th year of his age he stole from his fathers house with a country company and at worcester for fear of being known set out with the part of roxana in womans apparel in alexander the great but his father having notice of it sent to secure the fugitive who made his escape in a suit of womans clothes that he borrowed of one of the itinerant ladies and trudged it to chippingnorton a corporationtown in oxfordshire twentyfive long miles in one day when he came to the inn beds were scarce and he was obliged to take up with that of the daughters behind the bar the young woman going to bed found the wearied traveller in a profound sleep but observing the shirt instead of a shift she began to suspect her designed bedfellow and stooping to look on the dress that lay upon the ground she saw a pair of mans shoes under the bed that convinced her she might have been in an odd situation if she had gone to bed in the dark she upon the discovery instantly called in the people of the house and waked our drowsy traveller the landlord had designed to carry him decently to the horsepond till dick made a true confession of the whole affair by accident a person of the town of tewksbury put up at the said inn that night who knew our young disguised wanderer and that knowledge signed his pardon in two days afterward his clothes were brought him from worcester accompanied with a messenger from his father who led him the road home again  soon after the father went with him to london where he bound him fast to an apothecary in hattongarden he was too impatient to wait so long a time for liberty therefore he stretched his bonds till they broke and after an itinerant life two years in england he went to try his fortune in ireland where he shone in an exalted theatrical sphere for some years when he returned to london where by his wit and mimic humor his conversation was taken up by persons of the highest rank and parts  he was made providore of the beefstakeclub and for a mark of distinction wore their badge which was a small gridiron of gold hung about his neck with a green silk ribband this club was composed of the chief wits and great men of the nation  mr estcourt was the original sergeant kite and every night of performance entertained the audience with variety of little catches and flights of humor that pleased all but his critics he was a great favorite with the late duke of marlborough whose just fame he celebrated in several outofthe way witty ballads he was author of a comedy called the wifes excuse or cuckolds make themselves and acted at the theater royal in the year   0  but as i have been informed with moderate success another little piece was produced by him called prunella a burlesque upon the italian operas then stole into fashion too much supported by the excellent voice and judgment of mrs tofts but such an odd medley  mrs tofts a mere englishwoman in the part of camilla courted by nicolini in italian without understanding one single syllable each other said or sung and on the other hand valentini courting amorously in the same language a dutchwoman that committed murder on our good old english with as little understanding as a parrot though it was reported a lady of some quality fell desperately in love with nicolini which occasioned the following lines that were pinned to nicolinis coat in a chocolatehouse  soft thrilling notes swelled out with art may wound alas the fair ones heart yet these italians will not feel the wounds they give they cannot heal yet notwithstanding the lashes given by estcourt and others the enervating weakness took more hold like folly and new sects in religion persecution but gains more proselytes  this celebrated comedian paid his debt to nature in the year      after leaving the stage some years sir richard steel gives him this character in his lucubrations an excellent companion one who was perfectly master of wellturned compliments as well as smart repartees which shows a ready wit the first account of this eminent performer i had from the late mr john bowman an actor more than half an age on the london theaters  this gentleman was born in the year      and died in the year      i have often heard him say he never remembered that any indisposition retarded his coming to the theater during his long course of life and this declaration was made not a month before he died he never met with contempt in the latter part of his life and we may end with two lines in jane shore age sat with decent grace upon his visage and worthily became his silver locks      mr john evans this person was an actor of very good repute in this kingdom joined in the management with mr thomas elrington mr thomas griffith etc his person was inclineable to the gross therefore wanted delicacy for the amiable parts he had an excellent harmonious voice and just delivery but a little too indolent for much study or contemplation  in the last year of the reign of queen anne the company of dublin went down in the summer season to play at cork one evening mr evans was invited by some officers of a regiment then on duty in that city to a tavern many healths were proposed and went round without reluctance when it came to mr evanss turn he proposed the health of her majesty queen anne which so much disgusted one of the company though clothed in the livery of his royal mistress that he ran down stairs and sent up a drawer to whisper mr evans who immediately put on his sword and went after him without taking the least notice to the company he found his antagonist in a room in the passage of the tavern with the door half open who courageously made a thrust at mr evans which he put by with his left hand at this mr evans drew thrust the door wide open entered and soon drove his opposer out to the passage where he disarmed the doughty hero before the company above stairs knew any thing of the matter the rest of the military gentlemen expressed an abhorrence to the treatment mr evans received and seemingly reconciled them on the spot but notwithstanding when the company returned to dublin the person who sent the challenge up stairs at cork being then returned also told his own story in such a manner that several warm gentlemen of the army were made to believe that mr evans had affronted the whole body military and when the poor supposed culprit came to his business of the theater their clamor in the audience was so great that the house was dismissed and no play to be acted till mr evans had asked public pardon upon the stage his high spirit was with great difficulty brought to submit but at last he consented i remember the play was the rival queens or the death of alexander the great the part of alexander to be acted by the delinquent he came to ask pardon before the curtain when he addressed the audience one smart from the pit cried out kneel you rascal evans then collected in himself replied in the same tone of voice no you rascal i will kneel to none but god and my queen a dangerous paroxysm at such a crisis however as there were many worthy gentlemen of the army who knew the whole affair the newraised clamor ceased and the play went through without any molestation and by degrees things returned to their proper chanel by this we may see it is some danger for an actor to be in the right  three years after this affair mr evans went to the theater in lincolnsinnfields and in his journey back to ireland was taken ill of a fever at the town of whitchurch in shorpshire from whence he was removed for better advice to chester where he ended his progress of life in the   st year of his age and was privately buried in the cathedral without monument stone or inscription  thus may great merit in oblivion lie and rest forgotten to eternity mr william este this gentleman was related to the late bishop of waterford he died in the prime of youth in the year      it is a pity he took such pains in getting the better of his constitution but he succeeded at a time when he might have made some figure on the stage he had qualifications sufficient for improvement some learning a person amiable a sweet voice and sung not unpleasingly notwithstanding the neglect of himself depreciated his merit he truly made out a saying of that late great comedian mr wilks the man that drinks a glass of strong liquor in a morning for every one he swallows drives a nail in his coffin many a genius has been drowned in drink i remember an author whose sweet writings will keep his memory fragrant that was so much addicted to that weakness that if there were no other spirits to be come at he would empty a ladys hungary waterbottle and yet the flowing numbers of his pen seemed as if he had drank no other liquid but what came from the pure streams of helicon i shall end this with shakespeares reflection from the mouth of cassio in othello  o that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou have no name to be known by let us call thee devil  he died of a lingering illness the   th of january        mrs elmy her maiden name was mors she was born in england but when or where i know not mr elmy her husband i know was born at norwich but where he is now i believe neither she nor i can tell  she has been an actress about seventeen years began very young and was entered first in a country company she knows what she does as well as what she says she seems to have more spirits off the stage in a chamber than she has in the public theater which is owing to her weak voice but she means very well there i do not know her well enough to be any judge of her morals therefore i shall not speak of what i do not know and even this i have gathered more from common fame than my own particular knowledge therefore i shall not say any more of her as fame is a gossip not always to be believed as hudibras tells us  there is a tall longsided dame but wondrous light ycleped fame two trumpets she does sound at once but both of clean contrary tones but whether both with the same wind or one before or one behind we know not  only this can tell the one sounds vilely the other well and therefore vulgar authors name the one good the other evil fame mr george farquhar since this gentleman owes his birth to this kingdom and on the irish stage commenced actor i hope it will not be thought improper to give a short account of him which i shall take from his life that i collected several years past to prefix to his works the materials i received from mr wilks who approved of them before they went to the publisher  mr george farquhar was born in the north of ireland of parents that held no mean rank in that part of the country who having a numerous issue could bestow on him no other fortune than a genteel education as those who are blessed with a poetical genius always show some glimmerings of their fancy in their youth so he ere he arrived at his tenth year gave several specimens of a peculiar turn that way one of his juvenile productions i shall here mention in which he discovered a way of thinking as well as an elegancy of expression far beyond his years  i took these lines of verse from the mouth of mr wilks the pliant soul of erring youth is like soft wax or moistened clay apt to receive all heavenly truth or yield to tyrant ill the sway shun evil in your early years and manhood may to virtue rise but he who in his youth appears a fool in age will never be wise he was educated in the university of dublin where he acquired a considerable reputation he began very early to apply himself to the stage as an actor following the examples of lee and otway with our great shakespeare and with like success who though all excellent dramatic poets made but indifferent actors however mr farquhar having the advantage of a very good person though with a weak voice was never repulsed by the audience but the following accident made him determine to leave off the occupation playing the part of guyomar in the indian emperor who is supposed to kill vasquez one of the spanish generals not remembering to change his sword for a foil foils are the name of those swords used in the theater with the edges ground off and a blunted point  in the mock engagement he wounded the person that represented vasquez though as it fell out not dangerously nevertheless it put an end to his appearing on the stage as an actor  he was very young when he wrote his first comedy of love and a bottle acted at the theater royal in drury lane school he was peculiarly happy in the choice of his subjects which he took care to adorn with variety of characters and incidents he lashed the vices of the age though with a merciful hand his plays were wrote in the following order   love and a bottle school   the constant couple   00 this piece was played    nights the first season   sir harry wildair the sequel to the former   0    nights   inconstant or the way to win him   0     nights   twin rivals   0     nights   recruiting officer   0     nights   the beaux stratagem    0  0 nights all acted at the theater royal in drury lane his last comedy he wrote in six weeks with a settled illness all the time he perceived the approaches of death before he had finished the last act and as he had often foretold died before the run of the play was over it was affirmed by some of his near acquaintance his unfortunate marriage shortened his days for his wife by whom he had two daughters through the reputation of a great fortune tricked him into matrimony this was chiefly the fault of her love which was so violent that she was resolved to use all arts to gain him though some husbands in such a case would have proved mere husbands yet he was so much charmed with her love and understanding that he lived very happy with her therefore when i say an unfortunate marriage with other circumstances conduced to the shortening of his days i only mean that his fortune being too slender to support a family led him into a great many cares and inconveniences for i have often heard him say mr wilkss own words  that it was more pain to him in imagining that his family might want a needful support than the most violent death that could be inflicted on him mr farquhar was a person of infinite humor as i have been informed even in his last indisposition he died in the run of the stratagem mr wilks often visited him in his illness in one of these visits mr wilks told mr farquhar that mrs oldfield thought he had dealt too freely with the character of mrs sullen in giving her to archer without a proper divorce which was not a security for her honor to salve that replied the author i will get a real divorce  marry her myself and give her my bond she shall be a real widow in less than a fortnight while mr farquhar was in trinity college dublin he sent to a gentleman to borrow burnets history of the reformation but the gentleman sent him word he never lent any book out of his chamber but if he would come there he should make use of it as long as he pleased a little while after the owner of the book sent to borrow mr farquhars bellows he returned him the compliment  i never lend my bellows out of my own chamber but if he pleased to come there be should make use of them as long as he would when he expired mr wilks took care to bury him decently in st martin in the fields among his papers he found this short note  dear bob i have not any thing to leave thee to perpetuate my memory but two helpless girls look upon them sometimes and think of him that was to the last moments of his life thine  g farquhar   even the two last lines he ever wrote seemed to be playing with words  death now appears to seize my latest breath but all my miseries will end in death mr farquhar attempted to play the part of sir harry wildair for his own benefit as i am informed from a gentleman that saw him in this kingdom which answered his design in gaining a crowded audience but he executed the part so lamely as an actor that his friends were ashamed for him thus we see a good poet may make but an indifferent actor     the mind diseased strikes poison to the heart and baffles all the best physicians art mr foot as i never had the fortune to be present at this gentlemans public performance i cannot pretend to be a competent judge of his merit though i must own i have heard him launch out into mimicry which might perhaps give pleasure to others but i must own very little to me  i remember an instance of this kind of satire in my youth that gave satisfaction to some light hearts but greater disgust to the more judicious sort of the audience  mr george powell a reputable actor with many excellencies gave out that he would perform the part of sir john falstaff in the manner of that very excellent english roscius mr betterton he certainly hit his manner and tone of voice yet to make the picture more like he mimickd the infirmities of distemper old age and the afflicting pains of the gout which that great man was often seized with certainly mimicry is a gift from nature and laudable if made use of like the ancient mimes who could dumbly describe every passion of the mind and tell a tale without a tongue but to mimic the infirmities of nature may well be termed incivility barbarity and inhumanity  i remember durfey the late lyric poet stuttered extremely when in a passion though he could speak an oration read a scene in a play or sing any of his own songs or dialogues without the least hesitation he came one morning to the rehearsal a little disturbed about a depending benefit play and asked in a passion wh wh where wa wa was m m mr wi wilks the drole penkethman answered h h he d d did n n not kn kn know but the choleric poet broke his head for his joke and it was with great difficulty the bard was appeased  mimicry as it now stands with us is like a statue larger than the life made for a certain height and distance while upon the level with you its coarse proportion seems monstrous and overdone many excellent comedians have had this natural talent mr rymer that great critic tells us that mr mountford was so excellently gifted that way if we may call it excellence that when he was trainbearer to the late chancellor jefferies in the reign of king james the second at an entertainment for the most eminent lawyers his master ordered him to come before him and plead a feigned cause which he performed with great eloquence and in his pleadings to the admiration of all present assumed the manner and voice of several of the best pleaders then at the bar even some of those that were present at the entertainment as i said before every thing of this kind must be overdone to make it the more ridiculous and actors of great merit thus mimickd are liable to some little disgrace which is neither justice nor goodnature i have seen faces painted in a scene of a multitude which is generally used in drury lane theater at the coronation of anna bullen that make most ridiculous figures so like to be known and yet the persons they represent have nothing particularly faulty in their countenance or figures but the painter was a merry italian wag and did it to show his exuberant fancy  but to return to mr foot he is a gentleman of a good family and seems to have some claim to the estate of the goodieres one of that family was not many years past murdered by his own brother at bristol i believe he has merit or a woudbewit would not have published the following lines in the newspapers for i have observed those that have merit are generally liable to bespattering defamation however here are the lines  on a pseudoplayer thou mimic of cibber  of garrick thou ape thou fop in othello thou cipher in shape thou trifle in person thou puppet in voice thou farce of a player thou rattle for boys thou mongrel thou dirtyface harlequin thing thou puff of bad paste thou gingerbreadking was a quin or delane the boast of our stage set up as fit marks for thy envy or rage was a quin or delane who excel in their art to be apd by a cobbler who bungles his part thou mummer in action thou coffeehouse jester thou mimic sans sense mock hero in gesture can the squeak of a puppet present us a quin or a pigmy or dwarf show a giants design shall deficience unpunished at excellence rail or a sprat without ridicule mimic a whale can a foot represent us the length of a yard where then shall such insolence meet its reward contempt were the best like the mastiff that feels with superior derision the cur at his heels  o ireland too prone to encourage new toys in trinkets and novelty fickle as boys o dublin alas to a proverb well known to receive what is foreign yet scoff at thy own learn truly to judge twixt a f  t and a tune applaud the good player  but damn the buffoon this poet is too passionate to be in the right neither would i have inserted it if i had not received it enclosed with the following laconic epistle  sir i know what you are about insert the enclosed in its proper place or you will neither do yourself or your readers justice if you fail you shall hear of it   bob   notwithstanding this angry author i dare swear it will not do the gentleman any prejudice for passion is the worst persuader in the world for as the poet says truth is too naked of all art bereaved since the world will  why  let them be deceived   mrs furnival i cannot tell when mrs furnival first commenced actress but i know her reputation for a stageperformer was so great that a person of high birth and station who had seen her act several capital parts at the theater in york prevailed on the manager of drury lane to send for her in the year      accordingly i received a commission for that purpose which she approved of the first part she acted at her arrival in london was that of the scornful lady in a comedy of beaumont and fletchers that bears the title i own it was a character of my own choosing and for no other reason but that the play had slept since the death of the inimitable mrs oldfield the success did not entirely answer the meaning of my intention though she acquitted herself so well that there was a very good actress in prospect but the parts in tragedy were so taken up that her talent that way was never once tried in the theater royal in drury lane therefore by the advice of the same worthy gentleman that was the cause of her leaving york for london she left london for dublin where her merit was so conspicuous that her loss is much regretted she is once more returned to england i believe without any other advice but her own yet i fear she will be remembered here till a better alicia in jane shore lady macbeth hermione in the distressed mother or zara in the mourning bride with many other parts rises up to outdo her  but what at first gives infinite delight when often seen hangs heavy on the sight david garrick esquire this complete actor was born in staffordshire of an ancient family in that county had a genteel education and was by his father designed for the law i doubt not from his good sense and affability if he had continued in that honorable society in lincolns end but he might have made a considerable figure at the bar and by his elocution walked in the foremost rank of eminent orators  his genius led him early to study nature and leave the crabbed tracts of the law his facetious good humor gained him entrance behind the scenes two or three years in drury lane before he commenced actor where his excellent understanding could profit by the faults of others mend them and improve the beauties  in the year    0 he set out in full luster at the theater in goodmansfields with the part of richard the third and by the force of attraction drew even the court to the farthest suburbs of london after making that remote part of the town as familiar to courtiers and quality as wapping to sailors he came with a blaze of light to drury lane where he began with an act of charity worthy of his humanity and goodness by assisting the widow of mr harper with a sum that by good management will make her circumstances easy the rest of her life she was at kilkenny the place of her birth two summers ago where i received this account from her own mouth the part he performed was chamont in the orphan  when this gentleman was in this kingdom last i was unfortunately seized by a stubborn indisposition and his goodnature prevailed upon the eminent dr barry to give me his assistance but what need i repeat to those that are not blind that the sun shines in summer i shall end with two copies of verses that were printed at his first arrival in the newspapers at that time  on mr garrick cur in theatrum cato severe venisti an ideo tantum veneras ut exires mart in roman days once cato the severe with awful brow went to the theater but o instead of manly fire and rage and all the true pathetic of the stage he saw he heard the rant the droll the stare saw nature and the passions murdered there  saw and retired  but should he now revive and see glad nature in her garrick live he would laugh at bays and weep with injured lear curse tyrant richard but applaud the player by joy rage pity all the passions moved garrick would well by cato be approved the wise the virtuous cato would forbear his rigid censures and in raptures swear that by some power divine the stage was trod and in the matchless actor own the god this great actor is author of three dramatic pieces the lying valet miss in her teens and lethe as also several wellwrote prologues epilogues songs and poems of a peculiar turn of wit i shall take leave to insert one song as a specimen  to sylvia if truth can fix thy wavering heart let damon urge his claim he feels the passion void of art the pure and constant flame though sighing swains their torments tell their sensual love contemn they only prize the beauteous shell but slight the inward gem possession cures the wounded heart destroys the transient fire but when the mind receives the dart enjoyment whets desire your charms each slavish sense control a tyrants shortlived reign but milder reason rules the soul nor time can break the chain by age your beauties will decay your mind improves with years and when the blossoms fade away the ripening fruit appears may heaven and sylvia grant my suit and bless each future hour that damon who can taste the fruit may gather every flower thomas griffith esquire is descended from an ancient family in wales his parents came to settle in dublin where this son was born in the year    0 he was put prentice to a mathematical instrumentmaker but a livelyspirited genius made him cast his thoughts toward the theater when he saw a young actress that had sufficient charms to engage his heart the passion of love is not to be controuled in youth he married her before he had served a third part of his time quitting his mathematical master and bent his thoughts entirely to the drama his talent led him to comedy of the merry cast in which he gave great pleasure to the audience  his wit and facetious humor gained him many friends of the best sort and superior rank in the year    0 the late lord southwell gave him a post in the revenue which he enjoyed till death which fell out in january          in his grand climacteric two days before the night of his benefit which was performed for the widow his second wife who was daughter to the rev mr foxcroft of portarlington in the queens county a gentlewoman of merit and virtue  mr griffith was not only a good actor but a pleasing poet in what he attempted his person was well made though low in stature i have seen a bill of mock alexander runs thus  the part of alexander the great to be performed by little griffith he was an excellent companion and told a story with a peculiar grace and would often tell little histories of himself even in ridicule of himself i shall mention one i had from his own mouth  after his commencing actor he contracted a friendship with mr wilks which chain remained unbroke till the death of that excellent comedian though mr griffith was very young mr wilks took him with him to london and had him entered for that season at a small salary the indian emperor being ordered on a sudden to be played the part of pizarro a spaniard was wanting which mr griffith procured with some difficulty mr betterton being a little indisposed would not venture out to rehearsal for fear of increasing his indisposition to the disappointment of the audience who had not seen our young stripling rehearse but when he came ready at the entrance his ears were pierced with a voice not familiar to him he cast his eyes upon the stage where he beheld the diminutive pizarro with a truncheon as long as himself his own words he steps up to downs the prompter and cried zounds downs what sucking scaramouch have you sent on there sir replied downs he is good enough for a spaniard the part is small betterton returned if he had made his eyebrows his whiskers and each whisker a line the part would have been two lines too much for such a monkey in buskins poor griffith stood on the stage near the door and heard every syllable of the short dialogue and by his fears knew who was meant by it but happy for him he had no more to speak that scene when the first act was over by the advice of downs he went to make his excuse with  indeed sir i had not taken the part but there was only i alone out of the play i i replied betterton with a smile thou art but the tittle of an i griffith seeing him in no ill humor told him indians ought to be the best figures on the stage as nature had made them very like replied betterton but it would be a double death to an indian cobbler to be conquered by such a weazle of a spaniard as thou art and after this night let me never see a truncheon in thy hand again unless to stir the fire this story as i said before was of his own telling however he took his advice laid aside the buskin and stuck to the sock in which he made a figure equal to most of his cotemporaries  our genius flutters with the plumes of youth but observation wings to steady truth mr henry giffard this gentleman is descended from an ancient family originally in buckinghamshire his father had a numerous issue he being the last of eight sons he was born in london in      in the year      he was made a clerk to the south sea company in which post he remained three years but having a strong propensity to the stage he first appeared in public on the theater in bath in      and in two years probation he made such a progress that the manager of lincolnsinnfields theater invited him to join his company where he continued two years more from thence he went to try his fortune in ireland where his merit soon brought him into the management  during his stay there he married the daughter of mr and mrs lydal persons that made very good figures in the theater this gentlewoman died in childbed very young leaving behind her one son born in his fathers house on the northstrand who is now an actor in this kingdom some years after mr giffard married a second wife who is now alive she has an amiable person and is a wellesteemed actress both in tragedy and comedy born if am not misinformed by her mother the widow lydal in the year       mr giffard and spouse if i mistake not came over to england    0 where they supported a company of comedians then under the management of mr odell now deputylicenser of plays under the lord chamberlain his grace the duke of grafton mr odell from not understanding the management of a company as indeed how should any one that is not in some sort brought up to that knowledge soon left it to mr giffard that did who in the year      caused to be built an entire new beautiful convenient theater by the same architect with that of covent garden where dramatic pieces were performed with the utmost elegance and propriety some years after he was obliged to quit that theater i may say by oppression and occupyd the vacant theater in lincolnsinnfields but his success did not answer his merit from thence he transplanted himself into the theater royal in drury lane  merit will sometimes fail of due regard and virtues self must be its own reward mr benjamin husband was born in pembrokeshire january      his ancestors were an ancient and reputable family long seated in that county he fell in love with the tragic muse very young but dangled after the drama full two years sighing at great expense before he was suffered to declare his passion publicly yet certainly he possessed most of the requisites that compound a good actor to assure success but the managers of those theatrical days were very cautious in their proceedings no persons were fit for their stages without a visible appearance at least of not displeasing and yet it was with some difficulty he gained permission to personate sir walter ralegh in the earl of essex but he came off so well that the following payday he received a weeks salary the usual stipend of young actors ten shillings a week but unluckily the death of good queen mary put a stop to their acting for near six months however when permission was given to open the theaters again mr husband soon gained better parts and a larger salary  in the year      mr dogget this truly great comedian was born in castlestreet dublin a circumstance overlooked by the laureat he left his occupation as an actor several years before his death and in his will bequeathed to watermenshall a sum for ever sufficient to buy a coat and silver badge to be rowed for on the thames by prentices every year that have fulfilled their indentures a humorous poet wrote the following lines upon the occasion on a glass window at lambeth the first of august       tom dogget the greatest sly drole in his parts in acting was certain a master of arts a monument left  no herald is fuller his praise is sung yearly by many a sculler ten thousand years hence if the world lasts so long tom dogget will still be the theme of their song old noll with great lewis and bourbon forgot and numberless kings in oblivion shall rot   being then in ireland recommended mr husband to mr ashbury as a very promising young actor and fit for his purpose he set out from london with mr trefusis i have mentioned jo trefusis before but shall add something here which i have learned from mr husband jo was reputed the natural son of oliver cromwell but i must own he did not seem to have any resemblance of features with his father if we may judge by the pictures and gravings of the protector jo had a long chin and naturally a most consummate foolish face by nature formed for suitable characters yet a person of infinite humor and shrewd conceits with a particular tone of voice and manner that gave a double satisfaction to what he said adhering strictly to honesty without guile or falsehood which i suppose he inherited from his mother he acquired the appellative from all that knew him of honest jo a character he bore with justice jo by the following account of himself must have been very young on the stage he entered a volunteer on board the ship where the duke of york commanded in the chanel in that memorable seaengagement with the dutch fleet commanded i think by van tromp in the year      when the preparations were making for the battle jo though a volunteer confessed fear began to invade him but when the man at the topmast head cried a sail then two sail and after zounds a whole wood jos terrors augmented but his fears came to the full height when a sailor asked him if he had not performed on the stage jo replied in the affirmative why then replied the blunt tarr tomorrow if you are not killed the first broadside by g  d you will see the deepest and bloodiest tragedy you ever saw in your life  jo was so inimitable in dancing the clown that general ingoldsby was so well pleased that he sent him five guineas from the box where he sat jo dressed himself next day and went to the castle to return thanks the general was hard to be persuaded it was the same person but jo soon convinced him by saying ise the very mon ant please your excellencey and at the same time twirling his hat as he did in the dance with his consummate foolish face and scrape nay now i am convinced replied the general laughing and thou shall not show such a face for nothing here  so gave jo five guineas more which so well please him that he paid his compliments in his awkward clownish manner and as shakespeare says set the table on a roar so exit jo    and embarked for ireland and was at sea in that violent storm when brigadier fitzgerald was cast away in the packetboat near hoath where every souperished but the master of the vessel however after much difficulty and great danger he landed safe in dublin mr husband continued on the stage with great reputation as an actor and a gentleman of exact conduct an example truly worthy imitating  he afterward passed and repassed from england to ireland several times till in the year      he was settled in this kingdom for i believe the remaining part of his days fixed in the esteem of all that know him  the lees of life with cheerfulness he wears and from an upright mind no death he fears mr charles hulet this person performed one season on the dublin stage he was born in the year   0  and was by his father put prentice to a bookseller by reading of plays in his masters shop he used to repeat speeches in the kitchen in the evening to the destruction of many a chair which he substituted in the room of real persons in his drama one night as he was repeating the part of alexander with his wooden representative of clytus an old elbowchair and coming to the speech where the old general is to be killed this young mock alexander snatched a poker instead of a javelin and threw it with such strength against poor clytus that the chair was killed upon the spot and lay mangled on the floor the death of clytus made a monstrous noise which disturbed the master in the parlour who called out to know the reason and was answered by the cook below nothing sir but that alexander has killed clytus  his master mr edmund curll mr curll was a person of extraordinary talents very pleasing in conversation and could extract gold from dirt he had the art of forming a title to a book beyond the rest of the craft or even the author themselves i have forgot how he came to stumble over mr pope for mr curll was a little purblind and lost his sight some years before his death but mr pope in revenge invited him to a tavern under the color of friendship sack being a favorite liquor with mr curll this great poet had a draught prepares in an antimonial cup which the unsuspecting book seller cheerfully drank off to the health of his good friend mr pope but the operation began to work before he could reach his own house with such violen motions that the intended farce was near ending in the tragedy of mr edmund curll the next day to complete his revenge mr pope published a humourous account of the murder of mr curll by poison by this poet and bookseller to their deaths declared fe war against each other and though the latter might b put to his shifts sometimes yet he often found meat to gall his kibe pope in his dunciad had made cur a demihero and has filthily bedaubd him with honors but enraged wit like a wasp disturbed w fly at harmless passengers and leave their poisoned sting behind a person well noted in london from mr pope commencing physician finding his inclination so strong for the stage agreed to let him try his fortune there he had a most extraordinary melodious voice strong and clear and in the part of macheath in the beggar opera he was allowed to excel the original then he was an excellent mimic if excellency may be joined to mimicry he took a little too much pride in the firmness of his voice for he had an odd custom of stealing unperceived upon a person and with a hem in his ear deafen him for some time with the strength and loudness of his voice yet this customary folly for folly it may be justly called proved his fate for the last hem he gave broke a bloodvessel which was the cause of his death in twentyfour hours after he was a great benefactor to the malttax which in my opinion was the cause of that mountain of flesh he was loaded with  at the time of his death he was under mr henry giffard at the theater in goodmansfields he was buried at the charge of that gentleman in st marys church whitechapel in the   th year of his age we shall end with mr hulet in mr giffards own words  mr charles hulet was endowed with great abilities for a player but labored under the disadvantage of a person rather too corpulent for the hero or the lover but his port well became henry the eighth falstaff etc and many other characters both tragedy and comedy in which he would have been equally excellent had his application and figure been proportionable to his qualifications which had he duly cultivated he would have become a very considerable performer what machines are we poor mortals that a person should be killed with a hem  as in a watch if the least engine flies the work is stopped and the whole movement dies mr benjamin johnson commonly called ben johnson was bre a painter where his employment led him to paint under his master the scenes for the stage but he took more pleasure in hearing the actors rehearse than in his pencil or colors and as he used to say in his merry mood left the saint s st luke was a painter and those that follow that art have chosen him for their patron and make his day a time of mirth and jollity occupation to take that of a sinner  he arrived to as great a perfection in acting as his great namesake did in poetry he seemed to be proud to wear that eminent poets double name being more particularly great in all that authors plays that were usually performed viz wasp in the play of bartholomewfair corbaccio in the fox morose in the silent woman and ananias in the alchymist  he was but once in this kingdom about fifty years ago in the summer season i have heard him often give most extravagant praises to one baker a masterpaver in dublin for excelling in sir john falstaff the spanish friar sir epicure mammon in the alchymist and many other parts he would be studying in the streets while he would be overlooking his men at their work one day two of his men that were newly come under their master and were strangers to his manner observing his countenance motions gestures and talking to himself imagined their master was mad baker seeing his men neglect their work to gaze at him bid them in a hasty manner mind their business the countryfellows for they but lately came from chester went to work again but still with an eye upon their master the part was sir john falstaff that baker was rehearsing and when he came to the fifth act where the humourous knight is supposed to see sir walter blunt lie dead upon the stage  he gives a look on one of his new pavers and muttered loud enough to be heard with eyes fixed upon him  who have we here  sir walter blunt  there is honor for you the fellow that was stooping rose on the instant clapping hold of his master  wauns ise blunt enough to take care of you ise warrant you so with the help of his companion they bound mr bakers hands and feet assisted by other people no wiser than themselves and notwithstanding their masters noise and struggle they carried him home in that condition with a great mob at their heels mr johnson informed me when he returned to england he gave mr betterton the manner of bakers playing falstaff which that great actor not only approved of but imitated and allowed the manner was better than his own mr husband gave me much the same account of this mr baker  mr johnson played to the last year of his life with the same standard reputation and died in august      in the   th year of his age  he fell like autumn fruit that mellowd long even wondered at because he dropped no sooner oedipus miss j jones the father of this young gentlewoman was born in wales a branch of an ancient and reputable family in that country but an unforeseen misfortune falling upon him he made the stage his refuge and governed a country company many years with judgment honesty and reputation miss jones more by the will of her father than her own inclinations was thrust on the stage a mere infant and now makes a very good figure there but her virtue and sober discreet behavior may be a pattern for imitation therefore i shall say no more but conclude that she deserves a better fate  our guardian angel is fair innocence and virtuous actions are our best defense mr theophilus keen i mention this gentleman as receiving instructions from the late joseph ashbury esquire mr keen was an excellent scholar and a very good actor but having some share in the government of the theater in lincolnsinnfields under mr rich either for the want of performers or perhaps overlooking his talents a fault sometimes very good actors of both sexes are guilty of he stood for parts something out of his road as oroonoko earl of essex edgar in king lear when in the part of gloucester in the same play and others of that cast no actor of his time could excel him although a very good figure and voice his person wanted elegance for the soft characters  it was reported the ill success of the theater when he was sharer in profit and loss broke his heart he died in the year      and was buried in the body of the church of st clementdanes by a voluntary subscription from both houses it was what we term in england a walking funeral and there were upwards of two hundred persons in deep mourning his life was published by mr savage illegitimate son to the earl of rivers several woudbe wits wrote copies of verses upon his death one i remember ending with this line and death was found too sharp for keen   mr laurence kennedy this gentleman is a native of ireland born in dublin his good figure agreeable voice and genteel easy carriage render him a pleasing actor and we may expect from such qualifications that time may bring him to great perfection all arts are learned by time observation and industry and when choice guides youth in any occupation nature seems to lead the way  but many blunder on in various ways some ill succeed while others merit praise mr john leigh i think was born in ireland he commenced actor however on the irish theater he was a person of some education with a particular amiable form and genteel address insomuch that he gained the appellative of handsome leigh a good figure was the chief advantage in the parts he performed he was called from this kingdom to fill up the troop of comedians raised to garrison the new theater in lincolnsinnfields in the year      at its first opening where he set forth the first night in captain plume in the recruiting officer which occasioned the following lines to be wrote on the back of one of their bills it is right to raise recruits for faith they are wanted for not one acting soldiers here it is granted   mr leigh i believe might have been in the good graces of the fairsex if his taste had led him that way he was addicted to poetry and produced a comedy called kensingtongardens acted at the theater in lincolnsinnfields in the year    0 which walked consumptively six nights and then expired he also trimmed up a farce called hobs wedding taken from a comedy called the country wake written by that perfect comedian mr thomas dogget he has wrote several humourous songs here follows a sample which as it is a theatrical anecdote will require a little illustration by way of notes  to the tune of thomas i cannot my scandalous neighbors of portugalstreet portugalstreet where the theater in lincolnsinnfields is built  come listen awhile to my ditty i will sing you a song though my voice be not sweet and that you will say is a pity as merry a sonnet as times can afford of egleton mr egleton commonly called baron egleton for taking that title upon him in france where he squandered away a small patrimony his person was perfectly genteel and a very pleasing actor but through a wild road of life he finished his journey in the   th year of his age  walker b mr walker the original macheath vide the account of his life  jack hall mr john hall a sharer in old smock alley theater above thirty years ago he went from hence with mr leigh to the new theater in lincolnsinnfields he was something too corpulent and a thickness of speech that might be mimicd with ease which adds some humor to this ballad he understood music and was once a dancing master and the original lockit in the beggars opera  and my lord my lord a young nobleman weak in intellects title and estates do not always inherit wisdom  if you doubt of the truth to confirm every word i will call for a witness  will thomas will thomas a waiter at a coffeehouse in portugalstreet overagainst the stagedoor a person in understanding pretty near upon a par with my lord  i will call for a witness  will thomas ii first egleton coaxd the fool over the way the young lord  with sentences sweeter than honey a toad in a hole a cant word for any baked meat with a pudding was their dinner that day and my noodle he lent them his money what though i have got by him many a crown what i never can forgive him is that he came down five guineas the night ere he went out of town is this true or no  o yes says will thomas o yes etc iii tom walker his creditors meaning to chouse like an honest goodnatured young fellow resolved all the summer to stay in the house and rehearse by himself massianello massianello a play or rather two plays on the rebellion of naples by thomas anello a fisherman of that city who was near subverting the government having the whole power and command in his hands for several days but plunging himself into wine instead of his element of water he at last ended his life and mock reign in a ditch mr walker took some pains that summer to contract the two plays into one which was performed the following winter with some success the two plays were originally written by mr thomas durfey  as soon as he heard of the barons success mr egleton received the five guineas from the lord  he stripped off his nightgown and put on his dress and cried d  mn my b  d i will strike for no less so he called over the hatch the hatch of the stagedoor the bounds of those theatrical princes that might receive four pounds a week and by their industry make shift to spend six a great virtue in some theatrical gentry for will thomas will thomas so he called etc iv go tell my young lord says this modest young man i beg he would invite me to dinner i will be as diverting as ever i can i will by the faith of a sinner i mimic all actors the worst and the best i will sing him a song i will crack

be supposed to be made by the woman that kept the coffeehouse  i cried out my lord fie upon you to us youre as hard as a turk or a jew if you part with your money pay where it is due poor bettys betty

customers etc reflections of the coffeewoman  poor bettys misfortune is pitied by all who expects every moment in pieces to fall though she swears it is my lords twas got by jack hall or else by poor sneaking will thomas will thomas or else etc the author died in      the   th year of his age  a time that should to true perfection tend but many promise well that never mend mr lewis layfield was born in england has been in many employments both by sea and land and was formerly very active and strong able to go through fatigues as i do not know the offices he bore in the service i must be silent on that head i remember him in drury lane when i was in my youth a nimble active scaramouch before he was laden with that burden of flesh he now carries about him at that time he was such a person as his eldest son mr robert layfield appears at present who is a very good player in several cast of parts particularly sergeant kite etc  mr layfield has been a main pillar time past in supporting the dublin theater and therefore ought to be respected in his decline but he is happily engaged for life and of consequence if articles are binding will receive his salary to the day of his death there are several parts he might still perform with satisfaction as hob jobson and many others for the audience in wellesteemed actors will bate them something of their years for the service they have done i do not know whether that circumstance will have any weight with the managers here though it is an oldfashioned custom in england but different nations different customs  it is said the natives of the cape goodhope it is a custom with the inland hottentots who are not under the eye of the dutch at the cape when they perceive their relations drooping with age and infirmities either to carry them into some distant wood for beasts to devour or end them by ax or halter at home and have a saying among them  no work no meat  when age is failing end it with a rope mr william milward this gentleman was born at lichfield in staffordshire the   th of september in the year   0  his great grandfather sir thomas milward was chief justice of westchester and raised a troop of horse in defense of that unhappy monarch king charles the first and was then a county palatine which occasioned the rump parliament in the year      to vote their charter void and i do not find it ever restored the family were originally from derbyshire the father of our actor a few years after the birth of his son removed to uttoxeter commonly called tociter in the county of stafford distant from london     measured miles formerly a colony of the romans  he had his education in a school of that town accounted one of the best in that part of the country at fifteen his father brought him to london where he was put apprentice to an eminent apothecary in norfolkstreet in the strand but he has often declared there were so many dangers in the employment that he could never like it the following accident made him determine to leave it  he was ordered by his master to carry his prescriptions to a gentleman and lady ill of different maladies at the same time the labels were wrong directed but he did not discover this mistake till the next day when he carried other medicines to the same persons and by his judgment in the operation soon found out the mistake he was greatly terrified but for fear of more he let fall the phial he had in his hand as by accident ran back to his master and told him what had been done the master ordered more proper doses the patients recovered and all was well  mr milwards first essay in acting was among young gentlemen privately for their own diversion in a small time after he mixed with a country company of comedians where his merit shone so bright that it opened the eyes of the manager in lincolnsinnfields with whom he rose in that theater and covent garden to be placed in the foremost rank of perfection he died in the  0th year of his age in the very meridian of an actor then belonging to the theater in drury lane  mr milward shall make his exit from this worldly stage with an epilogue spoke for the benefit of his widow which will better speak his excellencies  when roscius died each generous roman wept while ciceros deathless page his plaudit kept such was the harvest in that golden age who toiled to till the vineyard of the stage the romans wept more generous britons ye dry up the tears of milwards family your bounteous cares beyond the grave extend lo what a scene dead merit to befriend for merit sure he shared in every part merit most rare  integrity of heart whatever of friendly generous good he played in scenes of real life he still displayed young hamlets sable when he chose to wear young hamlets filial piety was there when the fond lover phocyas in the siege of damascus phocyas was his part each tender line sprang glowing from his heart or when macduffs dire anguish was his theme the husband and the father bled in him well might he please when with each virtuous thought the poet penned the players breast was fraught such milward was as such his early grave calls down the pity of the fair and brave cut off just at the noontide of his days just when he hoped to have deserved your praise the player steeled to counterfeit the tear distills an undissembled eyedrop here whilst by this splendid circle fired his breast with emulation burns and claims his best that his own manes may like milwards rest mr charles macklin was born in the kingdom of ireland but left that country very young he cast his thoughts toward the stage in england in his early years the science of acting is not to be learned without great labor and study and not copying any performer that went before him he has at length shone out a finished original i never knew him undertake any part but as in painting i found some strokes of nature that gave fresh touches to the picture he was drawing  he rose gradually in the theatrical corpse like the late northern star of russia till he came to be chief leader he regularly gained the topmast step and now is seated in the throne of perfection dispensing laws to that part of the province where the sock is worn where he reigns sole monarch and deservedly so since with long laborious pains he has found out the true rule of reigning shylock the jew in the merchant of venice is so immitably counterfeited that we cannot say more than what a gentleman said extempore on seeing him perform the part this is the jew that shakespeare drew   this excellent comedian is author of a play called henry the viith or the popish impostor acted at the theater royal in drury lane the story of perkin warbeck the piece in my judgment is wellplannd the diction is not considered critically but no wonder since he was put upon the subject and had but six weeks from the first line in writing to the first night in acting the following oneact pieces have been performed with great success but not printed  a will or no will or a new case for the lawyers  a critic on the suspicious husband or the plague of envy  the fortunehunters or the widow bewitched  i shall conclude with two lines wrote b  a gentleman in this kingdom  this jew this colonel lopez ben has shown he makes each various character his own mrs macklin may by her judgment and execution in the parts she undertakes be equally ranked with the first class of actresses and in some articles lead the way she never sets up for a heroine or attempts to appear in an improper light she knows the power of her own talents and always shines with unborrowd light without the danger of being eclipsed her propriety in dress for the various characters she performs is another excellence that most of her cotemporaries either pass over with very little regard or not enough  in my theatrical course of above thirty years i have not seen her equal in many parts viz the widow blackacre in wycherlys plaindealer mrs day in the committee widow lackit in southerns oroonoko lady pliant in congreves doubledealer doris in aesop by sir john vanbrugh mrs amelet in the confederacy by the same author lady wishfort in the way of the world and a number of other characters that are wrote in the true spirit of comedy but a vessel need not fail of arriving at the desired port with the care of so good a pilot  we may find by these two examples that ireland has produced as complete comedians as her sister england but i shall give a few lines the sentiments of a young gentleman in this city  to mrs macklin while macklin charms the listening throng a nobler subject warms my song of natures sacred name i would sing from whom her various beauties spring the swelling sense  the genial fire the nameless graces we admire to her  she frankly did impart a clue  to trace the mazy heart she gave her wit  with graceful ease and every attribute to please but know  thou finished nymph  to you nor wonder  nor applause  is due for charms  which nature only drew mr john morris was born in this kingdom i understand his first entrance on the stage was under the conduct of mrs violante with her he traveled to england and by various changes has been in most of the theaters in london as well as dublin there are several old mens parts that he masterly executes he sings passingly is esteemed a good teague and an excellent pierrot he has a brother of the same calling  dancing is certainly one of the appendages to education that few polite people would be without yet if it mends the manners it does not always mend the mind but as othello says   it is not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are most virtuous mr charles morgan was born in london in the year      his father and mother both belonging to the stage at his birth the son played the childrens parts as soon as he could speak plain he came into this kingdom in the year      with his parents where he made a great progress in what is called low comedy and gave great hopes of perfection if a lingering consumptioh had not taken him off in the flower of his age i fear he took a little too much freedom with his constitution and by perseverance made shift to get the better of it he died in may      in the   th year of his age the last part he performed was beau clincher in the constant couple being the first time of mr sherridans appearing in the character of sir harry wildair where mr morgan notwithstanding his ill habit of body like a taper in its last blaze gave a brighter flame than all that shone before this was november though he lingered on till the may following  thus manly health is often overcome when its worst woe is to be found at home mr mozeen i think i know enough of him to imagine he is a very improving actor he has many requisites that may make out what i assert for him a good person joined to a genteel education judgment voice and understanding his success already since he has had but three years experience shows us a larger prospect of advantage  he was born in england though of french extraction and if it is any honor to him had the muchtalkdof dr henry sachevere for a sponsor  mrs mozeen formerly miss edwards knew a child she sprung up under the car of that eminent actress mrs clive i know mrs mozeen is an adept in music has a charming manner and voice if her innate modesty keeps her back as an actress time may get the better of her timidity modesty may assume a proper spirit when it is assured of being justly right in what is undertaken for virtue has ever courage and is its own guardian  virtue could see to do what virtue would by her own radiant light though sun and moon were in the flat sea sunk milton mr william mynitt this gentleman was born of a good family at weobly in herefordshire in the year    0 where he received a good schoo education he was sent to london very young to be put into business but his friends or rather relations who often prove our greates enemies neglecting his fortune he turned hi thoughts to the drama however he had no the vanity of most of the theatrical young heroes who jump at once into your othello oroonoko hamlet or captain plume but wisely weighing his own talents stepped into the part of polonius in hamlet where he gained such applause that he resolved to put on the sock with which he walked an easy pace in the right road to perfection  his first trial of skill was at the theater in the haymarket commonly called the french house where he gave such strokes of judgment that alarmed his best antagonists from his beginning encouragement he was solicited to add a promising member to the company of bath where there is a regular theater and an audience as difficult to be pleased as that in london being generally persons of the highest rank that frequent those diversions in the capital he had the good fortune to give satisfaction there insomuch that several persons of distinction and taste promised to recommend him to one of the established theaters in london but a company that season setting out for ireland he was resolved to accompany them and cultivate his genius in this kingdom his knowledge in music is some addition to his merit and in his walk of acting he may keep pace with the best on both sides the water  i never saw mrs mynitt perform any part but as she has an amiable person and excellent voice i have taken it upon trust that she is an agreeable actress both in tragedy and comedy but the bulk of the letters in the bills are the distinguished characteristics of merit it puts me in memory of a mandarin i saw at canton in china who was lifted on a throne of state to public view while a dozen of his slaves that bore him in triumph through the streets were covered with a curtain and no more of their persons seen but the regular steps of their feet  in every region it is a maxim tried custom in spite of reason will preside mr henry norris alias jubilee dicky this natural comedian was born in salisbury court in      near the spot where the theater was afterward erected that went by the name of dorsetgarden theater it being in queen elizabeths days the gardens of the palace belonging to the earl of dorset he played on the irish stage in      though a diminutive figure there were many parts that he excelled in viz barnaby brittle in the wanton wife etc i remember when mr norris was in his decline mr cibber se made some alterations in the play and performed the part himself mrs oldfield tha of mrs brittle but she complained she couk not perform it with that spirit with him as she did with little norris as she called him when asked her the reason she replied cuckold did not sit so easy on cibber s figure as it di upon that of norris s who seemed formed by nature to be one  the mother of this little great comedian was one of the first women that came on the stage as an actress for some time after the restoration of king charles the second young smoothfaced men performed the womens parts that humourous monarch coming before his usual time to shakespeares hamlet sent the facetious earl of rochester to know the reason of their delay who brought word back that the queen was not quite shaved ods fish his usual expression i beg her majestys pardon well wait till her barber has done with her  mr norris married mrs knapton the sister of the late mr wilkss first wife by whom he had several children the females are since dead and resembled the mother in stature she being a very personable woman but the sons copied the father our jubilee dicky which nickname came for his inimitable humourous performance of a part so called in the constant couple or a trip to the jubilee  he spoke tragedy exceedingly knowing in the different passions though he never performed any part of the serious cast for notwithstanding his judgment on the london theaters his figure must have made the sentiments ridiculous after the death of that celebrated author mr addison the merry mr penkethman at his theater at richmond there are two richmonds in england one in yorkshire that gives the title to that illustrious family the other richmond is ten miles from london it may rank with some cities in england for its extent but i know of none that can equal it in its fine situation upon the noble river thames its healthful air beautiful various prospects from the hill and its increasing noble buildings  played the tragedy of cato or rather defiled those noble sentiments of liberty out of such merry mouths norris was ridiculously dressed for cato penkethman juba low comedians for the other characters and the two ladies supplied by men of the same cast yet a blind man might have borne with norris in the roman patriot for he spoke it with all the solemnity of a suffering hero while penkethman and the rest of the motley tribe made it as ridiculous by humor and action and yet some of the first rank in the kingdom seemed highly diverted whilst others invoked the manes of the dead roman and briton to rise and avenge their own cause i remember the next morning the following four lines were pasted on the door of the playhouse  while greatness hears such language spoke where godlike freedoms made a joke let such mean souls be never free to taste the sweets of liberty an illustrious nobleman who had a seat near richmond seeing several people reading the lines as he was riding up the hill stopped and perused them and said in his usual grave manner  i wish the poetry had been better  mr norris died in the   th year of his age his eldest son may be remembered here as an actor some few years ago on old smockalley stage but neither he nor his brother who has likewise troubled several country stages in england resembled the father in any thing but stature  great nature differs in the human race some worthless stems the parentroots disgrace mrs anne oldfield the reason why i have thrust this celebrated actress into my account may be learned by the following epistle  dublin may the   th sir we find by the newspapers you intend to give us the history of the stage it is desired by several that you would be pleased to add mrs oldfield to the number though we are all assured she never was in this kingdom we know the task is in your power and you will oblige many that have a regard for you  yours etc   every art has its origin but when brought to full perfection it is often in danger of decaying and sometimes of being quite lost in oblivion painting on glass in this age is but a faint copy of our forefathers in that art and the perdurable cement of our ancient castles etc is now unknown the sun sets to rise again but oldfields light is lost for ever  i was too young to view her first dawn on the stage but yet had the infinite satisfaction of her meridian luster a glow of charms not to be beheld but with a trembling eye which held her influence till set in night  mr farquhar as i have been informed by herself brought her first to shine in public he accidentally at a tavern kept by a near relation of mrs oldfields heard a person reading a comedy in a room behind the bar with such a just vivacity and humor of the characters as gave him infinite surprise and satisfaction his curiosity was too prevalent to observe the height of good manners therefore he made a pretense to go into the room where he was struck dumb for some time with her figure and blooming beauty but was more astonished at her discourse and sprightly wit mr farquhar pressed her to pursue her amusement but was obliged to depart without that satisfaction  mr wilks was at that time in ireland therefore he took some pains to acquaint sir john vanbrugh who had some share in the theater with the jewel he had found thus by accident it was some time before she would be prevailed upon though she has merrily told me i longed to be at it and only wanted a little decent entreaties  alinda in the pilgrim was the first part she was taken notice of in which sir john vanbrugh altered and revived upon her account which is a character of different species of passions and variety where she charmed the play into a run of many succeeding nights  i remember in her full round of glory in comedy she used to slight tragedy she would often say i hate to have a page dragging my tail about why do they not give porter these parts she can put on a better tragedy face than i can when mithridates was revived it was with much difficulty she was prevailed upon to take the part but she performed it to the utmost length of perfection and after that she seemed much better reconciled to tragedy what a majestical dignity in cleopatra and indeed in every part that required it such a finished figure on the stage was never yet seen in calista the fair penitent she was inimitable in the third act with horatio when she tears the letter with   to atoms thus thus let me tear the vile detested falsehood the wicked lying evidence of shame her excellent clear voice of passion her piercing flaming eye with manner and action suiting used to make me shrink with awe and seemed to put her monitor horatio into a mousehole i almost gave him up for a troublesome puppy and though mr booth played the part of lothario i could hardly lug him up to the importance of triumphing over such a finished piece of perfection that seemed to be too much dignified to lose her virtue  even her amors seemed to lose that glare which appears round the persons of the failing fair neither was it ever known that she troubled the repose of any ladys lawful claim and was far more constant than millions in the conjugal noose  she was of a superior height but with a lovely proportion and the dignity of her soul equal to her form and stature made up of benevolent charity affable and goodnatured to all that deserved it mr savage son to the earl rivers when he was persecuted by his unnatural mother received from her evergiving bountiful hand fifty pounds a year during her life and she was with mr wilks a main means in saving him from an ignominious end  the part of sophonisba a tragedy by mr thomson famed for many excellent poems was reputed the cause of her death for in her execution she went beyond wonder to astonishment from that time her decay came slowly on and never left her till it conducted her to eternal rest the   d of october    0 she left several charitable legacies and very handsome fortunes to her two sons but let us see what better writers say of this phoenix of the stage o that we might have another from her ashes  you may read if you please what a french author has wrote on this inimitable actress as well as some touches on our english drama  sir roger mostings baronet was passionately in love with a famous actress called mrs oldfield and notwithstanding her indifference and even bad usage could not be cured  he being at supper with us when his disgrace and banishment were notified to him his greatest concern was for his mistress whom he must abandon his grief and love made him shed tears his order bore that he should retire to his estate the next day and therefore as the last remedy for his love he proposed instant marriage to mrs oldfield which produced no other effect than a mortifying refusal we may gather from this author that the passage mentioned was in the year      when the rebel lords suffered death and lord nithisdale made his escape from the tower disguised by his lady in her habit sir roger mostings then commander in the fourth troop of lifeguards spoke too freely in favor of the imprisoned noblemen that were concerned in the rebellion and therefore was ordered to leave the court and retire to his estate as also the earl of nottingham the earl of ailesford the lords finche and guernsey my lord portmore the earl of orkney lord windsor and many others all deprived of their posts and places with the same orders to retire to their estates sir roger was esteemed one of the handsomest men in the kingdom witty wellbred and had a great estate which proves that mrs oldfield despised interest and would not give her hand without her heart  this amiable woman was admitted with pleasure into the company of ladies of the first rank for birth and virtue who seemed to take her visits as an honor done them it must be owned she is an incomparable sweet girl she reconciled me to the english stage her voice her shape and all her actions so charmed me that i made the more haste to learn the language that i might understand her  the english are passionately fond of dramatic entertainments and i doubt if france can produce so many excellent works of this kind as britain and i have seen some superior to greece or rome they have their shakespeare dryden otway congreve cibber farquhar and a numerous train of excellent tragic and comic poets that have the force of moving the soul with their energy of sentiments and expression far beyond the ancients  i shall conclude this account with an abstract of a copy of verses wrote by mr savage illegitimate son to earl rivers though the author of that unfortunate gentlemans life seems to deny it i suppose because his name is not in the title page but first her epitaph  hic juxta requiescit tot inter poetarum laudata nomina anna oldfield nec ipsa minore laud digna quippe quae eorum opera in scenam quoties prodivit illustravit semper and nobilitavit nunquam ingenium idem ad parts diversissimas habilius fuit ita tamen ut ad singulas non facta sed nata esse videretur in tragoediis formae splendour oris dignitas incessus majestas tanta vocis suavitate temperabantur ut nemo esset tam agrestis tam durus spectator quin in admirationem totus raperetur in comoedia autem tanta vis tam venusta hilaritas tam curiosa felicitas ut neque sufficerent spectando oculi neque plaudendo manus in english thus  near this among the celebrated poets rests the body of anne oldfield herself not less deserving to be celebrated for whenever on the stage her action illustrated and ennobled their compositions never was one genius so adapted to the most different parts she seemed born for each distinct in tragedy her noble presence elevated speech and majestic gait tempered with so peculiar sweetness of voice never failed to transport the most rustic and insensible into admiration in comedy she discovered such a happy air such a sprightly and becoming gaiety and so delicate an address that neither eyes were satisfied with seeing nor hands weary of applauding a poem to the memory of mrs anne oldfield oldfields no more and can the muse forbear over oldfields grave to shed a grateful tear shall she the glory of the british stage pride of her sex and wonder of the age shall she who living charmed the admiring throng die undistinguished and not claim a song no feeble as it is i will boldly raise my willing voice to celebrate her praise and with her name immortalize my lays had but my muse her art to touch the soul charm every sense and every power control i would paint her as she was  the form divine where every lovely grace united shine a mien majestic as the wife of jove an air as winning as the queen of love in every feature rival charms should rise and cupid hold his empire in her eyes a soul with every elegance refined by nature and the converse of mankind wit which could strike assuming folly dead and sense which tempered every thing she said judgment which every little fault could spy but candor that would pass a thousand by such finished breeding so polite a taste her fancy always for the fashion past whilst every social virtue fired her breast to help the needy succor the distressed a friend to all in misery she stood and her chief pride was placed in doing good but now my muse the arduous task engage and show the charming figure on the stage describe her look her action voice and mien the gay coquet soft maid or haughty queen so bright she shone in every different part she gained despotic empire over the heart knew how each various motion to control sooth every passion and subdue the soul as she or gay or sorrowful appears she claims our mirth or triumphs in our tears when cleopatras form she chose to wear we saw the monarchs mien the beautys air charmed with the sight her cause we all approve and like her lover give up all for love antonys fate instead of caesars choose and wish for her we had a world to lose but now the gay delightful scene is over and that sweet form must glad our world no more relentless death has stopped the tuneful tongue and closed those eyes for all but death too strong blasted that face where every beauty bloomed and to eternal rest the graceful mover doomed mr pack in the remembrance of many was once on the stage in this kingdom to his no small terror for a storm at sea he told me frightened him so much that the anxiety of returning dwelt so strongly on his mind that he could not appear half himself to the public and to lessen his seavoyage back again he went to dunaghadee in the north of ireland and embarked for scotland verifying the old proverb the farthest way about is the nearest way home  he first came upon the stage as a singer and being as they say a smockfacd youth used to sing the female parts in dialogues with that great master mr leveridge who has so many years charmed with his manly voice but mr pack was excellent in many parts as marplot in the busy body beau maiden in tunbridgewalks beau mizen in the fair quaker of deal etc indeed nature seemed to mean him for those sort of characters he had such an antipathy to the water that he would sooner choose to go from the haymarket to lambeth round the bridge than just cross in a boat i heard a certain peer as much famed for his wit as his principles who died in the service of spain ask pack if he would go with him to france for a month yes replied mr pack if your grace will get a bridge built from dover to calais for gads curse me if i ever set my foot over salt water again  mr pack left the stage in the meridian of life and set up a a tavern the globe near charing cross over against the haymarket where he died having no wife or issue i know not any relation he left behind to lament his death  had transportation been this players doom conviction had brought sudden death at home mr william phillips harlequin this extraordinary person was born in wales though he never knew one word of his mother tongue neither did i ever hear of the schoolmistress that taught him english yet he got perfect in two parts and performed them both with applause viz the welsh collier in the recruiting officer and the drunken colonel in the intriguing chambermaid but his great talent lay in the mimes and pantomimes though the art does not require much rhetoric yet they should have heads as well as heels  he was taught tumbling and slight of hand by that great master of arts the stupendous mr faux and outdid his master in several tricks and was very happy at invention in escaping to ireland this great man was taken up in london for suspicion of debt and dealt with the honest officer in the following manner he first called for liquor in abundance and treated all about him to the no small joy of the bailiff who was rejoiced to have a calf that bled so well as they term it harlequin made the honest bailiff believe he had six dozen of wine ready packed up which he would send for to drink while in custody and likewise allow him sixpence a bottle for drinking it in his own chamber shoulderdab listened to the proposal with pleasure the bailiff went to the place as directed and returned with joy to hear that it should be sent in the morning early accordingly it came by a porter sweating under his load the turnkey called to his master and told him the porter and hamper were come in very well says he then let nothing but the porter and hamper out the porter performed his part very well came heavily in with an empty hamper and seemed to go lightly out with philips on his back he was dishamperd at an alehouse near the waterside crossed the thames and soon after embarked for ireland he was very fond of this trick and would take pride in his project which was contrived long before he was taken to be ready on such an emergency when this scheme was concerted with the porter he made this threatening speech to him g  d strike me plump his usual speech if you are not as secret as the sun at noonday i will broil you and eat you alive you dog exit phillips  where he became a sharer in smockalley till he with his namesake broke the fraterhood he was the first projector of the theater in capelstreet neither was he much to blame in this since a sort of manager for the proprietors who knew as much of the matter as a journeyman tailor does of bellfounding by his inimitable rhetoric persuaded his employers that he and his wife had too much salary and yet the next season gave twenty times the sum to prevent their playing yet phillips opened and got money but to show his dexterity he played a harlequin trick and in one of his deceits made his escape with his wife he had here who was no bad actress back to england but did not forget to take more money than his own along with him  traveling is chargeable but capelstreet theater has been since occupied and is still ready on all occasions  thus juglers tricks are formed to cheat the eyes and knaves have found the art to trick the wise mrs pasqualino was a very sightly actress with a good voice i have forgot her maiden name which she first changed for ravenscroft an actor i am told of some merit after his demise being musically inclined she tied her fate to signor pasqualino an italian eminent for his great talents that way she has left the stage to follow the fortune of her spouse and i have been informed they were both lately in holland wherever he is he cannot fail of reward from his merit for music has charms to sooth a savage breast to soften rocks and bend the knotted oak   i shall conclude with mrs pasqualino by inserting a few lines of a poet on her leaving the stage though some poets like some painters do not draw exact likenesses and are too prone to flattery  adieu unspotted excellence adieu chaste spite of censure spite of envy true  mature in judgment far above thy age and what is more wondrous virtuous on the stage ah yet return nor rob us of delight continue still to ravish with thy sight whether in desdemonas tender strain or softer belvidera you complain or in monimia force the pitying tear or in the airs of millamant appear or lady betty modish you impart in characters assumed a real dart receive this plaudit from the admiring muse nor tribute to thy merit paid refuse  and must we then the loss of thee deplore shall we then see thy lovely face no more adieu  the stage is nearly its decline since we must thee the boast of it resign mr james quin this great and just actor was born in king street covent garden the   th of february      though numbers believe he owes his birth to ireland his ancestors were of an ancient family in this kingdom his grandfather alderman mark quin was lord mayor of the city of dublin in the year      in the reign of king charles the second the father of our roscius received a liberal education in trinity college dublin from thence he went over to lincolns inn to finish his studies where he was called to the bar but at the death of his father who left him a plentiful estate he returned with his son then an infant to take possession  mr james quin was educated under the care of dr jones of dublin a person eminent for learning till the death of his father in the year    0 mr quin was undoubted heir to his estate but through his youth and inexperience of the courts a suit of law hung so long in chancery till he unenabled to carry the cause farther was obliged to drop it for want of proper assistance i am informed a powerful guider of the law was his antagonist and a person has but a bad chance to fight a duel with a fencingmaster  our eminent actor first appeared on the stage in old smockalley in the part of abel in the committee i must take some little pride when i declare i imagine myself the first that persuaded him not to smother his rising genius in this kingdom where at that time there was no great encouragement for merit and try his fortune in london whither by his kind and evertoberememberd recommendation i soon followed him  it is in some sort a hardship to a rising genius in the first entrance to a regular established company the parts are all supplied and like underofficers in an army they must wait for preserment or do something extraordinary before they can expect it an accident fell out that gave our young actor a happy opportunity  the managers had an order from the lord chamberlain to revive the play of tamerlane for the  th of november      which was got up with the utmost magnificence the third night the late mr mills who performed bajazet was taken suddenly ill and with much persuasion mr quin was prevailed upon to read the part which was thought a great undertaking for a young actor of his standing but to the mortification of several competitors he succeeded so well that the audience gave him their general applause through the whole course of the part the next night he made himself perfect and performed it with redoubled applauses of approbation and was complimented by several persons of distinction and dramatic taste upon his early rising genius  but as the theatrical world is a picture in miniature of the great envy will shake her snaky locks people of twice his age thought his progress a little too rapid for their approbation his temper took fire at the visible depression he bore it some time with temper but the first opportunity he engaged with mr rich in lincolnsinnfields where by just degrees he attained the highest round of perfection and not to take any merit from other performers was certainly the chief pillar that supported all the theaters wherever he has performed i will not take upon me to point out his excellencies in any particular part since he is excellent in all therefore i shall end with the immortal shakespeare he is a man take him for all in all i never shall look upon his like again   the great honor this gentleman has received from the second illustrious person in the kingdom in trusting the royal blood to his care will better speak his excellence than my weak skill can do  mr lacy ryan this gentleman was once in ireland with the celebrated mr quin and mrs clive in the year      he was born in england in the year      the first part he was taken notice of in was that of marcus in cato which was first acted in       in the run of that celebrated tragedy he was accidentally brought into a fray with some of our tritons on the thames and in the scuffle a blow on the nose was given him by one of these waterbullies who neither regard men nor manners i remember the same night as he was brought on the bier after his supposed death in the fourth act of cato the blood from the real wound in the face gushed out with violence that hurt had no other effect than just turning his nose a little though not to deformity yet some people imagine it gave a very small alteration to the tone of his voice though nothing disagreeable he acquitted himself in many capital parts both in tragedy and comedy to the satisfaction of his auditors and has been ever esteemed in the first rank of actors  some few years ago another unfortunate accident befell him as he was going home to his house after his nights performance he was attacked by a street robber and making resistance the villain shot a brace of pistolbullets into his mouth which broke some part of his jaw by the help of a lamp the robber knew mr ryan as i have been informed begged his pardon for his mistake and ran off of this hurt too he recovered after a long illness and played with success as before without any seeming alteration of voice or face his royal highness upon this accident sent him a handsome present and others of the nobility copied the laudable example of the second illustrious person in the three kingdoms i shall say no more of mr ryan but that he is genteel and wellmade  this gentleman has made several excursions in the region of poetry particularly a piece of one act called the cobblers opera which has often been performed with good success  no mark of age in face or form appears but manhood bordring on the vale of years mrs reynolds the husband of this person gathered a company of actors in the haymarket london where they some years ago met with success for a time but at last it fell topieces the sinews being relaxed by an intemperate constitution mrs reynolds was well esteemed for a very good performer in this kingdom but her reputation seems now to be forgot she is to be pitied if it is not her own fault  scandal may heal like gaping wounds in war yet leave behind the longdistinguishd scar thomas sheridan esquire this excellent actor was born in this kingdom son to that very eminent the reverend dr sheridan a gentleman whose memory will never be forgot while learning holds the reins to check the vicious mind and guide us in the paths of virtue men are but human brutes poring in the dark without some light of education under such a father and at such a fountain of learning as this nursery of erudition trinity college no wonder for our young actor to rise in perfection he was some time in westminster school and as his mind led him to look early toward the drama he had the advantage of seeing the regularity of the british theaters which he does not only copy but many who have seen both find the colors and drapery so strong that at this distance it stands in equal goodness to the original  to this gentleman we owe the decency that has been long wanting on the hibernian stage a difficulty no one person could have surmounted but himself and though merit does not always meet its proper reward yet the seeds of flowers and roots he had planted and sown in this theatrical garden flourish sweet and amiable and like a master in the art reward follows his pains and judgment in culture  the unmeritorious pass unobserved while merit is commonly the butt for envy to empty her whole quiver of poisoned arrows at yet they generally fall short of their intended mark i shall leave this gentleman to his prosperous and deserved success with the character of envy drawn by the inimitable pen of mr pope  envy will merit as its shade pursue but like the shadow proves the substance too for envied wit like sol eclipsed makes known the opposing bodys grossness not its own when first that sun toopowrful beams displays it draws up vapors which obscure its rays but even those clouds at last adorn its way reflect new glories and augment the day mr luke sparks mr sparks was born in this kingdom and has by incessant attention to the drama arrived to be a wellesteemed person in the business of the theater and there are many capital parts in the compass of his power so that he may be accounted a person in the highest second class i have seen him bear up the burden of a leading part to please the audience without thinking of a better to stand in his place he is equally useful in the buskin and sock and has the advantage of a good person and voice joined to diligent study he is esteemed an excellent oeconomist which may be accounted a very valuable disposition in the theatrical world there is something in the very science of the stage that urges on to pleasurable expense i knew a gentleman that called london the body of pleasure and the theater the heart  mr sparks is now in london at the fountain of theatrical erudition and i make no doubt from his good sense at his return to his native country he will meet with the proper esteem his merit deserves all or most people find satisfaction in novelty and a long possession of the best things is apt to depreciate them  it is novelty that brightens all our joys even beautys self by long possession cloys mr isaac sparks there are many parts that become the figure of this person which is of a superior height and nature has bestowed upon him a vein of humor that gives satisfaction to the audience i have not seen him act since his return to his native country but i am informed by very good judges that he performs the character of sir samson legend in love for love to the utmost perfection with many characters of that cast which will prove almost as useful in a theater as a hero or a lover  true merit with magnetic impulse draws a willing contribution of applause mr charles storer was born in england in the town of lancaster his strong inclination for the stage led him early to try his fortune there where he has succeeded very well his good understanding keeps him within the bounds of his own power which is the ready road never to meet with displeasure i think his talent leads him to old men in comedy and the artificial wrinkles in his face seem to content him best which is something singular with young persons in a theater for to appear pretty fellows is generally the aim of all young attempters in the theatrical province i have seen him give great satisfaction in gomez in the spanish friar foresight in love for love with other parts of the same cast and what in my opinion shows the strength of his judgment is that he was some years before he entered into any established theater therefore he has followed the best guide nature which is ever sure to be right  good sense and nature are not formed by art but spring from secret movements of the heart mrs storer formerly miss clark recommends herself by her amiable person goodnature and her excellent sweet harmonious manner in singing therefore she is too much desired to show her excellence that way to perform many speaking parts but where her exalted talent is required and then whatever she says or sings thus properly introduced she doubly charms in i shall end with four lines of a poem on ranelagh gardens written last summer in london  then storer  with her sweet enchanting strains steals to our hearts and over our senses reigns with ravished ears we hear the pleasing sounds and heavenly joys the vaulted roof resounds george swan esquire is a gentleman of a good family born in england he was made manager of the playhouse in aungierstreet which i think was a difficult attempt for a gentleman almost a stranger to the affairs of a theater it is a very thinking task and a person of pleasure must either drop his pursuits of that kind or sink in the boisterous waves which will require all his time and art to steer his vessel right as well may a country gentleman who never saw the sea by interest take the command of a first rate man of war however this person by a genteel behavior accompanied with affability joined with good nature gained the esteem of every one he played several parts with a delicate decency a person of distinction asked an actor his opinion of mr swans performance who replied he played very well as a gentleman the person replied i should be very glad to see you play like one with all my heart  i have heard mr swan has espoused a lady of considerable fortune in england i have been informed this gentleman had a considerable post at capebreton if it be true the duration of his office now peace is concluded may not last him longer than the government of the theater  which he may know how to use to the best advantage but the management of a theater was a task too hard for him  as well may readers turn reverse the book or reap the harvest with a pruninghook mr john thurmond was an actor of repute in this kingdom about thirty years past and stood in many capital parts being then a sharer in old smockalley theater with mr thomas elrington etc  to let you see how formerly even tragedy heroes were nowandthen put to their shifts i will tell you a short story that befell mr thurmond  it was a custom at that time for persons of the first rank and distinction to give their birthday suits to the most favored actors i think mr thurmond was honored by general ingoldsby with his but his finances being at the last tide of ebb the rich suit was put in buckle a cant word for forty in the hundred interest one night notice was given that the general would be present with the government at the play and all the performers on the stage were preparing to dress out in the suits presented the spouse of johnny as he was commonly called tried all her arts to persuade mr holdfast the pawnbroker as it fell out his real name to let go the clothes for that evening to be returned when the play was over but all arguments were fruitless nothing but the ready or a pledge of full equal value such people would have despised a demosthenes or a cicero with all their rhetorical flourishes if their oratorian gowns had been in pledge well what must be done the whole family in confusion and all at their witsend disgrace with her glaring eyes and extended mouth ready to devour fatal appearance at last winny the wife that is winnifrede put on a composed countenance but alas with a troubled heart stepped to a neighboring tavern and bespoke a very hot negus to comfort johnny in the great part he was to perform that night begging to have the silver tankard with the lid because as she said a covering and the vehicle silver would retain heat longer than any other metal the request was complied with the negus carried to the playhouse piping hot  poppd into a vile earthen mug  the tankard largent traveled incog under her apron like the persian ladies veiled poppd into the pawnbrokers hands in exchange for the suit  put on and played its part with the rest of the wardrobe when its duty was over carried back to remain in its old depository  the tankard returned the right road and when the tide flowed with its lunar influence the stranded suit was wasted into safe harbor again after paying a little for dry docking which was all the damage received  mr thurmond died in london when he was one of the company in drury lane theater a merry goodnatured companion to the last  thus womans wit though some account it evil with artful wiles can overreach the devil mrs thurmond her maiden name was lewis born of reputable parents at epsom in surry she was married to mr john thurmond the son of the abovementioned he is a person of a clean head and a clear heart and inherits the mirth and humor of his late father  mrs thurmond has an amiable person and good voice she wisely left the bustle and business of the stage in her full and ripe performance and at that time left behind her but few that excelled her mr thurmond contrived many profitable pantomimes for the theater royal in drury lane and was esteemed formerly a very good stage dancer but left the practice before it left him  the flowery bloom of may adorns the stage we shed our luster in declining age but yet how few observe the laboring ant to save a winterstore when most they want mr vanderbank was born in england in the year      his father came originally from holland mr vanderbank was brought up in the seaservice but not liking that inconstant element he embarked on a trading theater in england for some time till he made a voyage to this kingdom where he has remained these twoandthirty years he was as shakespeare says sunk in the vale of years when i arrived here in      and has not performed many parts since that time but i am informed both he and mrs vanderbank stood in high esteem formerly but they have both left the stage some time  declining age to sprightly youth gives place as these must do the next theatric race mr benjamin victor i might have in one respect omitted this gentleman as he only performed for his own diversion but as few persons that are not professed actors know better as i may say the dignity of the theater than himself i hope he will excuse this mentioning him to the public he was bred in london had a genteel education and from a just way of thinking and acting has improved his merits though he does not make poetry his profession yet i have seen several correct little poems of his as he has wrote many agreeable pieces that have never come to the press i shall beg leave as a taste to give one that has  a

gentleman has ushered two little pieces on the stage one a pastoral the other the mock pilgrim altered into one act from a comedy of beaumont and fletcher  mrs vincent formerly miss binks when i left england seven years ago was a very promising young actress and i am informed from those that have seen her on the stage here that she is greatly improved which i am apt to believe from the judgment of the manager who would certainly give the best parts to the best performers it is the interest of all theatrical managers to perform every thing in the best manner to do otherwise would be hurting themselves  that teacher might be justly called a fool who placed a dunce in his first class at school robert wilks esquire the ancestors of this most excellent comedian were seated many ages in an affluent inheritance at bromsgrove bromsgrove is one of the chief trading towns in the county for the finest broad cloths containing about  00 well built houses on the brink of the river salwarp    measured miles from london in worcestershire where most of the chief inhabitants bear the name of wilks  the grandfather of our excellent comedian judge wilks in the civil wars raised a troop of horse at his own expense for the service of the unfortunate king charles the first which was commanded by col wilks brother to the judge and great uncle to our comedian  in that unnatural war the family suffered greatly by rapine and persecution which was the main motive that sent edward wilks esquire with his wife and the shattered remains of an ample fortune to dublin for the security of his person etc  our great comedian was born at rathfarnham near dublin in the year    0 his father gave him a genteel education he wrote an excellent fine masterly hand with such celerity that was surprising his genius recommended him to secretary southwell who confirmed him one of his clerks when eighteen years of age  his first inclination to the theater proceeded from the praises of mr richards then an actor on the dublin stage mr richards lodged near mr wilks and being intimate with each other he used to hold the book of the play to hear if richards was perfect in the part he was then studying mr wilks used to read the introductive speeches with such proper emphasis cadence and all the various passions that the encomiums given by mr richards began to fire his mind for the drama it was with very little persuasion he ventured to act privately the colonel in the spanish friar at mr ashburys the ensuing christmas where he received such approbation from that great master as confirmed his intention  the first part he played on the theater was othello with the utmost applause and as he told me pleased all but himself he went on with great success for two years when his friend mr richards mr ashbury informed me that mr richards was a very good actor both in tragedy and comedy but not overhappy in his personal appearance advised him to try his fortune in england and gave him letters of recommendation to mr betterton who received him very kindly and entered him at fifteen shillings a week  his first appearance on the english stage was in the part of the young prince in the maids tragedy a very insignificant character requiring little more than an amiable figure mr betterton performed melantius but when that veteran actor came to address him on the battlements to excuse himself for the death of the king in the play mr wilks affirmed to me that the dignity of mr betterton struck him with such an awe that he had much ado to utter the little he had to say mr betterton observing his confusion said to him young man this fear does not ill become you a horse that sets out at the strength of his speed will soon be jaded  however mr wilks soon shook off his apprehensions and began to rise in the esteem of the audience and better parts gained him a better salary  he often assisted mr harris an eminent dancing master at that time in teaching his scholars and by his genteel address gained the affection of a young lady daughter to ferdinand knapton esquire steward of the new forest in hampshire and by consent of the father they were joined in wedlock by this gentlewoman he had one son and daughter the son died in his youth the daughter was married to captain price mrs price did not survive her marriage above a twelvemonth she expired childless in the year      the  0th year of her age  to whom he made up a fortune of a thousand pounds  mr wilkss finances not well answering the state of an increasing family he pressed for an addition to his salary which every person but the manager thought he deserved but his request was not complied with  mr ashbury in ireland hearing of his discontent came over on purpose to engage him he agreed with mr wilks for sixty pounds a year and a clear benefit which in those times was much more than any other actor ever had when he went to take his leave of mr betterton the manager was with him that great actor expressed some concern at his leaving the company i fansy said mr betterton that gentleman pointing to the manager if he has not too much obstinacy to own it will be the first that repents your parting for if i foresee aright you will be greatly wanted here  mr wilks told me this speech gave him infinite pleasure and made him resolve to search into himself to find out what mr bettertons known judgment seemed to promise he might find praise from an adept in any science will excite emulation and with some people do more than reward from this time mr wilks grew more assiduous and thought every moment lost that was not laid out upon his studies till he arrived at that supreme excellence even now remembered by innumerable judges of the drama  it was not long before the prophetic words of mr betterton were fulfilled for the unfortunate death of mountford mr william mountford was accounted an excellent comedian and mr wilks often confessed he was the glass that he ever adjusted himself by  mr mountford was basely murdered by a thrust through the back while a false friend held him in his arms with a treacherous embrace in norfolkstreet in the strand in the year      he was the author of the following plays    injured love or the ambitious father a tragedy         the successful strangers a comedy    0    greenwich park a comedy         the life and death of dr faustus      with the humors of harlequin and scaramouch an entertainment of three acts   was the sickness of all their genteel comedies till his parts could be supplied mr wilks therefore was immediately sent to with proposals of four pounds a week which was a salary equal to mr betterton this was too advantageous an offer to be refused therefore he prepared for his journey privately mr ashbury was so unwilling to part with him that he procured an order from the duke of ormond then lord lieutenant to prevent his going but a particular friend giving him timely notice thereof he went secretly to hoath where a boat waited to convey him on board and he landed safe in england  the first part he performed of mountfords was palamede mr cibber has from this play of marriage alamode and the comedy part of secret love or the maiden queen compounded with some ingredients of his own an excellent comedy called the comical lovers in drydens marriage alamode a comedy with such extraordinary success as he often said it made him almost mad with joy i need say no more of his progress in success than that he sailed in the full tide of fortune till he arrived safely to reign unrivalled to his death  and as a reward for his great merit he was joined in the patent granted by queen anne in the year   0  he was also manager of the whole and i shall not take from the merit of others when i say from his sole directions the stage gained new life and reward followed the industry for a continued course of the three managers for more than twenty years the stage was in full perfection their greenrooms greenrooms are the chambers where the principal performers retire till they are called to their entrances where they are to go on the stage were free from indecencies of every kind and might justly be compared to the most elegant drawingrooms of the prime quality no fops or coxcombs ever showed their monkey tricks there but if they chanced to thrust in were awed into respect even persons of the first rank and taste of both sexes would often mix with the performers without any stain to their honor or understanding and indeed mr wilks was so genteelly elegant in his fancy of dress for the stage that he was often followed in his fashion though in the street his plainness of habit was remarkable  in march        mrs wilks mrs wilks was interred in the church of covent garden with the following inscription on her tomb wrote by her husband  beneath this marble lies elizabeth wilks late wife to robert wilks of this parish gent the purity of her mind which appeared in all the duties of a virtuous life made her a good wife daughter mother and friend her affection was like her piety constant as unfeigned to her last moment in memory of her virtues this monument was erected by her husband she died the   st of march        in the   d year of her age  left this world to the inconsolable sorrow of her worthy husband he continued unmarried upwards of seven years in the mean time he renewed his acquaintance with mrs fell relict of charles fell esquire of an ancient family in lancashire and married her this gentlewomans maiden name was brown of a reputable family in sussex i shall relate an unfortunate accident concerning john brown esquire the father of mr wilkss second wife which he informed me of this gentleman lived near spelmonden in kent on a handsome estate he took great delight in shooting one day he went out with his servant to his usual diversion they sprung some game that flew over a neighboring hedge he ordered his servant to follow and observe them on the other side while he would take care on the side where he was the hedge was of great extent and mr brown went slowly by the side in expectation of the game at last they came and he fired the servant on the other side of the hedge did the same and unfortunately shot his master in the face only with two grains of shot but alas one in each eye that for ever deprived him of sight yet mr wilks informed me he was as cheerful a gentleman as ever he conversed with and would lead him to every particular fruittree in his large garden and nominate the fruit they bore and that very servant the innocent guilty as he called him lived with him at the time i received this account from mr wilks   mr wilkss excellence in comedy was never once disputed but the best judges extol him for the different parts in tragedy as hamlet castalio in the orphan ziphares in mithridates edgar in king lear norfolk in the albion queens piercy in anna bullen earl of essex shore macduff moneses in tamerlane jaffeir in venice preserved and a countless catalogue of other parts in tragedy which he was allowed to perform in their full perfection  he was not only perfect in every part he acted but in those that were concerned with him in every scene which often prevented mistakes  but let me have recourse to other pens for his excellencies one writes thus  no sooner had mr wilks left the hibernian stage and appeared on the british but that sinking theater raised its drooping head and what was reckoned almost a scandal to belong to has ever since been by that great mans management and justice raised to the greatest theater in the universe female tatler  the person and behavior of mr wilks in the part of essex has no small share in conducing to the popularity of the play tatler no    vol    this performance the trip to the jubilee is the greatest instance that we can have of the irresistible force of proper action mr wilks enters into the part with so much skill that the gallantry the youth and gaiety of a young man of a plentiful fortune is looked upon with as much indulgence on the stage as in real life tatler no     in the preface to the same play the author says whenever the stage has the misfortune to lose mr wilks that wildair may go to the jubilee  in the preface to the stratagem the author ends thus the reader may find some faults in this play which my illness prevented the amending of but there is great amends made in the representation which cannot be matched no more than the friendly and indefatigable care of mr wilks to whom i chiefly owe the success of the play  here is enough said to illustrate the personal qualifications of this gentleman as an actor therefore let me attempt to delineate his mind  his purse was ever open to proper objects of charity and i have often seen tears in his eyes at the relation of any misfortune that befell others he was ever the first proposer in any joint charity from the theatrical stock and i am convinced has often prevailed upon their unwilling liberality his care of the orphan daughters of mr farquhar by giving them several benefit plays continued to the last of his days and in losing him they have in reality lost a father but i hope his constant stream of bounty has placed them above want in short his private acts of charity are numberless i shall add one in particular  a gentleman a native of ireland whose name is smith who received a liberal education in trinitycollege dublin brought a tragedy to the managers of the theater royal in drury lane for their approbation the play was read and returned with desire to make some alterations for the next season this postponing but ill agreed with our authors circumstances that loudly called for a speedy supply mr wilks knowing the ill state of his finances bought a night of his brother there managers and gave it to mr smith for a benefit yet he did not think that susficient but used all his interest to make it truly a benefit and put a hundred guineas clear in the authors pocket with which he took leave of his benefactor and the muses embarked for holland where he put himself under the tuition of the great boerhaave at leyden and in time profited so well that his great master of medicine sent him to petersburgh at the request of the czarina where at his first arrival a handsome pension was settled upon him i have seen several letters from this gentleman to mr wilks a copy of one i procured from his widow which i shall give as a note for the singularity of it petersburgh jan   o s my dear friend i received yours with inexpressible pleasure by captain pawlet with the books how shall i thank you but no matter you desire i would give you an account of myself i am at this instant alone in my chamber wrapped up to my nose in furs before a woodfire that might serve you in the street for a night of rejoicing for stoves i do not use on my right of the table my ink and paper on the left a bottle of good nantz though i am no sot and yet the moon and stars shine bright without a cloud large enough to cover a tragedy plume when day appears i must see it with a candle for my windows will be covered with a cold coat of frost more of a thick substance than the glass and yet it is not three to one but tomorrows suns short progress will uncloath em and leave em slark naked again if i were to appear before you fashionably dressed you would take me for a russian bear i am so clumsily befurrd not only from top to toe as hamlet says but head and feet  i have practice more than i desire this cold cold weather and well paid a physician to the crown here never wants practice i was sent for yesterday to a man that had been dead some hours a noblemans servant frozen to death behind his masters sled but i left him to be buried first receiving my fee and a pint glass of brandy for i am not holy enough to work miracles  i have a good stomach and eat and drink well here is no want of any thing but warmth in our long winter and coolness in our short summer being many degrees different from you in both however we have our winter fires and summer shady groves and bowers i have served my time to the language of the country and it is now become my servant my royal mistress is a good plump roundfacd lady and does me the honor to ask me some questions now we understand each other were you here you would have but a small share in amors love goes by weight in russia and those that thrive in flesh succeed best a native painter would draw venus like an overgrown hostess and harper would make an excellent mars in picture lolling at the feet of the fat cyprian goddess were the wellgrown bear here he would be bojar or lord at his first landing my greatest task is to keep sober amongst a nation of drunkards captain pawlet will bring you a few furs with a small quantity of ermin the product of russia were i settled in geeenland i should do the same and land you a whale or a white bear you will receive them without any other weight but themselves but who gave me these furs this affluence this royal mistress this happy situation a man just of your age and stature if you cannot find him out ask my dear and worthy friend sir harry wildair and tell him at the same time the grain was his and the reaper with the crop shall ever be at his command etc      this great and good man continued to charm till the last of his performing on the stage he left this world the   th of september      and i must declare i have not yet seen his equal in comedy his disconsolate widow caused the following inscription to be put on his monument in st pauls coventgarden this superexcellent comedian by his own request was interred at    oclock at night to avoid ostentation yet to pay his memory the greatest honor that was ever done to a subject the gentlemen of the choir belonging to the kings chapel came voluntarily and performed ar anthem prepared for the solemn occasion  with the arms of the wilkss family which are three roses and a rose for the crest his second wife lies also in the same vault lately deceased  near this place in hopes of a happy resurrection lies the body of robert wilks esquire one of the patentees of his majestys theater a man in private life for many amiable qualities justly esteemed in public universally applauded in the same vault united again in death lies his beloved and loving wife mary daughter of john brown esquire of spelmonden in the county of kent relict of charles fell esquire of swarthmorehall in lancashire an affectionate wife and indulgent mother a kind mistress and a faithful friend her charitable disposition to the poor was at all times extended to the utmost of her power and flowed from a heart sensibly affected with compassion and benevolence there is no issue left of this excellent man to perpetuate his memory but his good deeds will last for ever i shall finish with two lines of a poem wrote upon his death  farewell o born with every art to please politeness grace gentility and ease mr henry woodward was born in the year      in london where he received a genteel education he is a very thriving comedian and a very peaceable mimic for he never strikes first but if he receives the first blow he generally returns it with double the strength of his adversary he is an excellent harlequin and has what most of the motleycoat gentry want an excellent head to his heels and if his black mask should be thrown aside for a whole age though levity will hardly lie so long obscured yet as a just and pleasing actor in comedy he can never want encouragement anywhere if theaters are in use joined to his good understanding and pleasantry his goodnature is ever conspicuous upon all proper occasions cool in his resentments and warm in his friendships a man fit for the world and the world for him and knows how to look on fortune  fortune a goddess is to fools alone the wise are always masters of their own mr robert wetherilt this person was born at stamford in lincolnshire in the year   0  where his father and mother belonging to a country company were then playing he played as he informed me the part of the duke of york in richard the third before he could speak plain so that it may be said he was born an actor he came with his mother who was a wellesteemed actress at that time to drurylane a boy where he showed his rising genius first in the part of squire richard in the provoked husband from thence he went to the theater in goodmansfields where he married the sister of mr denis delane then of that theater  in the year      he came over into this kingdom and may be well remembered his excellence in several parts of comedy having not yet been outdone i cannot avoid mentioning a passage in the life of this truly good comedian  while he and his family belonged to the theater royal in drury lane after the company had finished the season of playing in london which generally is at the end of may he with his father and mother went for the summerseason to play at several towns in lincolnshire the custom of many of both established theaters when the company were summoned to meet in london at the usual time the latter end of august to begin the winterseason i received the following short letter  grantham august   sir mr wetherilt and his wife beg you will excuse them to mr wilks their son is at the point of death they beg an answer be pleased to direct to your humble servant  r stukely apothecary in grantham lincolnshire  the meaning why i mention this letter is that the son the very night this letter was wrote in all appearance expired was stripped and washed the bed taken away and he laid stretched on a mat with a basin of salt a common custom in england placed on his stomach the inconsolable parents removed to another house the coffin brought to the sons chamber and the windows all open about eight at night a person was sent with a light to watch the corpse when she opened the door the first object she perceived was poor bob as he was generally called by his familiars sitting up with his teeth trembling in his head and well they might with cold the woman in her fright dropped the candle and screamd out the devil the devil this fright alarmed another woman below who ran upstairs to see what was the matter in the mean time bob with much ado had made a shift to get from the bed and taking up the candle which lay upon the floor unextinguishd was creeping to the door to call for assistance as naked as from the womb of his mother which the two women perceiving with joint voices repeated again a ghost a ghost the devil the devil the master of the house hearing this uproar ran himself to know the reason where poor bob the supposed devil and he soon came to a right understanding he was put into a warm bed to the unspeakable joy of his desponding parents and in ten days after in london viva voce told me the whole story of his death  this accident when real death paid him a visit worked so strongly upon his forlorn parents that they would not let his corpse be coffined till five days after he expired vain hope he died in      in the   th year of his age both his parents died soon after him i am sorry to end this account with saying his company was so desirable that he had many trials of skill with his constitution he was buried in a very genteel manner in the round churchyard  in trials of drinking pray let me assure ye i never intend to be one of the jury mr thomas walker this person was born in the year   00 in his youth he was a very promising actor the part of charles in the nonjuror a comedy founded upon molieres tartuff by mr cibber which was performed at the theater royal in drury lane in the year      gave him the first establishment as an actor the applause he gained from performing the part of macheath in the beggars opera was fatal to him he followed bacchus too ardently insomuch that his credit was often drowned upon the stage and by degrees almost rendered him useless  he was the supposed author of two dramatic pieces viz the quakers opera and a tragedy called the fate of villainy this play he brought to ireland in the year      and prevailed on the proprietors to act it under the title of love and loyalty the second night was given out for his benefit but not being able to pay in half the charge of the common expenses the doors were ordered to be kept shut but i remember few people came to ask the reason however i fear this disappointment hastened his death for he survived it but three days dying in the   th year of his age a martyr to what often stole from him a good understanding  he who delights in drinking out of season takes wondrous pains to drown his manly reason mr thomas wright this gentleman was born in the year   0  he is descended of a good family and had a liberal education it is with some concern i say he had once a good fortune  his first appearance as an actor in london was with mr giffard at the theater in goodmansfields from whence he removed with that gentleman to lincolnsinnfields theater and from thence he was invited to the theater royal in drury lane but receiving some ill usage from mr fleetwood then patentee he came over to this kingdom in the year      where he appeared to great advantage in several capital characters he afterward went out with a country company to several parts of this kingdom and is now as i am informed head of a company of players in england in my opinion his deservings might make him desirable in any regular theater he having a proper person pleasing voice and being always perfect in what he performs joined to a good understanding to feel what he speaks  but various causes various minds employ some love to save while others would destroy mr james worsdale this facetious person must not be forgot whose performance as an actor and a poet has often diverted the town he was taught the use of the pencil under that celebrated painter sir godfrey kneller i do not pretend to rescue him from the lash of a lady who has thought fit to correct him but this i know that i have been in his company when his quick imagination has struck out several pieces of humor that have given great pleasure in his manner of singing to give one instance of it he and i were together without any other company when on the back of a playbill he struck out the following song for his little opera called a cure for a scold  whoever to a wife is linked for his life is placed in a wretched condition though plagued with her tricks like a blister she sticks and death is his only physician poor man and death etc so the cur who possessed a bone of the best could lick it or leave it at pleasure but if to his tail it is tied without fail he is harassed and plagued without measure poor cur he is harassed etc now what convinces me of the quick coinage of this song is that the last stanza was produced by the accident of seeing a dog run at that instant by the window with a bone tied to his tail followed by a hooting mob  this may certainly be said of him that he had an inexhaustible fund of good humor goodnature and generosity and might have had a heavier purse if he had not been so light of heart i shall end with two lines of his own with very little variation  may be ever from duns and from bailiffs be freed and shake a loose leg on each side of the tweed mr john watson is a person worthy of imitation from his economy and behavior in private life he belonged to the stage from his youth first as a prompter but many years as an actor if he does not excel he is ever decent his long continuance in the business has made him perfect almost in every character and such a person must be extremely useful in a theater  he best can guide a stranger in the road who often the mazy labyrinth has trod mr james williams must not be forgot since what he does he does well and in my judgment were he put forward in some parts in low comedy his execution would not lose him any reputation in one ingredient to make up a play i think him the best i have ever known that is a propertyman propertyman is the person that receives a bill from the prompter for what is necessary in every new or revived play as purses wine suppers poison daggers halters axes and many more implements of execution with a thousand other etc etc etc   his bloodless weapons only kill in jest and those that drink his poisons fare the best mrs woffington this amiable actress was born in dublin of reputable parents who gave her a genteel education her sprightly genius led her early to the stage where she made a rapid progress her first establishment was in the character of sir harry wildair in this kingdom which was the first part she performed in covent garden theater and had a successive progress of upwards of twenty nights with universal applause the manager of that theater having some dispute with her relating to salary as i am informed she engaged with the manager of drury lane where she has reigned in full perfection unrivaled in the parts she undertakes till her late reestablishment at covent garden  as merit too often creates envy the little world the theater is not free from it this agreeable actress in the part of sir harry coming into the greenroom said pleasantly in my conscience i believe half the men in the house take me for one of their own sex another actress replied it may be so but in my conscience the other half can convince them to the contrary as the theater is the test of other peoples wit why may they not find a little among themselves  i am informed she now shines in several capital parts in tragedy viz cleopatra in all for love jane shore monimia calista in the fair penitent etc i shall mention as my last note an accident that fell out at this play the first season it was performed in the year      which i gathered from that stage chronicle mr john bowman  lothario after he is killed by altamont in the  th act lies dead by proxy in the  th raised on a bier covered with black by the propertyman and the face whitened by the barber the coat and perriwig generally filled by one of the dressers most of the capital actors in the established theaters have generally a dresser to themselves though they are paid by the manager to be ready on all occasions for stageguards attendance etc  mr powell played lothario and one warren his dresser claimed a right of lying for his master and performing the dead part of lothario which he proposed to act to the best advantage though powell was ignorant of the matter the fifth act began and went on as usual with applause but about the middle of the distressful scene powell called aloud for his man warren who as loudly replied from the bier on the stage here sir powell who as i said before was ignorant of the part his man was doing repeated without loss of time come here this moment you son of a whore or i will break all the bones in your skin warren knew his hasty temper therefore without any reply jumped off with all his sables about him which unfortunately were tied fast to the handles of the bier and dragged after him but this was not all the laugh and roar began in the audience till it frightened poor warren so much that with the bier at his tail he threw down calista mrs barry and overwhelmed her with the table lamp book bones together with all the lumber of the charnelhouse he tugged till he broke off his trammels and made his escape and the play at once ended with immoderate fits of laughter even the grave mr betterton smiled in the tumult and enjoyed the storm but he would not let the fair penitent be played any more that season till poor warrens misconduct was something forgot     i shall leave this lady to proceed in her path of merit where she still leads with an epilogue wrote purely for her manner of speaking and as prologues and epilogues are the most difficult tasks of both sexes on the stage it is to be remarked but few besides the capital performers are trusted with them and a good prologue and epilogue have often helped a bad play out of the mire or at least sent the audience home a little better humored  epilogue volunteer enters reading the gazette curse on all cowards say i  why  bless my eyes  no  no  it cannot be true  this gazette lies  our men retreat before a scrub banditi who scarce could fright the buffcoats of the city well  if it is so and that our men will not stand it is time we women take the thing in hand  thus in my countrys cause i now appear a bold smart khevenhuller volunteer  and really mark some heroes in the nation you will think this no unnatral transformation for if in valor real manhood lies all cowards are but  women in disguise  they cry these rebels are so stout and tall ah lard i would lower the proudest of em all try but my courage place me in the van and post me if i dont bring down my man  had we an army of such charging wenches what man do you think would dare to attack our trenches o how the cannon of our eyes would maul em but our masked battries  lud how they would gall em no rebel against such force durst take the field  for damme we would die before wed yield joking aparr we women have strong reason to stop the progress of this popish treason for now when female libertys at stake all women ought to bustle for its sake should these audacious sons of rome prevail vows convents and that heathen thing a veil must come in fashion and such institutions would suit but oddly with our constitutions what gay coquet would like a nuns profession and i have some private reasons against confession besides our good men of the church they say who now thank heaven may love as well as pray must then be only wed to cloistered houses  hold there we are fobbd of
