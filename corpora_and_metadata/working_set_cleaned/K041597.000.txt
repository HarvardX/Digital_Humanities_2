epistle to flavia on the sight of two pindarick odes on the spleen and vanity written by a lady her friend flavia to you with safety i commend this verse the secret failing of your friend to your goodnature i securely trust who know that to conceal is to be just the muse like wretched maids by love undone from friends acquaintance and the light would run conscious of folly fears attending shame fears the censorious world and loss of fame some confident by chance she finds though few pity the fools whom love or verse undo whose fond compassion sooths her in the sin and sets her on to venture once again sure in the better ages of old time nor poetry nor love was thought a crime from heaven they both the gods best gifts were sent divinely perfect both and innocent then were bad poets and loose loves not known none felt a warmth which they might blush to own beneath cool shades our happy fathers lay and spent in pure untainted joys the day artless their loves artless their numbers were while nature simply did in both appear nor could the censor or the critic fear pleased to be pleased they took what heaven bestowed nor were too curious of the given good at length like indians fond of fancied toys we lost being happy to be thought more wise in one cursed ge to punish verse and sin critics and hangmen both at once came in wit and the laws had both the same ill fate and partial tyrants swayed in either state then a lewd tide of verse with vicious rage broke in upon the morals of the age the stage whose art was once the mind to move to noble daring and to virtuous

all parnassus her blessed laws obey say from what sacred fountain nymph divine the treasures flow which in thy verse do shine with what strange inspiration art thou blessed what more than delphic ardor warms thy breast our sordid earth never bred so bright a flame but from the skies thy kindred skies it came to numbers great like thine thangelick quire in joyous consort tune the golden lyre viewing with pitying eyes our cares with thee they wisely own that all is vanity even all the joys which mortal minds can know and find ardelias verse the least vain thing below if pindars name to those blessed mansions reach and mortal muses may immortal teach in verse like his the heavenly nation raise their tuneful voices to their makers praise nor shall celestial harmony disdain for once to imitate an earthly strain whose fame secure no rival ere can fear but those above and fair ardelia here she who undaunted could his raptures view and with bold wings his sacred heights pursue safe through the dithyrambick stream she steered nor the rough deep in all its dangers feared not so the rest who with successless pain the unnavigable torrent tried in vain so clelia leapt into the rapid flood while the etruscans struck with wonder stood amidst the waves her rash persuers died the matchless dame could only stem the tide and gain the glory of the farther side see with what pomp the antic masque comes in the various forms of the fantastic spleen vain empty laughter howling grief and tears false joy bred by false hope and falser fears each vice each passion which pale nature wears in this odd monstrous medley mixed appears like bays his dance confusedly round they run statesman coquet gay fop and pensive nun specter and heroes husbands and their wives with moukishdrones that
