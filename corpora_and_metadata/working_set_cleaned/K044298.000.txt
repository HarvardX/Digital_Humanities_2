a scotsmans remarks on the farce of love a la mode scene by scene as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  nemo me impune lacessit london printed for j burd near the temple gate fleet street m dcc lx price one shilling  a scotsmans remarks etc without any ostentatious display of the origin of comedy or farce as is but too usual among prosessed pamphleteers i shall confine this criticism solely to the piece in question love a la mode  the business of it in the sense of horace is a subject publici juris a common and obvious one to all writers and will remain so to the end of time to wit a young ladys being courted by a number of contrasted lovers whose characters from their discordance with each other are to furnish out the comic entertainment  of this kind we have several on the english besides those on other theaters of europe viz miss lucy in town miss in her teens andc  and yet an author may derive merit from this subject of common right as we may call it in proportion as he shall introduce personages of an higher rank of life more elegant coloring and a quite novel complexion  whenever this shall be executed it is to be looked upon as the work of true genius but when fallen short of as often happens it is to be deemed the impotent effort of the hardbound brains of low plagiaries whose memory is filled with the shreds and illchosen scraps of other mens wit  in which of these two classes the author of love a la mode is to be ranked will appear from the subsequent remarks whom however the most inveterate enemies he has cannot refuse being guilty of modesty and gratitude on this occasion  of modesty in not publishing and of gratitude in not giving his generous benefactors occasion of repenting their having patronized such coarse inaccurate scenes and so affrontful to themselves  to proceed methodically let us first examine into the propriety of the characters of his drama and secondly how he has conducted the whole and how brought on and carried off his people  the dramatis personae are sir theodore goodchild a wealthy merchant of london mordecai a wealthy jew fop sir archibald msarcasm a scotch knight sir callaghan o brallaghan an irish officer in the prussian service groom an english esquire fond of racehorses etc charlotte a young lady of a considerable fortune and the ward of sir theodore   propriety of characters for the present purpose may be divided into two sorts  the one to make them act and speak in every thing suitably to their intended purpose untainted by any peculiarly vicious manner of country or education  the other is when the character is made to result entirely from a provincial dialect and local manners  the chief mongrel characters of this farce are a monstrous compound of both there is nothing merely national in either the scotch or irish man but an apeing of the vulgar accent of bothnations with a few strained not natural blunders in the hibernian heros mouth since such the author has been pleased to constitute him  the character of m sarcasm is somewhat of rancunes cast in the comic romance written by the facetious scarron  he is a rascal in every sense who delights in flattering all present man or woman to his or her face shrugging contempt at them at the same time when they turn their backs and tearing them to pieces when absent  this character is the produce of every climate and the irish in general if we take their own words for it i mean no national reflection for that i scorn implead themselves for a too general tendency to detraction and to the first comer whereas the scots are very cautious to whom they disclose their disadvantageous opinions of any person  sir callaghan o brallaghan is made a prussian officer to introduce him under that passport more favorably to the crowd if the author had chosen it he might with much justice and perhaps more have introduced a scotsman in that service there being no corpse of either nation in it as in france and that moreover there was in favor of the north briton his brave countryman general keith who had long shared the favor assisted in the councils and ultimately fallen in the service of prussias everglorious monarch  it sure then ill becomes any assumed character of officership in that heroic service to squint the least however indirectly against scotch valor which is impudently done more than once in this farce  an irish officer in the french spanish or austrian service would have been more agreeable to the general received notions of mankind but such an incoherent medley of heroism and stupidity as o brallaghan is dished out here by his countryman ver has been exhibited before nor ought to be borne by any audience that would lay a claim to rationality  mordecai the beau jew is nobody a mere expletive football persona to be made a cats paw of to be abused insulted and have jokes cracked upon him  squire groom is no national characteristic of england but a general representative of any person of the three kingdoms who likes horseracing drinking etc preferably to any other happiness but why he should be the type of the english nation i cannot see and therefore leave it to the very jumbling author to explain in the best manner he can for objects receive strange aspects as they pass through the camera obscura of his intellect  sir theodore goodchild as well as his ward charlotte are two very silly schemers considering how the world is at present situated and that all marriages are rather the objects of prudence than passion we are not arcadian shepherds either in this or the next island  as i am but lately come from scotland the first view i had of love a la mode was on saturday sennight when a young gentleman who sat near me in the pit was pleased to inform me that it had been much shortened and altered for the better since the first performance of it that moreover it used at first to be preceded by a plaintive prologue spoken as was supposed by a waternymph or one like niobe all tears to deprecate the publics resentment from the vile stuff that was to be presented nay he added it was not unlike a childs endeavoring with sobs and tears to conciliate the favor of an incensed public in the behalf of a sinful but repenting parent  the piece opens by sir theodore and charlottes having agreed to lay a scheme to try which of her lovers was the most sincere by their declaring after dinner that he was a bankrupt etc and she ruined of consequence  a pretty amusement for a wealthy merchant and an experiment that few young ladies of fortune ought to try nowadays however great their merit nay even granting that of their suitor and his having strong affections for them  there are family reasons such as the providing for the younger children etc which would prove often insurmountable obstacles where poverty should really be presented in the place of an expected large fortune  she gives to her guardian as if he had neither known nor seen them before a respective description of her woers  if it was meant to inform the audience it is stupid enough that is like prefixing an explanatory argument to a play their appearance and business is to let the audience into the secret of what they are which accounts should ever be shortly done and to those supposed not to have had any prior knowledge  that given of the jew beau mordecai as well as the treatment of him throughout is idly and grossly insulting a body of people since the jewact has not taken place and who ought to meet with better treatment from a man who owed his geting any footing on the stage to the supposition of his having well represented one of their community  that given of msarcasm is partly already hinted at with his being vainglorious of the antiquity of his family  that of squire groom gives but a very faint idea of what the actors excellence displays  the picture drawn of the irish hero is rather that of a bully than a brave officer nor is either wrote up nor consequently acted up to he is described with a highcocked hat long sword shortskirted coat and affecting a tremendous stride to which the lady adds you would think that mars had been his fosterfather and bellona his nurse etc there needed only to have been added that every morning he drank gunpowder tea for his breakfast and that he swallowed pistol balls like sugarplumbs by way of helping digestion  yet when sir callaghan comes into action both his language and demeanor are of the gentlest cast  sir theodore pretends business out in order to give room for charlottes receiving all her lovers before dinner to which they had been invited and are expected except squire groom who was it seems engaged in a great horsematch at new market  sir theodore on his going out is met by the first arrived visitor mordecai who enters rather like a masquerade buffoon than any thing else and disgracing italian airs like a lunatic castrato  after a few commonplace compliments he upon her beauty she upon his taste elegance etc she accuses him with addressing a certain lady etc he expresses great uneasiness to know from whom she had learned it she tells him from msarcasm  here mordecai adds to the already disadvantageous character given of the north britons poisonous tongue by calling him the scandal spreader and pasquin of the town and says he is so great a scoundrel no gentleman of his country will keep him company  this is but a poor salvo  why then impose all the scoundrelism of the piece upon scots shoulders it certainly was by no means intended as a compliment but rather as a gross affront to north britain as well as the weak designer could execute it  msarcasm comes into miss charlottes apartment and though on an intended visit to her sees mordecai before the lady though why we are not told in order it seems to have a little fun with him  there is great art here  he then turns to the lady asks her pardon for not having seen her before though she was as obvious an object as then in a very tiresome drawling hesitating repeating and on the whole execrable imitation of the scots accent through which breaks out ever and anon the irish brogue  among other things in his very uncouth address he declares her to be an epitome of all mentel and bodely perfections and that she is a devenety sir callaghan o brallaghans name being brought on the carpet msarcasm bids them not to be uneasy about him that he has brought him along with him for c   that like the kings of old he never travels without his ful and that he has left him writing a love epistle below stairs which he is sure has not been equalled since the days of don quexote  e  h  he does not tell us in what apartment below stairs he had left him this gives a very contemptible idea of the authors hero that by msarcasm a known rivals advice he should misemploy so much time below stairs in penning either a sonet or an epistle while the other during that interval was making the most of his suit  mordecai desirous to have a slice as they call it of the irishman by way of a whet before dinner goes off and commodiously to give msarcasm an opportunity of abusing all his rivals which he does elaborately  squire groom he represents to her as a man of ruined fortune a newmarket sharper a contemptible jokey who would always prefer his horses etc to her  mordecai his favorite butt for abuse he vilisies among other things for his complexion etc  the irishman he bids her beware of on account of his being her guardians nephew whom he insinuates to her he has certain information of having a design upon her fortune  he lastly comes to himself and then blazons forth to her the advantages that she will have though sprung from sugarhogsheads rumpuncheons a comptinghouse etc to be married into an ancient femily of which there are four vicounts six earls three marquesses and two duks besides lairds and baronets out of aw rechoning beyond number  what humming and hawing in this dull prolix declaration  where is the propriety of charlottes guardian being uncle to sir callaghan it gives room to suspect a collusion  beau mordecai the little girgeshite returns brimful of joy to tell them the irishman is coming sir callaghan whom from the description given of his person and carriage one was to expect to see enter the room in a most formidable swaggering manner and dealing terror around on the contrary comes on with all the mild vacancy of looks that denote a goodnatured untravelled young man  he addresses the lady rather with respectful bashfulness and timidity than conformable to the boisterous picture charlotte had drawn of him and up to which his dialogue is not written so the actor is not at all in fault but the author is for his inconsistences  he is asked to indulge the lady with the description of a battle which he declines at first for the reason that he thinks it unbecoming to make mention of such matters before a lady and that it favors too much of the fansaron  but urged farther he declares to her that there is so much doing every where there is no knowing what is done any where  that every man has so much business of his own he has no time to mind that of his neighbors  that there is such drumming and shouting and smoke and fighting and the delicious noise of arms that it is no more possible to give an account of a battle than of the stars in the firmament  msarcasm like another iago in order to bring mordecai into a scrape eggs him on to put to sir callaghan such questions as might the readier provoke his anger  mordecai asks in a pert manner pray sir callaghan how many men may you have killed in your time  to which sir callaghan replies more than a coward would choose to eat or an impertinent fellow would dare to look on  so are you answered mr beau mordecai  msarcasm hugs himself with joy at the agreeable notion of mordecais running himself into a scrape which might probably rid him of both rivals  he encourages him to go on  to mordecais ridiculous taunting and saying if he were a general sir callaghan rejoins turning to the lady look at the general madam  it is a trade not so easy to be learned it requires great genius as well as being up late and early enduring the summers scorching heat and winters freezing cold dangers should be his chief delight glory ever in view death his greatest reward by which he will live for ever  during this speech the scot and the jew are chuckling to each other the latter bursting into a sit of laughter cries o the bull a man live by death  sir callagh yes mr mordecai a man live by his death is not julius caesar alexander and all the other heroes though dead two thousand years ago alive in history and will be so to the end of time  and is not your brave young general who died for his countrys glory before quebec as much alive as any of them and will be so to the end of time  this is a mobtimed nay begging claptrap and therefore the lady with a swelling breast figures in to this purpose all the brave men who perished on that occasion must be thought on with applause while british annals or british gratitude remains  the durseys the lockmans the macleanes and all of that species are sure of claps by such springes to catch woodcocks but true genius disdains because the claims it has on same derive from more noble motives  opportunely a message comes about dinner which draws away the lady and the jew  msarcasm having represented the latter as a most contemptible being a rascal etc to the irishman asks him if he has written the letter according as he had advised to the young lady  sir callaghan replies in the negative but says he has written a letter to the uncle which in his sense will do as well at this answer msarcasm sniggers to himself and prays to hear the contents as matter of entertaining curiosity  among other articles o brallaghan reads in the letter nothing is so unbecoming a man of honor as to behave like a scoundrel upon the novelty of which sentiment msarcasm sneeringly compliments him which the dubbed hero receives kindly  in the subsequent part of his letter is this paragraph bidding him to consider the antiquity of the o brallaghans family as old nay older than any family in the three kingdoms or even in europe it being related to all the o sullivans o shaghesesnys o flahertys mdermots mcloghlans etc  a thorough milesian list  msarcasm objects to the assertion of his family being so ancient and that when he said so he must have lost fight of the north britons who are the only pure nobility in great britain  o brallaghan answers he knew very well what he had said upon which msarcasm insinuates in an angry manner that his having said so must be attributed to his ignorance and vanity  o brallaghan kindles and says he does not understand what m sarcasm would be at who says that o brallaghans assertion must be ascribed to his being ignorant and vain o brallaghan in a mild manner declares that m sarcasm must eat his words or give him 0 brallaghan satisfaction  msarcasm with a violent affectation of irascibility draws for immediate action against which on account of the impropriety of the place o brallaghan expostulates  but upon m sarcasms insisting from a supposed surmise of his antagonists being shy o brallaghan draws and tells him that since determined he is as welcome as the flowers in june  the covert sneer against the brave highlanders before quebec is too flagrant  the whole of the irish being called outcasts of the scots and the scots being retorted as irishmens bastards etc is too vile for criticism  upon this scussle with the usual decorum of the rest of the characters entering comes on alone unattended by servants etc the lady and asking what is the cause of quarrel sir callaghan answers it was about msarcasms grandmother etc  the lady having made peace on which occasion the scotchman is made the readier to strike and after bids the irishman aside not to expose himself in speaking about the belles lettres classics etc  of which teague had not mentioned the least word upon account of the damnable twist upon his tongue  sir callaghan replies this is one of the scenes like humor that it is not he but msarcasm that has so damned a northern brogue that nobody can understand him  for a decision they both apply to the lady who answers in so politely cautious a manner as to make them both happy and goes off praying that they will not tarry coming to dinner  but the two lovers appetites not being so keen as the ladys they remain and on msarcasms advising sir callaghan to be vigorous and push his point the other sings a song declaratory of his sentiments o you never did hear of an irishmans fear in love or in battle etc the sense of the rest is that they make all the men in fighting and all the women in intriguing strike to them which is tantamount to an old song amongst the lowest class of prosligates that are banished to england from that country for fighting and f to write in the tristram shandy way there is nobody like us  for english fathers with their daughters english husbands with their wives english brothers with their sisters etc to attend to encourage and applaud such gross ribaldry declares them truly meritorious of the cornuted honors said to be so often conserred upon them by their western brethren  when they take a moments leisure to think they must be covered with shame and confusion in regard to modesty and their own dignity  an indecent song having closed the first act the interval between that and the second is filled up with a dinner which with as much accuracy as the preceding business might be brought on the stage  the second act begins by m sarcasms instead of a servants announcing to the young lady the arrival of her other original lover squire groom from newmarket  in attempting to give a picturesque account of groomes person and attire who is come in the very jockey dress in which he had rode a match msarcasm says with his usual studied stupidity that he is come in aw his pontisicalibus  a jockey garb is a curtailed abridged and tight dress whereas the word pontisicalibus conveys the idea of an ample flowing and a pompous one and we might with as much justice say that a prelate in the full sweep and sway of his robe is in a trim jockey dress  msarcasm having discharged his packet relative to squire groom in order as it were to relieve guard enters mordecai with more news about him and the transaction between the irish and the newmarket heroes  on mordecais declaring that there is a warm contest between the two msarcasm expresses his joy in hopes of a speedy effusion of either irish or newmarket blood that of both would please him best so wicked and bloodyminded a rascal is he painted  his shortlived pleasure is soon converted into sorrow when mordecai informs him that their contest goes no farther than to try who will or can drink charlottes health in the greatest quantity of claret and that the challenge as he came from them had risen from one to a three pint bumper  such business would be much sitter scened in one of the taverns of covent garden purlieus than in the house of a sober and reputable merchant of london  gentlemen of that sedate class of life very seldom rather never permit such riotous doings in their houses which would be a very pernicious example for their servants etc and detrimental to their own characters  but trespasses of this kind are nothing to our confounding author who treats nature reason and decency with a total disregard and seems prosessedly to have made an experiment to know how far absurdity can be relished in the present too general depravity of taste  at last on comes or rather in tumbles squire groom hallooing like mad and drunk he begins by excusing himself to charlotte for not having come sooner and been time enough for dinner which he imputes to a brother bucks having borrowed his watch to set another by but that he put his  grooms two hours back which was the occasion of his error in time  he bids her ladyship look at it for that it regulates the sun and that they all stop by it at newmarket when asked by m sarcasm how soon he could come from york to london he answers that barring any accident of leg arm etc he would engage to do it in sixteen hours thirtysix minutes and seventeen seconds or thereabouts he makes some immaterial amendment of his calculation  the inquisitive m sarcasm ever studious to make his rivals expose their weak side entreats and obtains of him an account of the match he rode for and won groom from the exuberance of his heart tells it was a subscription  match for which each person had deposited so much every subscriber to ride his own beast  he enumerates the odds against him  turning to the lady he says a little after they set out she might have covered them all with her underpetticoat but that in a short time one of the match was run away with by his horse out of the course then rode over an exciseman two lawyers and a beau jew what an unnatural passion this preternatural author has for jew beans with such a chocolatecoloured phiz as mordecai  he then describes how he jockeyd the rest along the course and won the race  the words are the poorest commonplace language as all fudge etc used at every horsecourse  the acting is exquisite and even beyond the authors meaning it was the actor of groom that roused a torpisied yawning audience the first night and rescued it from damnation  no king no love a la mode  notwithstanding msarcasm o brallaghan and the israelite  msarcasm asks groom what had induced him to come and visit miss charlotte in that dress  he answers that the bloods of the turf all offered a bet that he would not ride to london and visit his mistress in the very jockey garb in which he had run the race  he took them all up and had consequently taken them all in as the saying is  msarcasm to lure him on affects to greatly admire his wonderful deeds upon which groom tells him that he had run a snail with his grace and won it hollow by half a horn  half a horn quoth the intelligent msarcasm that was hollow indeed then he is arch on to what a perfection the gentlemen of the south have brought all these matters  upon which groom exulting declares that he will ride a match fight a main of cocks drive an equipage or hunt a pack of hounds for a thousand guineas with any nobleman in europe and he says done first  o wonderful says fleering msarcasm to the lady he hunts all animals from the flea in the blanket to the elephant in the forest  this is certainly new  he is indeed madam a very nimrod yes i am a nimrod answers groom  it is too arduous a task to attempt unfolding the many latent beauties in this piece therefore it is to be hoped a few specimens will suffice  the reader may with reason ask but all this time what is become of sir callaghan why has he been deprived of hearing the description of groomes match  has he not been able to carry the bumpers that he had been drinking with groom to charlottes health or is he fallen asleep and tumbled under the table but in what room or part of the house we really do not know  it is agreed upon however that he is to be cited to the acting chamber to afford diversion to the lady and her lovers when groom hears of it he says with astonishment an irishman make love i should be glad to hear what an irishman can say when he makes love  msarcasm the jew and groom retire to a corner of the room to overhear and be diverted with o brallaghans addresses to the lady who is advised by msarcasm to ask him for his sonet which he protests will highly entertain her ladyship  besides the stupidity of the device what lady of the least education would cooperate to exhibit a woer her guardians nephew too for a ridiculous entertainment to his rivals whom she despises there are many courtezans would not consent to it in a brothel nay it is a brothel scheme where some of the company retired into another room see through holes cut in the partition the awkward addresses made to a woman by any particular person they mean to laugh at  but how can any thing of the kind be transacted in a reputable house  the lady being left alone and a clear stage for sir callaghan on he comes and all the reason he gives for his absence is that he was enjoying himself in a soliloquy about her though in the mean time there was a possibility of one of his rivals making advances in her esteem  she allows him but little time to apologize before she asks him for a song not for her entertainment alone but his rival hearers which is a violent proof of the authors knowledge of the behavior of women of polite education and rank  by the assistance of liquor he thinks himself better enabled to speak his mind to the lady  he would fain excuse himself from singing a song which she is put on to ask by m sarcasm and pleads the fear of having got at the wrong side of his voice but she persisting he prays her not to expect such good singing from him as the people of the operahouse because  irishmen are not cut out like the italians  this expression i am informed by scotch officers who have been on irish duty is a very old and hackneyd blackguardicism there  but it may be replied that is no exclusive reason against the qualified authors using it  let other men sing of their goddesses bright that darken the day and enlighten the night i sing of woman of such flesh and blood to touch but her finger would do ones heart good fall lal la etc   at the end of each stanza is introduced a dash of the irish howl which as mordecai has it he roars not sings  the song finished to the great satisfaction of the three listening rivals in the corner charlotte intimates a desire of her ardent lover o brallaghans remaining in case of their union at home with her and going no more to the army  he with two thrustin sentiments replies  he cannot with honor because that he had served his royal master and a brave one he is for seventeen years who gave him money when he had none of his own and that now he was come to a title and fortune to desert his service when he stands in most need would be the act of a poltroon  that it had ever been a rule with him never to abandon his king or his friend in distress  morality of this kind belongs to the ingenuous and nobleminded of every climate and is here strangely appropriated to irish teaguism as well as that in the first act   there are two things i am equally afraid of either to affront any man or being affronted myself and yet the irish in general are remarkable for irascibility and mistaking an affront where none had been meant  is it not surprising that our author who makes the most of every occasion has not given a panegyrical volley to the king of prussia to endear his piece the more to the crowd that would have been some little plea for the irishmans being a prussian officer  he might have extolled him above caesar hannibal alexander and declared them not worthy of being his aidesdecamp then what huzzaing and clapping from the upper regions  the lady declares against having to do with a military man leaves him as abruptly as she had exposed him basely  in amazement he says what does she quit the field  i will after strait and reconnoitre her   it being high time for all parties to have done their fools tricks and put a judicious period to this wonderful piece enter m sarcasm and mordecai observing to each other that the show is over that there are bailiffs in sir theodores house  sir theodore crosses the stage with an attorney and shows him to the ladys apartment to inform her of the loss of her lawsuit  she comes on in tears with sir theodore bidding him not to despond but to hope for the better  that she is sure sir archibald will make them happy the scot overhearing her says  she may as well rely on the philosophers stone  upon her application to him he tells her he has received letters  not only remonstrating but expressly prohibiting his contaminating a noble family by mixing with any thing sprung from sugarhogsheads and countinghouses  she closes her indignant answer with  there is no virtue in man   nor in woman either quoth the scot who has na fortune  he insultingly advises her to take up with the wandering israelite whom he treats with amplified abuse but the jew begs to be excused  in rushes squire groom roaring what the devil is the matter   why i hear sir theodore that you and the silly have run soul of the post  being informed of the ladys disaster he plays off too with a continuation of indecent newmarket allegory  on comes sir brallaghan who when ever off the stage seems as if he had been asleep and not to know any thing of what has happened in the house  where did he so hide himself  when told of charlotts misfortune as it was proper the dubbed hero should he declares that he loves her the better for it because while she was computed to be worth an hundred thousand pounds he could never come near her but in trembling  is this agreeable to some of his former declarations of attacking storming making a coup de main or dying upon the spot or the sense of the song which tags the first act in which he says he and his countrymen always make the fair and the bold surrender  her sentimental speeches on his behavior she knowing her situation not to be impaired is quite gratis  sir theodore tells sir callaghan  that to reward his manly virtue and to punish the other interested profligates who court ladies only for their fortunes that charlotte is as rich as ever  groom and mordecai appearing amazed msarcasm bids them be quiet that sir theodore says that to take in the irish feul who had three good qualities to make a husband   a good estate loved charlotte mightily and was a blockhead  sir callaghan addressing himself to sir theodore says   why really i do not know the importance of all this  i cannot believe one word you say one time you tell me miss charlotte has a fortune then she has no fortune  and after that she has a fortune again why this is like what the little jackanapess about town do and is called humbugging a man  when the reality of charlottes fortune is assured beyond a doubt the slung rivals express their uneasiness  groom cries out  why the knowingones are taken in here  msarcasm declares he will be revenged that he knows a lad of good family that understands the belles lettres and classics a stale joke against the scots and is actually writing a comedy and that he shall make the parties ridiculous by insinuating their characters  mordecai vows  he will write a satire and ascribe a scandalous intrigue to charlotte  groom to have vengeance swears  as he cannot write he will kill her parrot and cut off her squirrels tail  o brallaghan accosts them  pray gentlemen i hope you will ask my leave for all this if any of you touch a hair of the parrots head or write your scurrilous lampoons i will make remarks upon your bodies i carry a pen by my side that is a very good critic and writes legible characters to punish impertinent authors  m sarcasm tells him he has the lady and to be satisfied and not to talk in that bullying way for that others have as good swords as he  o brallaghan observes to charlotte  this is very like the catastrophe of a play where all the people are together when honest men are rewarded and knaves disappointed  thus ends love a la mode the prize is carried off by o brallaghan the jew scot and englishman baulked and abused what can be the tendency or moral instruction of this piece  it is pretty obvious without explaining it  postscript should this piece be proved a plagiarism a vampedup old irish farce how must many folks be surprised  some strollers from dublin brought over to edinburgh a farce where it was printed in the year      and is called the brave irishman  the chief business is that mr tradewell an eminent merchant of the city of london has an only child and heiress miss lucy courted by several woers whereof one is a frenchman monsiour ragou abused for his tawney complexion as mordecai is in love a la mode cheatly a principal agent an englishman is a most worthless rascal lays schemes to defeat the virtuous irishman captain o blunders courtship who is an officer in our service he commits as surprising but more natural bulls to such a character than sir callaghan and sings as many songs which the late unfledged bard has imitated thus one begins  wherever i am going and all the day long abroad or at home or alone in a throng i find that my passions so lively and strong that your name when i am silent still runs on my tongue in fine mr tradewel is made really to break and capt o blunder who is here also dubbed a man of estate declares he will marry miss lucy notwithstanding and that he is proud of having it in his power to make her and her father happy in spite of his bad fortune upon so kind an occasion this reply is put in the mouth of  miss lucy this generosity amazes and greatly prejudices me in favor of the honesty and goodness of the irish   capt o blunder oagh my dear little charmer my sweet creter i have another song just a propos of all the husbands living an irishmans the best with my fall lal lal etc no nation on the globe like him can stand the test with my fall lal etc the english they are drones as plainly you may see but we are all brisk and airy and lively as a be with my fall lal etc    thus ends the brave irishman from which the present stage casualty the author of accident and truly original genius of love a la mode has derived his plan thus milton is said to have taken the hint of his paradise lost from a puppetshew he had seen in italy  finis
