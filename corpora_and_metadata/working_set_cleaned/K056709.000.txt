lottery a musical entertainment part i scene i thyrsis recitative though lawless war has quenched her flaming brand that long too long has thinnd this frighted land though ceres heaps my loaded granries fill and my proud oxen graze on every hill yet my fond heart is filled with deepest cares for thyrsis loves and while he dotes despairs air what beauties does my nymph disclose less fair the silver lilly blows such blushes glow not on the rose as on the cheeks of phillis the other day upon the green i saw a nymph of heavenly mien i ran to greet the cyprian queen but found it was my phillis by mossy grot with ivy bound where fragrant woodbines curl around and daisies dapple over the ground i sit and murmur phillis and when the lark with dewy wings to hail the morn exulting springs i rise and tune the trembling strings to praise my dearest phillis when first i saw the lovely maid i gazed inrapturd and dismayed my faltring tongue was quite afraid to tell my pangs to phillis then cupid aimed his sharpest dart at once i felt the pleasing smart that very hour i lost my heart and now it dwells with phillis exit  scene ii daphne phillis daphne recit what still in tears cast every fear away tomorrow phillis is the first of may then as the custom of the place demands each ventring shepherd in due order stands and from the urn draws forth his future wife phillis

gentle love a shelter find if he forsake the breast of womankind air oh let me unreservd declare the dictate of my breast my thyrsis reigns unrivaled there an everwelcome guest no more our spritely nymphs i meet but seek the lonely grove there sighing to myself repeat some tender tale of love when absent from my longing sight he is my constant theme his shadowy form appears by night and shapes the morning dream ye spotless virgins of the plain deem not my words too free for ere my passion you arraign you must have loved like me exit  scene iii daphne recit unhappy girl i know the pangs of love and often sigh when in the silent grove my faithless traitor from my passion fled and left me weeping in a lonely bed henceforth my arts i will on their sex employ their vows my laughter and their pangs my joy air my pride is to hold all mankind in my chain the conquest i prize though the slaves i disdain i will teaze them and vex them i will plague and perplex them since men try all arts our weak sex to betray i will show them a womans as cunning as they young damon adored me and lycon the vain by turns i encouraged each amorous swain they knelt and they trembled i smiled and dissembled since men try all arts our weak sex to betray i will show them a womans as cunning as they then hear me ye nymphs and my counsel believe resist all their wiles the deceivers deceive their canting and whining their sighing and pining are all meant as baits our weak sex to betray then prove there are women as cunning as they  exit scene iv a grove colin discovered playing on his pipe air

harvests shall shine the olive her flowrets increase again purple clusters shall blush on the vine these these are the blessings of peace the shepherd securely now roams through the glade or merrily pipes in the vale the youth in soft numbers attempts his coy maid the virgins dance blithe in the dale the flowers with gay colors embroider the ground unpressd by an enemys feet the bleatings of sheep from the hillocks resound and the birds their trim sonnets repeat scene v to him thyrsis thyrsis recit thrice happy colin you the whole day long teach every hill to catch your jocund song so the blithe throstle carols through the grove his breast unwounded by the thorns of love  colin true thyrsis true i never could sigh and pine and call a proud denying fair divine each nymph i see has got some charm to strike and those who yield the soonest best i like  thyrsis as verdant fields the blasted heath surpass as generous corn exceeds the meaner grass as palms are nobler than the shrubs they shade so phillis triumphs over each other maid  colin i like young doris in her russet gown ripe as the pear and as the berry brown her ruddy cheeks the cherrys hue display and warm and buxom as a summers day  thysis tomorrow is the period of my fate my hopes my fears do on tomorrow wait then fortune gives me phillis for a wife or ends my every suffering with my life  colin ye lovers much profess and yet i am told ye seldom long the same opinion hold you knew young strephon he who on the ring  but hearken thyrsis i will the story sing air to dear amaryllis young strephon had long declared his fixed passion and died for in song he went one maymorning to meet in the grove by her own dear appointment this goddess of love meanwhile in his mind all her charms he ran over and doted on each can a lover do more he waited and waited then changing his strain twas fury and rage and despair and disdain the sun was commanded to hide his dull light and the whole course of nature was altered downright twas his hapless fortune to die and adore but never to change can a lover do more cleora it hapd was by accident there no rosebud so tempting no lilly so fair he pressed her white hand next her lips he essayed nor would she deny him so civil the maid her kindly compliance his peace did restore and dear amaryllis was thought of no more  scene vi thyrsis recit unhappy state of

betray then crown your poor phillis with willow the bloom which once graced has deserted this cheek my eyes no more sparkle my tongue can scarce speak my heart too so flutters i fear it will break then crown your poor phillis with willow ye lovers so true that attend on my bier and think that my fortune has proved too severe ah curb not the sigh nor refuse the kind tear then strew all the place round with willow erect me a tomb and engrave on its side here lies a poor maiden whose love was denied she strove to endure it but could not and died then shade it with cypress and willow  scene viii to her thyrsis thyrsis recit o lovely maiden dearer to my sight than the gay fires that gild the gloom of night here at your feet let me transported own how much i phillis love and her alone duet thyrsis when fairies dance round on the grass and revel to nights awful noon o say will you meet me sweet lass all by the clear light of the moon  phillis my passion i seek not to screen then can i refuse you your boon i will meet you at twelve on the green all by the clear light of the moon the nightingale perched on a thorn then charms all the plains with her tune and glad of the absence of morn salutes the pale light of the moon  thyrsis how sweet is the jessamin grove and sweet are the roses of june but sweeters the language of love breathed forth by the light of the moon too slow rolls the chariot of day unwilling to grant me my boon away envious sunshine away give place to the light of the moon  phyllis but say will you never deceive the lass whom you conquered too soon and leave a lost maiden to grieve alone by the light of the moon  thyrsis the planets shall start from their spheres ere i prove so fickle a loon believe me i will banish thy fears dear maid by the light

frown again air as soon hope for peace twixt the hawk and the dove as to find it with woman and man or prompted by hate or incited by love they both will deceive when they can the shepherd forgetful of oaths and of vows will run to a face that is more new and often the women or maiden or spouse the very same method pursue the youth to obtain the dear nymph he admires by falsehood expresses his flame to gain the loved boy who her bosom inspires does not cloe exactly the same how justs the division mans born to persuade we listen and think him sincere but then has not nature been kind to the maid she gave her the smile and the tear intrepid as heroes men snatch at their joy and force us by storm to comply we helpless poor creatures by fashion made coy consent when we feebly deny like armies drawn out into martial array the sexes call forth all their powers and if for the men goes the battle today tomorrow the triumph is ours recit but see young colin casts this way his look perhaps he means to bring another crook fain would i force him to receive my yoke and own that cupids laws are more than joke  scene iii to her colin colin sweet lady tell me did you see this way two

raptures know no end  colin joy to my thyrsis and to thee my fair the yoke is lasting that youre doomed to wear may love and hymen never be at odds for both are young and wondrous testy gods  thyrsis haste to the urn there there your fortune try  colin i humbly thank you but indeed not i this kind of lottry does not hit my taste a wife is no such mighty prize at last air how giddy is youth yet above all advice you counsel and counsel in vain i have tried what is wedlock and like it so well that i will never be married again the spouse that i pitched on was comely and young and sweet as the flowers of the plain she was wise as they tell me perhaps it might be but i will never be married again i saw the poor creature laid deep in the grave my tears they came pouring like rain but as sunshine you know will foul weather succeed i quickly recovered again like the castles of fairies it seems to the sight and fancy indulges the rein but alas when you try it it is all a mere cheat and the same dull tale over again  daphne recit once more well met polite engaging swain what maid but must adore thy soothing strain  duet o say must i sigh and pine my love o say must i sigh and pine

not much afraid my dear i am not much afraid  daphne since nothing i find will do my love since nothing i find will do my heart i will break  no i will live for your sake and i will live to laugh at you my love and live to laugh at you  thyrsis recit cease all your jars while we my gentle maid pursue true pleasure in the rosy shade but hasten swains your annual homage pay and hail with jolly sounds the youthful may air thyrsis now the snowdrop lifts her head cowflips rise from golden bed silver lillies paint the grove welcome may and welcome love  phillis hark the merry finches sing heralds of the blooming spring and the artless turtledove coes at once to may and love  thyrsis long the claycold maid denies nor regards her shepherds sighs now your fond petitions move mays the season formed for love  phillis while adown the slopy hill tinkles soft the gushing rill balmy scents perfume the grove may unbends the soul to love  daphne now the be on silvry wings flowery spoils unwearied brings spoils that nymphs and swains approve soft as may and sweet as love and the swallows chirping brood skim around the crystal flood then in wanton circlets rove playful as the god of love  colin on the fair that deck our isle may each grace and virtue smile and our happy shepherds prove days of ease and nights of love  exeunt omnes a dance of shepherds etc this song is sung by dorylas in the first scene of the second part after the words  at eight precisely i will my suit renew and was by mistake omitted air how happys the lover whose cares are no more who bids an adieu to
