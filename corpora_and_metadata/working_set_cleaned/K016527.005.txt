reprinted and sold by the booksellers m dcc liii  the history of sir charles grandison bart letter i sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna monday night may      i am just returned you will expect me to be particular  i went the earlier in the afternoon that i might pass half an hour with my jeronymo he complains of the aperture so lately made but mr lowther gives us hopes from it  when we were alone they will not let me see my sister said he i am sure she must be very bad but i understand that you are to be allowed that favor byandby o my grandison how i pity that tender that generous heart of yours  but what have you done to the general he assures me that he admires and loves you and the bishop has been congratulating me upon it he knew it would give me pleasure my dear grandison you subdue everybody yet in your own way for they both admire your spirit  just then came in the general he saluted me in so kind a manner that jeronymos eyes overflowed and he said blessed be god that i have lived to see you two dearest of men to me so friendly together  this sweet girl said the general  how grandison will you bear to see her  the bishop entered o chevalier my sister is insensible to everything and everybody camilla is nobody with her today  they had forgot jeronymo though in his chamber and their attention being taken by his audible sensibilities they comforted him and withdrew with me into mr lowthers apartment while mr lowther went to his patient  the marchioness joined us in tears this dear child knows me not heeds me not she never was unmindful of her mother before i have talked to her of the chevalier grandison she regards not your name o this affecting silence  camilla has told her that she is to see you my daughterinlaw has told her so o chevalier she has quite quite lost her understanding nay we were barbarous enough to try the name of laurana she was not terrified as she used to be with that  camilla came in with a face of joy lady clementina has just spoken i told her she must prepare to see the chevalier grandison in all his glory and that everybody the general in particular admired him go naughty camilla said she tapping my hand you are a wicked deceiver i have been told this story too often to credit it this was all i could get her to say  hence it was concluded that she would take some notice of me when she saw me and i was led by the general followed by the rest into the marchionesss drawing room  father marescotti had given me an advantageous character of the generals lady whom i had not yet seen the bishop had told me that she was such another excellent woman as his mother and like her had the italian reserve softened by a polite french education the marquis the count father marescotti and this real fine lady were in the drawingroom the general presented me to her i do not madam bid you admire the chevalier grandison but i forgive you if you do because you will not be able to do otherwise  my lord said she you told me an hour ago that i must and now that i see the chevalier you will have no cause to reproach me with disobedience  i bowed on her hand father marescotti madam said i bid me expect from the lady of the young marchese della porretta everything that was condescending and good your compassionate love for an unhappy new sister who deserves everyones love exalts your character  father marescotti came in we took our places it was designed i found to try to revive the young ladys attention by introducing her in full assembly i one of it but i could not forbear asking the marchioness if lady clementina would not be too much startled at so much company  i wish said the marquis sighing that she may be startled  we meet as only on a conversationvisit said the marchioness we have tried every other way to awaken her attention  we are all near relations said the bishop  and want to make our observations said the general  she has been bid to expect you among us resumed the marchioness we shall only be attended by laura and camilla  just then entered the sweet lady leaning upon camilla laura attending her movement was slow and solemn her eyes were cast on the ground her robes were black and flowing a veil of black gause half covered her face what woe was there in it  what at that moment was my emotion i arose from my seat sat down and arose again irresolute not knowing what i did or what to do  she stopped in the middle of the floor and made some motion in silence to camilla who adjusted her veil but she looked not before her lifted not up her eyes observed nobody  on her stopping i was advancing toward her but the general took my hand sit still sit still dear grandison said he yet i am charmed with your sensibility she comes she moves toward us  she approached the table round which we sat her eyes more than half closed and cast down she turned to go toward the window here here madam said camilla leading her to an elbowchair that had been placed for her between the two marchionesses she implicitly took her womans directions and sat down her mother wept the young marchioness wept her father sobbed and looked from her her mother took her hand my love said she look around you  pray sister said the count her uncle leave her to her own observation  she was regardless of what either said her eyes were cast down and half closed camilla stood at the back of her chair  the general grieved and impatient arose and stepping to her my dearest sister said he hanging over her shoulder look upon us all do not scorn us do not despise us see your father your mother your sister and everybody in tears if you love us smile upon us he took the hand which her mother had quitted to attend her own emotions  she reared up her eyes to him and sweetly condescending tried to smile but such a solemnity had taken possession of her features that she only could show her obligingness by the effort her smile was a smile of woe and still further to show her compliance withdrawing her hand from her brother she looked on either side of her and seeing which was her mother she with both hands took hers and bowed her head upon upon it  the marquis arose from his seat his handkerchief at his eyes sweet creature said he never never let me again see such a smile as that it is here putting his hand to his breast  camilla offered her a glass of limonade she accepted it not nor held up her head for a few moments  obliging sister you do not scorn us said the general see father marescotti is in tears the reverend man sat next me pity his gray hairs see my lord your own father too  comfort your father his grief for your silence   she cast her eyes that way she saw me saw me greatly affected she started she looked again again started and quitting her mothers hand now changing pale now reddening she arose and threw her arms about her camilla  o camilla was all she said a violent burst of tears wounding yet giving some ease to every heart i was springing to her and should have clasped her in my arms before them all but the general taking my hand as i reached her chair dear grandison said he pronouncing in her ear my name keep your seat if clementina remembers her english tutor she will bid you welcome once more to bologna  o camilla said she faithful good camilla now at last have you told me truth it is it is he  and her tears would flow as she hid her face in camillas bosom  the generals native pride again showed itself he took me aside i see grandison the consequence you are of to this unhappy girl every one sees it but i depend upon your honor you remember what you said this morning   good god said i with some emotion i stopped  and resuming with pride equal to his own know sir that the man whom you thus remind calls himself a man of honor and you as well as the rest of the world shall find him so  he seemed a little abashed i was flinging from him not too angrily for him but for the rest of the company had they not been attentive to the motions of their clementina  we however took the bishops eye he came to us  i left the general and the bishop led him out in order to enquire into the occasion of my warmth  when i turned to the company i found the dear clementina supported by the two marchionesses and attended by camilla just by me passing toward the door in order it seems at her motion to withdraw she stopped ah chevalier said she and reclining her head on her mothers bosom seemed ready to faint i took one hand as it hung down lifelessly extended her mother held the other and kneeling pressed it with my lips  forgive me ladies forgive me lady clementina  my soul overflowed with tenderness though the moment before it was in a tumult of another kind for she cast down her eyes upon me with a benignity that for a long time they all afterward owned they had not beheld i could not say more i arose she moved on to the door and when there turned her head straining her neck to look after me till she was out of the room i was a statue for a few moments till the count snatching my hand and father marescottis who stood nearest him we see to what the malady is owing  father you must join their hands  chevalier you will be a catholic  will you not  o that you would said the father  why why joined in the count did we refuse the soearnestly requested interview a year and half ago  the young marchioness returned weeping  they will not permit me to stay my sister my dear sister is in fits  o sir turning graciously to me you are  i will not say what you are  but i shall not be is danger of disobeying my lord on your account  just then entered the general led in by the bishop now brother said the latter if you will not be generous be however just  chevalier were you not a little hasty  i was my lord but surely the general was unseasonable  perhaps i was  there is as great a triumph my lord said i in a due acknowlegement as in a victory know me my lords as a man incapable of meanness who will assert himself but who from the knowledge he has of his own heart wishes at his soul to be received as the unquestionably disinterested friend of this whole family excuse me my lords i am obliged to talk greatly because i would not wish to act petulantly but my soul is wounded by those distresses which had not i am sorry to say it a little while ago a first place in your heart  do you reproach me grandison  i need not my lord if you feel it as such but indeed you either know not me or forget yourself and now having spoken all my mind i am ready to ask your pardon for anything that may have offended you in the manner i snatched his hand so suddenly i hope not rudely but rather fervently that he started  receive me my lord as a friend i will deserve your friendship  tell me brother said he to the bishop what i shall say to this strange man shall i be angry or pleased  be pleased my lord replied the prelate  the general embraced me  well grandison you have overcome i was unseasonable you were passionate let us forgive each other  his lady stood suspended not being able to guess at the occasion of this behavior and renewed friendship the count was equally surprised father marescotti seemed also at a loss the marquis had withdrawn  we sat down and reasoned variously on what had passed with regard to the unhappy lady according to the hopes and fears which actuated the bosoms of each but i cannot help thinking that had this interview been allowed to pass with less surprise to her she might have been spared those fits with the affecting description of which the young marchioness alarmed us till camilla came in with the happy news that she was recovering from them and that her mother was promising her another visit from me in hopes it would oblige her though it was not what she required  i took this opportunity to put into the hands of the young marchioness sealed up the opinions of the physicians i had consulted in england on the case of clementina requesting that she would give it to her mother in order to have it considered  the bishop withdrew to acquaint jeronymo in the way he thought best with what had passed in this first interview with his sister resolving not to take any notice of the little sally of warmth between the general and me  i hope to make the pride and passion of this young nobleman of use to myself by way of caution for am i not naturally too much inclined to the same fault o dr bartlett how have i regretted the passion i suffered myself to be betrayed into by the foolish violence of ohara and salmonet in my own house when it would have better become me to have had them showed out of it by my servants  and yet were i to receive affronts with tameness from those haughty spirits who think themselves of a rank superior to me and from men of the sword i who make it a principle not to draw mine but in my own defense should be subjected to insults that would be continually involving me in the difficulties i am solicitous to avoid  i attended the general and his lady to jeronymo the generous youth forgot his own weak state in the hopes he flattered himself with of a happy result to his sisters malady from the change of symptoms which had already taken place though violent hysterics disordered and shook her beforewounded frame  the general said that if she could overcome this first shock perhaps it was the best method that could have been taken to rouse her out of that stupidity and inattention which had been for some weeks so disturbing to them all  there were no hopes of seeing the unhappy lady again that evening the general would have accompanied me to the casino the casino at bologna is a fine apartment illuminated every night for the entertainment of the gentlemen and ladies of the city and whomever they please to introduce there are cardtables and waiters attend with chocolate coffee and ice the whole expense is defrayed by twelve men of the first quality each in turn taking his month  saying that we might both be diverted by an hour passed there but i excused myself my heart was full of anxiety for the welfare of a brother and sister both so much endeared to me by their calamities and i retired to my lodgings  letter ii sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna tuesday may      i had a very restless night and found myself so much indisposed in the morning with a feverish disorder that i thought of contenting myself with sending to know how the brother and sister rested and of staying within at least till the afternoon to give my hurried spirits some little repose but my messenger returned with a request from the marchioness to see me presently  i obeyed clementina had asked whether she had really seen me or had only dreamed so they took this for a favorable indication and therefore sent the above request  i met the general in jeronymos apartment he took notice that i was not very well mr lowther proposed to bleed me i consented i afterward saw my friends wounds dressed the three surgeons pronounced appearances not to be unfavourable  we all then retired into mr lowthers apartment the bishop introduced to us two of the faculty the prescriptions of the english physicians were considered and some of the methods approved and agreed to be pursued  clementina when i came was retired to her own apartment with camilla her terrors on lauranas cruelty had again got possession of her imagination and they thought it not advisable that i should be admitted into her presence till the hurries she was in on that account had subsided  but by this time being a little more composed her mother led her into her dressing room the geneneral and his lady were both present and by their desire i was asked to walk in  clementina when i entered was sitting close to camilla her head leaning on her bosom silent and seemingly thoughtful i bowed to her to the two marchionesses to the general she raised her head and looked toward me and clasping her arms about camillas neck hid her face in her bosom for a few moments then looking as bashful toward me she loosed her hands stood up and looked steadily at me and at camilla by turns several times as irresolute at last quitting camilla she moved toward me with a stealing pace but when near me turning short hurried to her mother and putting one arm about her neck the other held up she looked at me as if she were doubtful whom she saw she seemed to whisper to her mother but not to be understood she went then by her sisterinlaw who took her hand as she passed her with both hers and kissed it and coming to the general who sat still nearer me and who had desired me to attend to her motions she stood by him and looked at me with a sweet irresolution  as she had stolen such advances toward me i could no longer restrain myself i arose and taking her hand behold the man said i with a bent knee whom once you honored with the name of tutor your english tutor  know you not the grateful grandison whom all your family have honored with their regard  o yes  yes  i think i do  they rejoiced to hear her speak  but where have you been all this time  in england madam  but returned lately returned to visit you and your jeronymo  jeronymo one hand held up the other not withdrawn poor jeronymo  god be praised said the general some faint hopes the two marchionesses wept for joy  your jeronymo madam and my jeronymo is we hope in a happy way do you love jeronymo  do i  but what of jeronymo i dont understand you  jeronymo now you are well will be happy  am i well ah sir  but save me save me chevalier  faintly screaming and looking about her with a countenance of woe and terror  i will save you madam the general will also protect you of whom are you afraid  o the cruel cruel laurana  she withdrew her hand in a hurry and lifted up the sleeve of the other arm  you shall see  o i have been cruelly used  but you will protect me forbearing to show her arm as she seemed to intend  laurana shall never more come near you  but dont hurt her  come sit down by me and i will tell you all i have suffered  she hurried to her former seat and sat down by her weeping camilla i followed her she motioned to me to sit down by her  why you must know chevalier  she paused  ah my head putting her hand to it  well but now you must leave me something is wrong  leave me  i dont know myself   then looking with a face of averted terror at me  you are not the same man i talked to just now  who are you sir  she again faintly shrieked and threw her arms about camillas neck once more hideing her face in her bosom  i could not bear this not very well before it was too much for me i withdrew  dont withdraw chevalier said the general drying his eyes  i withdrew however to mr lowthers chamber he not being there i shut the door upon myself  so oppressed my dear dr bartlett i was greatly oppressed  recovering myself in a few moments i went to jeronymo i had but just entered his chamber when the general who seemed unable to speak took my hand and in silence led me to his mothers dressingroom as we entered it she enquires after you chevalier said he and laments your departure she thinks she has offended you thank god she has recollection  when i went in she was in her mothers arms her mother soothing her and weeping over her  see see my child the chevalier you have not offended him  she quitted her mothers arms i approached her i thought it was not you that sat by me a while ago but when you went away from me i saw it could be nobody but you why did you go away was you angry  i could not be angry madam you bid me leave you and i obeyed  well but now what shall i say to him madam i dont know what i would say you madam stepping with a hasty motion toward her sisterinlaw will not tell laurana anything against me  unhappy hour said her mother speaking to the general that i ever yielded to her going to the cruel laurana  the marchioness took her hand i hate laurana my dear i love nobody but you  dont hate her however  chevalier whisperingly who is this lady  the general rejoiced at the question for this was the first time she had ever taken any particular notice of his lady or enquired who she was notwithstanding her generous tenderness to her  that lady is your sister your brother signor giacomos wife   my sister how can that be  where has she been all this time  your sister by marriage your elder brothers wife  i dont understand it but why madam did you not tell me so before i wish you happy laurana would not let me be her cousin will you own me  the young marchioness clasped her arms about her my sister my friend my dear clementina call me your sister and i shall be happy  what strange things have come to pass  how did these dawnings of reason rejoice every one  sir turning to the general let me speak with you  she led him by the hand to the other end of the room  let nobody hear us said she yet spoke not low what had i to say  i had something to say to you very earnestly i dont know what   well dont puzzle yourself my dear to recollect it said the general your new sister loves you she is the best of women she is the joy of my life love your new sister my clementina  so i will dont i love everybody  but you must love her better than any other woman the best of mothers excepted she is my wife and your sister and she loves both you and our dear jeronymo  and nobody else does she love nobody else  whom else would you have her love  i dont know but everybody i think for i do  whomever you love she will love she is all goodness  why that is well i will love her now i know who she is but sir i have some notion   of what my dear  i dont know but pray sir what brings the chevalier over hither again  to comfort you your father mother jeronymo to comfort us all to make us all well and happy in each other  why that is very good dont you think so but he was always good are you brother happy  i am and should be more so if you and jeronymo were  but that can never never be  god forbid my sister the chevalier has brought over with him a skilful man who hopes to cure our jeronymo   has the chevalier done this why did he not do so before  the general was a little disconcerted but generously said we were wrong we took not right methods i for my part wish we had followed his advice in everything  bless me  holding up one hand how came all these things about sir sir with quickness  i will come again presently  and was making to the door  camilla stepped to her  whither whither my dear young lady  o camilla will do as well  camilla laying her hand upon her shoulder go to father marescotti  tell him  there she stopped then proceeding tell him i have seen a vision  he shall pray for us all  then stepping to her mother and taking her passive hand she kissed it and stroked her own forehead and cheek with it  love me madam love your child you dont know neither do i what ails my poor head heal it heal it with your gentle hand again stroking her forehead with it then putting it to her heart  the marchioness kissing her forehead made her face wet with her tears  shall i said camilla go to father marescotti  no said the general except she repeats her commands perhaps she has forgot him already  she said no more of father marescotti  the marchioness thinks that she had some confused notions of the former enmity of the general and father to me and finding the former reconciled wanted the father to be so too and to pray for us all  i was willing my dear dr bartlett to give you minutely the workings of the poor ladys mind on our two first interviews everybody is rejoiced at so hopeful an alteration already  we all thought it best now that she had so surprisingly taken a turn from observing a profound silence to free talking and shown herself able with very little incoherence to pursue a discourse that she should not exhaust herself and camilla was directed to court her into her own dressing room and endeavor to engage her on some indifferent subjects i asked her leave to withdraw she gave it me readily with these words i shall see you again i hope before you go to england  often i hope very often answered the general for me  that is very good said she and courtesying to me went up with camilla  we all went into jeronymos apartment and the young marchioness rejoiced him with the relation of what had passed that generous friend was for ascribing to my presence the hopedfor happy alteration while the general declared that he never would have her contradicted for the future in any reasonable request she should make  the count her uncle and signor sebastiano his eldest son are set out for urbino they took leave of me at my lodgings he hoped he said that all would be happy and that i would be a catholic  i have received a large packet of letters from england  i approve of all you propose my dear dr bartlett you shall not you say be easy except i will inspect your accounts dont refuse to give your own worthy heart any satisfaction that it can receive by consulting your true friend but otherwise you need not ask my consent to anything you shall think sit to do of one thing methinks i could be glad that only such children of the poor as show a peculiar ingenuity have any great pains taken with them in their books husbandry and labor are what are most wanting to be encouraged among the lower class of people providence has given to men different geniuss and capacities for different ends and that all might become useful links of the same great chain let us apply those talents to labor those to learning those to trade to mechanics in their different branches which point out the different pursuits and then no person will be unuseful on the contrary every one may be eminent in some way or other learning of itself never made any man happy the ploughman makes fewer mistakes in the conduct of life than the scholar because the sphere in which he moves is a more contracted one but if a genius arises let us encourage it there will be rustics enough to do the common services for the finer spirits and to carry on the business of the world if we do not by our own indiscriminate good offices contribute to their misapplication  i will write to congratulate lord w and his lady i rejoice exceedingly in their happiness  i will also write to my beauchamp and to lady beauchamp to give her joy on her enlarged heart surely dr bartlett human nature is not so bad a thing as some disgracers of their own species have imagined i have on many occasions found that it is but applying properly to the passions of persons who though they have not been very remarkable for benevolence may yet be induced to do right things in some manner if not always in the most graceful but as it is an observation that the misers feast is often the most splendid so may we say as in the cases of lord w and lady beauchamp the one to her soninlaw the other to his lady and nieces that when such persons are brought to taste the sweets of a generous and beneficent action they are able to behave greatly we should not too soon and without making proper applications give up persons of ability or power upon conceptions of their general characters and then with the herd set our faces against them as if we knew them to be invincible how many ways are there to overcome persons who may not however be naturally beneficent policy a regard for outward appearances ostentation love of praise will sometimes have great influences and not seldom is the requester of a favor himself in fault who perhaps shows as much self in the application as the refuser does in the denial  let charlotte know that i will write to her when she gives me a subject  i will write to lord and lady l by the next mail to write to either is to write to both  i have already answered emilys favor i am very glad that her mother and her mothers husband are so wife as to pursue their own interests in their behavior to that good girl and their happiness in their conduct to each other  my poor cousin grandison  i am concerned for him i have a very affecting letter from him but i see the proud man in it valuing himself on his knowledge of the world and rather vexed to be overreached by the common artifices of some of the worst people in it than from right principles i know not what i can do for him except i were on the spot i am grieved that he has not profited by other mens wisdom i wish he may by his own experience i will write to him yet neither to reproach him nor to extenuate his folly though i wish to free him from the consequences of it  i write to my aunt eleanor to congratulate and welcome her to london i hope to find her there on my return from italy  the unhappy sir hargrave the still unhappier merceda what sport have they made of their health in the prime of their days and with their reputation how poor would have been their triumph had they escaped by a flight so ignominious the due reward of their iniquitous contrivances but to meet with such a disgraceful punishment and so narrowly to escape a still more disgraceful one  tell me can the poor men look out into open day  but poor bagenhall sunk as he is almost beneath pity what can be said of him  we see dr bartlett in the behavior and sordid acquiescence with insults of these three men that offensive spirits cannot be true ones  if you have any call or inclination to go to london i am sure you will look in upon the little oldhams and their mother  my compliments to the young officer i am glad he is pleased with what has been done for him  i have letters from paris i am greatly pleased with what is done and doing there in pursuance of my directions relating to the moiety of  000 l left by the good mr danby to be disposed of at the discretion of his executor either in france or england as he gained a great part of his considerable fortune in france i think it would have been agreeable to him to find out there half of the objects of his benevolence why else named he france in his will  the intention of the bequeather in doubtful cases ought always to be considered and another case has offered which i think as there is a large surplus in my hands after having done by his relations more than they expected and full as much as is necessary to put them in a flourishing way i ought to consider in that light  mr danby at his setting out in life owed great obligations to a particular family then in affluent circumstances this family fell by unavoidable accidents into decay its descendents were numerous mr danby used to confer on no less than six granddaughters and four grandsons of this family an annual bounty which kept them just above want and he had put them in hopes that he would cause it to be continued to them as long as they were unprovided for the elder girls were in services the younger were brought up to be qualified for the same useful way of life the sons were neither idle nor vicious i cannot but think that it was his intention to continue his bounty to them by his last will had he not forgot them when he gave orders for drawing it up which was not till he thought himself in a dying way  proper enquiries have been made and this affair is settled the numerous family think themselves happy and the supposed intention of my deceased friend is fully answered and no legatee a sufferer  you kindly my dear dr bartlett regret the distance we are at from each other i am the loser by it and not you since i give you by pen and ink almost as minute an account of my proceedings as i could do were we conversing together such are your expectations upon and such is the obedience of  your everaffectionate and filial friend charles grandison  letter iii sir charles grandison in continuation june      we have now thank god some hopes of our jeronymo the opening made below the great wound answers happily its intention and that in the shoulder is once more in a fine way  lady clementina has been made to understand that he is better and this good news and the method she is treated with partly in pursuance of the advice of the english physicians leave us not without hopes of her recovery  the general and his lady are gone to naples in much higher spirits than when they left that city his lady seconding his earnest invitation i was not able to deny them the promise of a visit there  every one endeavors to sooth and humor lady clementina and the whole family is now satisfied that this was the method which always ought to have been taken with her and lay to the charge of lady sforza and laurana perhaps much deeper views than they had at first though they might enlarge them afterward and certainly did extend them when the poor lady was deemed irrecoverable  let me account to you my dear friend for my silence of near a month since the date of my last  for a fortnight together i was every day once with lady clementina she took no small pleasure in seeing me she was very various all that time in her absences sometimes she had sensible intervals but they were not durable she generally rambled much and was very incoherent sometimes she fell into her silent fits but they seldom lasted long when i came sometimes she aimed to speak to me in english but her ideas were too much unfixed and her memory too much shattered to make herself understood for a sentence together in the tongue she had so lately learned and for some time disused yet on the whole her reason seemed to gather strength it was a heavy fortnight to me and the heavier as i was not very well myself  yet i was loath to forbear my daily visits  mrs beaumont at the fortnights end made the family and me a visit of three days in that space lady clementinas absences were stronger but less frequent than before  i had by letter been all this time preparing the persons who had the management of mr jervoiss affairs to adjust finally the account relating to his estate which remained unsettled and they let me know that they were quite ready to put the last hand to them it was necessary for me to attend those gentlemen in person and as mrs beaumont could not conveniently stay any longer than the three days i acquainted the marchioness that i should do myself the honor of attending her to florence  as well mrs beaumont as the marchioness and the bishop thought i should communicate my intention and the necessity of pursuing it to lady clementina lest on her missing me she should be impatient and we should lose the ground we had gained  i laid before the young lady in presence of her mother and mrs beaumont in a plain and simple manner my obligation to leave her for a few days and the reason for it to florence said she does not lady olivia live at florence  she does usually answered mrs beaumont but she is abroad on her travels  well sir it is not for me to detain you if you have business but what will become of my poor jeronymo in the mean time  but before i could answer what a silly question is that i will be his comforter  father marescotti just then entered  o father rambled the poor lady you have not prayed with me for a long time o sir i am an undone creature i am a lost soul  she fell on her knees and with tears bemoaned herself  she endeavored after this to recollect what she had been talking of before we make it a rule not to suffer her if we can help it to puzzle and perplex herself by aiming at recollection and therefore i told her what was our subject she fell into it again with cheerfulness  well sir and when may jeronymo expect you again  in about ten days i told her and taking her hint i added that i doubted not but she would comfort signor jeronymo in my absence she promised she would and wished me happy  i attended mrs beaumont accordingly i concluded to my satisfaction all that remained unadjusted of my emilys affairs in two days after my arrival at florence i had a happy two days more with mrs beaumont and the ladies her friends and i stole a visit out of the ten days to the count of belvedere at parma  this excursion was of benefit to my health and having had a letter from mr lowther as i had desired at modena in my way to parma with very favorable news in relation both to the sister and brother i returned to bologna and met with a joyful reception from the marquis his lady the bishop and jeronymo who all joined to give me a share in the merit that was principally due to mr lowther and his assistants with regard to the brothers amendment and to their own soothing methods of treating the beloved sister who followed strictly the prescriptions of her physicians  i was introduced to lady clementina by her mother attended only by camilla the young lady met me at the entrance of her antechamber with a dignity like that which used to distinguish her in her happier days you are welcome chevalier said she but you kept not your time i have set it down pulling out her pocketbook  ten days madam i told you ten days i am exactly to my time  you shall see that i cannot be mistaken smiling but her smiles were not quite her own  she referred me to her book you have reckoned two days twice over madam see here   is it possible  i once sir was a better accomptant well but we will not stand upon two days in so many i have taken great care of jeronymo in your absence i have attended him several times and would have seen him oftener but they told me there was no need  i thanked her for her care of my friend   that is good enough said she to thank me for the care of myself jeronymo is myself  signor jeronymo replied i cannot be dearer to his sister than he is to me  you are a good man returned she and laid her hand upon my arm i always said so but chevalier i have quite forgot my english i shall never recover it what happy times were those when i was innocent and was learning english  my beloved young lady said camilla was always innocent  no camilla  no  and then she began to ramble  and taking camilla under the arm whispering let us go together to that corner of the room and pray to god to forgive us you camilla have been wicked as well as i  she went and kneeled down and held up her hands in silence then rising she came to her mother and kneeled to her her hands lifted up  forgive me forgive your poor child my mamma  god bless my child rise my love  i do forgive you  but do you forgive me tears trickling down her cheeks for ever suffering you to go out of my own sight for delivering you into the management of less kind and less indulgent relations  and god forgive them too rising some of them made me crazy and then upbraided me with being so god forgive them i do  she then came to me and to my great surprise dropped down on one knee i could not for a few moments tell what to do or what to say to her her hands held up her fine eyes supplicating  pray sir forgive me  humor humor the dear creature chevalier said her mother sobbing  forgive you madam  forgive you dear lady for what  you have not offended you could not offend  i raised her and taking her hand pressed it with my lips now madam forgive me  for this freedom forgive me  o sir i have given you i have given everybody trouble  i am an unhappy creature and god and you are angry with me  and you will not say you forgive me  humor her chevalier  i do i do forgive you most excellent of women  she hesitated a little then turned round to camilla who stood at a distance weeping and running to her cast herself into her arms hiding her face in her bosom  hide me hide me camilla what have i done  i have kneeled to a man  she put her arm under camillas and hurried out of the room with her  her mother seeing me in some consusion rejoice with me chevalier said she yet weeping that we see though her reason is imperfect such happy symptoms our child will i trust in god he once more our own and you will be the happy instrument of restoring her to us  the marquis and the bishop were informed of what had passed they also rejoiced in these further daybreaks as i may call them of their clementinas reason accompanied with that delicacy that never in so innocent a mind can be separated from it  you will observe my dear dr bartlett that i only aim to give you an account of the greater and more visible changes that happen in the mind of this unhappy lady omitting those conversations between her and her friends in which her situation varied but little from those before described by this means you will be able to trace the steps to that recovery of her reason which we presume to hope will be the return to our fervent prayers and humble endeavors  letter iv sir charles grandison in continuation bologna june      the conte della porretta and the two young lords sebastiano and juliano came hither yesterday to rejoice on the hopeful prospects before us  i thought i saw a little shiness and reserve sit upon the brow of the marchioness which i had not observed till the arrival of the count a complaisance that was too civil for friendship for our friendship i never permit a cloud to hang for one hour upon the brow of a friend without examining into the reason of it in hopes it may be in my power to dispel it an abatement in the freedom of one i love is a charge of unworthiness upon me that i must endeavor to obviate the moment i suspect it i desired a private audience of the good lady  she favored me with it at the first word but as soon as i had opened my heart to her she asked if father marescotti who loved me she said as if i were his own son might be allowed to be present at our conversation i was a little startled at the question but answered by all means  the father was sent to and came tender concern and reserve were both apparent in his countenance this showed that he was apprised of the occasion of the marchionesss reserve and expected to be called upon or employed in the explanation had i not demanded it  i repeated before him what i had said to the marchioness of the reserve that i had thought i saw since yesterday in one of the most benign countenances in the world  chevalier said she if you think that every one of our family as well those of urbino and naples as those of this place do not love you as one of their own family you do not do us justice  she then enumerated and exaggerated their obligations to me i truly told her that i could not do less than i had done and answer it to my own heart  leave us replied she to judge for ourselves on this subject and for gods sake do not think us capable of ingratitude we begin with pleasure to see the poor child after a course of sufferings and distresses that few young creatures have gone through reviving to our hopes she must in gratitude in honor in justice be yours if you require her of us and upon the terms you have formerly proposed  i think so said the father  what can i say proceeded she we are all distressed i am put upon a task that grieves me ease my heart chevalier by sparing my speech  explain yourself no further madam i fully understand you i will not impute ingratitude to any heart in this family tell me father marescotti if you can allow for me as i could for you were you in my circumstances and you cannot be better satisfied in your religion than i am in mine tell me by what you could do what i ought  there is no answering a case so strongly put replied the father but can a false religion an heresy persuade an ingenuous mind as strongly as the true  dear father marescotti you know you have said nothing it would sound harshly to repeat your own question to you yet that is all i need to do but let us continue our prayers that the desirable work may be perfected that lady clementina may be quite recovered you have seen madam that i have not offered to give myself consequence with her you see the distance i have observed to her you see nothing in her not even in her most afflicting resveries that can induce you to think she has marriage in view as i told your ladyship at first i have but one wish at present and that is her perfect recovery  what father can we say resumed the marchioness advise us chevalier you know our situation but do not do not impute ingratitude to us our childs salvation in our own opinion is at stake  if she be yours she will not be long a catholic  once more advise us  you generously i know madam think you speak in time both for the young ladys sake and mine you say she shall be mine upon the terms i formerly offered if i insist upon it i have told the general that i will have the consent of all three brothers as well as yours madam and your good lords or i will not hope for the honor of your alliance and i have declared to you that i look upon myself as bound upon you all as free if you think that the sense of supposed obligation as lady clementina advances in her health may engage her further than you wish let me decline my visits by degrees in order to leave her as disengaged as possible in her own mind and that i may not be thought of consequence to her recovery in the first place i will make my promised visit to the general you see she was not the worse but perhaps the better for my absence of ten days i will pass twenty if you please at rome and at naples holding myself in readiness to return post at the first call let us determine nothing in the interim depend upon the honor of a man who once more assures you that he looks upon himself as bound and the lady free and who will act accordingly by her and all your family  they were both silent and looked upon each other  what say you madam to this proposal what say you father marescotti could i think of a more disinterested one i would make it  i say you are a wonderful man  i have not words resumed the lady  she wept hard hard fate the man that of all men   there she stopped the father was present or perhaps she had said more  shall we said she acquaint jeronymo with this conversation  it may disturb him replied i you know madam his generous attachment to me i have promised the general a visit signor jeronymo was as much pleased with the promise as with the invitation the performance will add to his pleasure he may get more strength lady clementina may be still better and you will from events so happy be able to resolve still he pleased to remember that i hold myself bound yourselves to be free  yet i thought at the time with a concern that perheps was too visible when when shall i meet with the returns which my proud heart challenges as its due but then my pride shall i call it came in to my relief  great god i thank thee thought i that thou enablest me to do what my conscience what humanity tells me is fit and right to be done without taking my measures of right and wrong from any other standard  father marescotti saw me affected tears stood in his eyes he withdrew to conceal his emotion the marchioness was still more concerned she called me the most generous of men i took a respectful leave and withdrew to jeronymo  as i was intending to return to my lodgings in order to try to calm there my disturbed mind the marquis and his brother and the bishop sent for me into the marchionesss drawing room where were she and father marescotti who had acquainted them with what had passed between her himself and me  the bishop arose and embraced me  dear grandison said he how i admire you  why why will you not let me call you brother  were a prince your competitor and you would be a catholic   o that you would said the marchioness her hands and eyes lifted up  and will you not can you not said the count  that my lord is a question kindly put as it shows your regard for me  but it is not to be answered now  the marquis took my hand he applauded the disinterestedness of my behavior to his family he approved of my proposal of absence but said that i must myself undertake to manage that part not only with their clementina but with jeronymo whose grateful heart would otherwise be uneasy on a surmise that the motion came not from myself but them  we will not rosolve upon any measures said he god continue and improve our prospects and the result we will leave to his providence  i went from them directly to jeronymo and told him my intention of setting out for rome and naples in discharge of my promise to the general and his lady  he asked me what would become of clementina in the mean time was there not too great a danger that she would go back again  i told him i would not go but with her approbation i pleaded my last absence of ten days in favor of my intention her recovery said i must be a work of time if i am of the consequence your friendship for me supposes her attention will probably be more engaged by short absences and the expectations raised by them than by daily visits i remember not my dear jeronymo continued i a single instance that could induce any one to imagine that your clementinas regard for the man you favor was a personal one friendship never lighted up a purer flame in a human heart than in that of your sister was not the future happiness of the man she esteemed the constant i may say the only object of her cares in the height of her malady did she not declare that were that great article but probably secured she would resign her life with pleasure  true very true clementina is an excellent creature she ever was and you only can deserve her o that she could be now worthy of you but are my father mother brother willing to part with you do they not for clementinas sake make objections  the last absence fitting so easy on her mind they doubt not but frequent absences may excite her attention  well well i acquiesce the general and his lady will rejoice to see you i must not be too selfish god preserve you wherever you go  only let not the gentle heart of clementina be wounded by your absence dont let her miss you  tomorrow replied i i will consult her she shall determine for me  letter v sir charles grandison in continuation june      having the honor of an invitation to a conversationvisit to the cardinal legate and to meet there the gonfalonier i went to the palace of porretta in the morning  after sitting about half an hour with my friend jeronymo i was admitted to the presence of lady clementina her father mother and the bishop were with her clementina chevalier said her mother was enquiring for you she is desirous to recover her english are you willing sir to undertake your pupil again  ay chevalier said the young lady those were happy times and i want to recover them i want to be as happy as i was then  you have not been very well madam and is it not better to defer our lectures for some days till you are quite established in your health  why that is the thing i know i have been very ill i know that i am not yet quite well and i want to be so and that is the reason that i would recover my english  you will soon recover it madam when you begin but at present the thought the memory it would require you to exert would perplex you i am afraid the study would rather retard than forward your recovery  why now i did not expect this from you sir my mamma has consented  i did my dear because i would deny you nothing that your heart was set upon but the chevalier has given you such good reasons to suspend his lectures that i wish you would not be earnest in your request  but i cannot help it madam i want to be happy  well madam let us begin now what english book have you at hand  i dont know but i will fetch one  she stepped out camilla after her and poor lady forgetting her purpose brought down some of her own work the first thing that came to hand out of a drawer that she pulled out in her dressing room instead of looking into her bookcase it is an unfinished piece of noahs ark and the rising deluge the execution admirable and coming to me i wonder where it has lain all this time are you a judge of womens works chevalier  she went to the table  come hither and sit down by me i did madam to her mother my lord to her brother for the marquis withdrew in grief upon this instance of her wandering come and sit down by the chevalier and me they did she spread it on the table and in an attentive posture her elbow on the table her head on one hand pointing with the finger of the other  now tell me your opinion of this work  i praised as it deserved the admirable finger of the workwoman do you know that is mine sir said she but tell me everybody can praise do you see no fault  i think that is one said i and pointed to a disproportion that was pretty obvious  why so it is i never knew you to be a flatterer  men who can find faults more gracefully said the bishop than others praise need not flatter why that is true said she she sighed i was happy when i was about this work and the drawing was my own too after  after  i forget the painter  but you think it tolerable  do you  i think it upon the whole very fine if you could rectify that one fault it would be a masterpiece  well i think i will try since you like it she rolled it up  camilla let it be put on my toilette i am glad the chevalier likes it but sir if i am not at a loss for my head is not as it should be   poor lady she lost what she was going to say  she paused as if she would recollect it  do you know at last said she what is the matter with my head putting her hand to her sorehead  such a strange confusion just here and so stupid she shut her eyes she laid her head on her mothers shoulder who dropped an involuntary tear on her forehead  the bishop was affected can you can you chevalier whispered he suppose this dear creatures reason in your power and yet withold it from her  ah my lord said i how cruel  she raised her head and taking her mothers and camillas offered salts smelt to them in turn  i think i am a little better were you chevalier ever in such a strange way  i hope not  god preserve all people from being as i have been  why now you are all affected why do you all weep what have i said god forbid that i should afflict anybody  ah chevalier and laid her hand upon my arm god will bless you i always said you were a tenderhearted man god will pity him that can pity another  but brother my lord i have not been at church of a long time have i how long is it  where is the general where is my uncle  laurana poor laurana god forgive her she is gone to answer for all her unkindness  and she said she was sorry did she  thus rambled the poor lady what my dear dr bartlett can be more affecting than these absences these resveries of a mind once so sound and sensible  she withdrew at her own motion with camilla and we had no thoughts of communicating to her at that time my intentional absence but as i was about taking my leave for the day camilla came into jeronymos chamber where i was and told me that her young lady was very sedate and desired to see me if i were not gone  she led me into clementinas dressing room where was present her mother only who said she thought i might apprise her daughter of my proposed journey to naples and she herself began the subject  my dear said she the chevalier has been acquainting my lord and me with an engagement he is under to visit your brother giacomo and his lady at naples  that is a vast journey said she  not for the chevalier my dear he is used to travel  only for a visit  is it not better sir for you to stay here where everybody loves you  the general my dear and his lady love the chevalier  may be so but did you promise them sir  i did madam  why then you must perform your promise but it was not kind in them to engage you  why so my dear asked her mother  why so why what will poor jeronymo do for his friend  jeronymo has confented my dear he thinks the journey will do the chevalier good  nay then  will the journey do you good sir if it will i am sure jeronymo would not for the world detain you  are you willing my dear that the chevalier should go  yes surely madam if it will do him good i would lay down my life to do him good can we ever requite him for his goodness toward us  grateful heart said her mother tears in her eyes  gratitude piety sincerity and every duty of the social life are constitutional virtues in this lady no disturbance of mind can weaken much less efface them  shall you not want to see him in his absence  perhaps i may but what then if it be for his good you know   suppose my dear we could obtain the favor of mrs beaumonts company while the chevalier is gone  i should be glad  mrs beaumont is all goodness said i i will endeavor to engage her i can go by sea to naples and then florence will be in my way  florence ay and then you may see olivia too you know  olivia is not in italy madam she is on her travels  nay i am not against your seeing olivia if it will do you good to see her  you dont love olivia my dear said her mother  why not much  but will you send mrs beaumont to keep me company  i hope madam i may be able to engage her  and how long shall you be gone  if i go by sea i shall return by the way of rome and shall make my absence longer or shorter as i shall hear how my jeronymo does or as he will or will not dispense with it  that is very good of you  but but  suppose  a sweet blush overspread her face  i dont know what i would say  but for jeronymos sake dont stay longer than will do you good no need of that you know  sweet creature said the mother  did you call me so madam wrapping her arms about her and hiding her faintlyblushing face in her bosom then raising it up her arms still folded about her mother as long as i have my mamma with me i am happy dont let me be sent away from you again my mamma i will do everything you bid me do i never was disobedient  was i fie upon me if i was  no never never my dearest life  so i hoped for when i knew nothing this i used to say over my beads gracious father let me never forget my duty to thee and to my parents i was afraid i might as i remembered nothing  but that was partly owing to laurana poor laurana she has now answered for it i would pray her out of her pains if i could yet she did torment me  she has entertained a notion that laurana is dead and as it has removed that terror which she used to have at her very name they intend not to undeceive her but dr bartlett well or ill did you ever know a more excellent creature  well sir and so you must go  she quitted her mother and with a dignity like that which used to distinguish her she turned to me and gracefully waveing one hand while she held up the other  god preserve you wherever you go you must go from friend to friend were it all the world over you will let jeronymo hear often from you  will not you  pray do and i will in every visit i make to him enquire when he heard from his friend adieu sir adieu  i had not intended then to take my leave of her but as she anticipated me i thought it right to do so and respectively bowing on her hand withdrew followed by her eyes and her blessings  i went to jeronymo the marchioness came to me there and was of opinion with me that i should take this as a farewell visit to her clementina and tomorrow sooner by two days than i intended i propose to set out for florence in hopes to engage for them mrs beaumonts company of which they are all extremely desirous  i took my leave of the whole family and mr lowther who will write to me at all opportunities and perhaps you will not for some weeks hear further from  your everoffectionate charles grandison  letter vi miss byron to lady g thursday may    i write on purpose to acquaint you that i have had a visit from lady olivia she dined with me and is just set out for northampton we all joined in the most cordial manner to entreat her to favor us with her company till morning but she was not to be prevailed upon every one of us equally admires and pities her indeed she is a finer woman than you lady g would allow her to be in the debate between us in town on that subject  after dinner she desired a quarter of an hours discourse with me alone we retired into the cedar parlour  she opened as she said her whole heart to me what an hatred has she to the noble lady clementina she sometimes frighted me by her threatenings  poor unwomanly lady  i took the liberty to blame her i told her she must excuse me it was ever my way with those i respected  she would fain have got me to own that i loved sir charles grandison i acknowledged gratitude and esteem  but as there are no prospects hopes i had like to have said i would go no further but she was sure it was so i did say and i am in earnest that i never could be satisfied with a divided heart she clasped me in her arms upon this and put her cheek to my forehead  she told me that she admired him for his virtue she knew he had resisted the greatest temptations that ever man was tried with i hope poor woman that none of them were from her  for her own sake notwithstanding what dr bartlett once whispered and good man as he is i hope so  the chevalier she said was superior to all attempts that were not grounded on honor and conscience she had heard of women who had spread their snares for him in his early youth but women in her country of slight fame she said had no way to come at him and women of virtue were secure from his attempts yet would you not have thought asked she that beauty might have marked him for its own such an air such an address so much personal bravery accustomed to shine in the upper life all that a woman can value in a man is the chevalier grandison  she at last declared that she wished him to be mine rather than any womans on earth  i was very frank very unreserved she seemed delighted with me and wnt away professing to every one as well as to me that she admired me for my behavior my sincerity my prudence she was pleased to say and my artlessness above all the women she had ever conversed with  may her future conduct be such as may do credit to her birth to her high fortune to her sex and i shall then forgive her for an attempt as it was frustrated that i thought she ought never to be forgiven for and which made me as we sat often look upon her with terror and deprecation may i say  in answer to your kind enquiries about my health  i only say what must be will  sometimes better than at others if i could hear you were good i should be better i believe adieu my dear lady g adieu  letter vii miss byron in continuation or sir charless first letter from bologna vol iv letter xl p      wednesday may    several letters of miss byron lady g lady l and miss jervois which were written between the date of the preceding letter and the present are omitted  i am greatly obliged to you my dear lady g for dispatching to me in so extraordinary a way the first letter of your brother to dr bartlett i thank god for his safe arrival at the destined place and for the faint hopes given in it of his friends life the almighty will do his own work and in his own way and that must be best  you ask me for my opinion of the contents of this letter at large  what can i say  thus much i must say   i admire more and more your brother i pity the family he is gone to comfort and relieve and i pray for clementina and jeronymo and this as well for your brothers sake as theirs  he generously rejoices that he did not pursue his own inclinations  i am very happy in what he says of your harriet indeed my dear i am though we may be conscious of not deserving the praises bestowed upon us yet are we fond of standing high in the opinion of those we love two paragraphs i have got by heart i need not tell you which they are but alas his greatly favored friend is not so free as he hoped she was it is a pleasure to me however because it is such to him that it is not his fault but her own that she is not  the countess whom he so justly praises writes to me and i answer  but to what purpose i am afraid that a very important observation of his comes not in time to do me service since if my prudence is proportioned to my trials i ought to have endeavored to exert it sooner  but it seems there is an insuperable objection against the poor ladys going into a nunnery i never heard of that before it seems right to the marchioness that the young lady who is entitled to a great share of this worlds goods should not be dedicated to heaven this may be so in the family eye for aught i know but i am persuaded that if there is any one of it who would not have pleaded this obstacle to a divine dedication it would be clementina herself and yet i own i can allow of their regret that the cruel laurana should be a gainer by clementinas being lost as i may say to the world  your brothers kind remembrance of mr and mrs reeves is an honor done to me as well as to them i must take it so lady g and what he says of me in the paragraph in which he mentions emily adds to the pride he had raised in me before  dr bartlett is extremely obliging in not offering to with hold any passage in your brothers letters from us i have let him know that i think him so and have begged him not to spare anything out of tenderness to me on a supposition that i may be affected or made uneasy by what your brother shall write to him this is speaking very plainly my dear but it is to dr battlett and he signified to us more than once that he could not be a stranger to the heart of your harriet  and now my dear lady g let me ask you in my turn what you think of one passage in your brothers letter of which you have not taken the least notice in yours to me charlotte i hope is happy if she be not it must be her own fault  you have honestly owned in your last yet too roguishly for a true penitent that it was evidently so in the debate about being presented miss grandison used to like the drawing room well enough her brother has owned in my hearing as well as in yours that had he not been so long out of england and since his return to it so seldom in town he would have made it a part of his duty to pay his attendance there at proper times but lady g forsooth disdained to appear as the property reflect but my dear how absurd of a worthy man to whom she had vowed love honor and obedience  i should not remind you thus of past flippancies did not new ones seem to spring up every day  for heavens sake my dear lady g let it not be carried from england to italy that lord g is not so happy with a sister of sir charles grandison as might be expected left it be asked whether that sister and this brother had the same mother i have written before all that i could possibly say on this subject you know yourself to be wrong it would be impertinence to expostulate further on a duty so known and acknowleged no more therefore on this head authorize me to say for ever  as to my health  i would fain be well i am more sorry that i am not for the sake of my friends who are incessantly grieving for me than for my own i have not i think i have not anything to reproach myself with nor yet anybody to reproach me to whom have i given cause of triumph over me by my ill usage or insolence to him i yield to an event to which i ought to submit and to a woman not less but more worthy than myself and who has a prior claim  i long to hear of the meeting of this noble pair may it be propitious may sir charles grandison have the satisfaction and the merit with the family of being the means of restoring to reason a greater restoration than to health the woman every faculty of whose soul ought in that case to be devoted to god and to him methinks i have at present but one wish it is that i may live to see this lady if she is to be the happy woman could i do you think lady g if i were to have this honor cordially congratulate her as lady grandison heaven only knows but it would be my glory if i could for then i should not scruple to put myself in a rank with clementina and to demand her hand as that of my sister  but poor olivia  shall i not pity the unhappy woman who i am afraid is too shortsighted to look forward to that only consolation which can weaken the force of worldly disappointments  my cousin reeves in a joyful letter just now received acquaints me with the birth of the fine boy his wife has presented to him an event that exceedingly rejoices us all he tells me in it how good you are continue to them my dear lady g your affectionate regards they ever loved you even for your very faults so bewitchingly lively are you but i have told mr reeves that his partiality for you shows that he feels not for lord g as he would for himself were his wife a lady g  i will write to my other friends dear creature dont let me say that i love lord g better than i do lady g yet were the aggressor in a quarrel my own sister endeared to me by a thousand generous offices i would i must love the sufferer best at least while he is a sufferer witness  harriet byron  letter viii miss byron in continuation thursday june   thanks an hundred times repeated to you my dear lady g and to good dr bartlett for the favor of sir charless letters of may          and    n s all following so quick that which you favored me with of the  0th  st upon which i wrote to you yesterday i dispatch them to you for the doctor all together  i cannot my dear have much to say to the contents of these  the have met had more interviews than one  why cannot the count of belvedere  but no more of that i dont like this general the whole family the two noble sufferers jeronymo and clementina excepted seem to me to have more pride than gratitude  ay mother and all my dear  but you see sir charles has been indisposed no wonder visited by the marquis and marchioness you see not a slight illness therefore you may believe god preserve him and restore lady clementina and the worthy jeronymo  his kind remembrance of me  but my dear i think the doctor and you must forbear obliging me with any more of his letters  his goodness his tenderness his delicacy his strict honor but adds  yet can any new instances add to a character so uniformly good  but the chief reason of my selfdenial if you were to take me at my word as to these communications is that his affecting descriptions and narratives of lady clementinas resveries poor poor lady will break my heart yet you must send them to  your ever obliged harriet byron  letter ix lady g to miss byron monday june   my dear creature you must not you shall not be ill what signify your heroics child if they only give you placid looks and make an hypocrite of the sincerest girl in england in other words if they are only a cover for a despairing heart be better be less affected or i can tell you the doctor and i and lady l shall all think it but sght to take you at your first word and send you no more of my brothers letters yet we are all of us as greatly affected by the contents of them as our dear harriet can be i am sure you will allow us to be so for the poor lady but to subjects less interesting  the doctor is with us aunt nell is in love with him he ordered his matters and came to town at lady ls request and mine and beauchamps that we might the sooner come at my brothers letters  very obliging  beauchamp worships the good man he would have been with him at grandison hall but that sir harry and lady beauchamp knew not how to part with him and i fancy another flier reason withheld him half unknown to himself love is certainly creeping into his heart this emily a little rogue has already yet suspects it not made a conquest he deserves her better than any man i know she him had she not already a great hole in her heart through which one may run ones head but does not beauchamp love the same person as much as she can do and does he not know that the girl is innocent and the man virtuous even as i believe to chastity  dear harriet dont let the ladies around you nor the gentlemen neither hear this grace supposed to be my brothers nobody about us shall for me i would not have my brother made the jest of one sex and the aversion of the other and be thought so singular a young man  beauchamp says nothing to anybody of his regard to emily but he lays himself out in so many unaffected assiduities to her that one cannot but see it she likes his company and his conversation but why because he is always launching out in the praises of his and her beloved friend he says there is not he believes such another innocent and undesigning heart in the world except one in northamptonshire  there is for you harriet  so he praises not mine that is the wickedest thing of these felons of men poverty compels them though  poverty of genius  they cannot praise one woman but by robbing the rest different however from all men is my brother i will engage he could find attributes for fifty different women yet do justice to them all because though he sees every one with favor he is above flattering any  well but harriet i expected letters six times as long as these you sent me upon my word if you are so very heavenlyminded as you appear to be in the first for the second is hardly a letter i will have you to town and nun you up with aunt nell the doctor is one of the most pious men in england but she will tire him with praying and expounding as she calls it do you know that the good creature was a methodist in yorkshire these overdoers my dear are wicked wretches what do they but make religion look unlovely and put underdoers out of heart my brother is the man you know i must always bring in my brother though i am a little out of humor with him at present and am i not justified by the many since it is always the way of those who intend not to mend to set their hearts against their correctors  my brother professes not the one half of what he practices he uses the fashion without abusing it or himself by following it some such words in a sacred book rumble in my mad head but i know i have not them right  it is impossible say what you will harriet to be long upon terms with this man  lord g i mean he was once half in the right to be sure but you should not have reproached me with that the bride was shown the jewels were shown the whole family paraded it together and emily wrote you all howandabout it but never fear for your poor friend the honest man will put himself in the wrong next to save her credit he has been long careless and now he is at times imperious as well as careless very true nay it was but yesterday that he attempted to hum a tune of contempt upon my warbling an italian air an opera couple we is it not charming to sing at i cannot say to each other when we have a mind to be spiteful but he has a miserable voice he cannot sing so fine a song as i can he should not attempt it besides i can play to my song that cannot be such a foe to melody that he hates the very fight of my harpsichord he flies out of the room if i but move toward it  he has everybody of his side lord and lady l emily nay dr bartlett and aunt nell this sets him up no such thing as managing ones own husband when so many wise heads join together to uphold him utterly ruined for a husband is lord g i once bad some hopes of him but now every goodnatured jest is turned into earnest by these mediators and mediatrices  a few days ago in a fond fit i would have stroked his cheek though he was not in a very good humor neither  so then so then said i as i had seen beauchamp do an hour before by his prancing nag and it was construed as a contempt and his bristles got up upon it bless me thought i this man is not so sensible of a favor as beauchamps horse and yet i have known the time when he has thought it an honor to be admitted to press the same fair hand with his lips on one knee  hark he is now at this very instant complaining to aunt nell little do they think that i am in her closet she hears all he has to say with greedy ears  these antiquated souls are happy when they can find reasons from the disagreement of honest people in matrimony to make a virtue of necossity thank the lord i am not married if these be the fruits of matrimony  ah lord my dear now these last words have slipped me  the man  between you and me has been a villain to me can i forgive him could you in my circumstances yet i hope it is not so if it should and lady gertrude and aunt nell spiteful old souls should find their perpetual curiosity answered as they wish i will have my own will in everything  and how came i you will wonder in aunt nells closet i will tell you she had got my pen and ink and i went to fetch it myself the scribbling fit was strong upon me so i sat down in her closet to write and they both came into her chamber together to have their own talk  hark i say  they are really talking of me  complaining  abominable  this wicked aunt of mine i tell you nephew that you are too ready to make up with her  could you have believed this of ones own aunt no wonder that he is so refractory at times but hush  why dont he speak louder he cannot be in earnest hurt if he does not raise his voice creeping soul and whiner  i cannot hear a word he says i have enough against her  but i want something against him  duce take them both i cannot hear more than the sound of her brokentoothed voice mumbling and his plaintive humdrum whimpering i will go out in full majesty i will lighten upon them with airs imperial how the poor souls will start at my appearance how will their consciences fly in their faces the complainer and adviser both detected in the very fact as i may say and yet perhaps you harriet will think them less blameable than their consciencestriker  hem  three hems in anger  and now i burst upon them  o harriet what a triumph was mine  aunt neil who has naturally a good blowzing northcountry complexion turned as pale as ashes her chin nose and lips were all in motion my nimble lord gave a jump and three leaps to the other side of the room he had not the courage to look directly at me his face as sharp as a new moon in a frosty night and his sides so gaunt  as if he wanted to shrink into himself they could not in their hearts but accuse themselves of all they had said as if i had heard every word of it  while i what a charming thing is innocence half a foot tailer than usual stalked along between them casting a look of indignation upon aunt nell of haughtiness on lord g my withheld breath raised my complexion and swelled my features and when i got to the door i pulled it after me with an air that i hope made them both tremble  letter x lady g in continuation well my dear  aunt nell and i have made up i have been pacified by her apologies and promises never again to interfere between man and wife as i told the forlorn soul you maiden ladies though you have lived a great while in the world cannot know what strange creatures these husbands are and how many causes that cannot be mentioned by the poor wife to her friends a woman may have to be displeased with her man in order to keep the creature in some little decorum  indeed madam  there i stop  this excited her prudery and she made out the rest and perhaps a great deal more than the rest she looked down to show she was sensible tried for a blush and i verily believe had she been a young woman would have succeeded why truly niece i believe you are right these men are odious creatures  and then she shuddered as if she had said lord defend me from them  a prayer that being a good creature she need not doubt will be answered  but for lord g there lies no forgiveness to complain of his wife to her aunt a married man to submit matrimonial squabbles and every honest pair has some to others to an old maid especially and to authorize her to fit in judgment on his wifes little whimsies when the good woman wants to make herself important to him and thereby endeavor to destroy the wifes significance there is no bearing of that he had made lord l and lady l judges over me before nay this infant emily has taken her seat on the same bench and in her pretty manner has by beseeching me to be good supposed me bad and to some one of them who knows but to the telltale himself though he denies it my brothers hint is owing on which you so sagely expostulate my reputation therefore as an obedient wife with all those whose good opinion was worth courting is gone and is not this enough to make one careless  bless me my dear this man of errors has committed if possible a still worse fault he regards me not as anybody the earl and he have been long uneasy it seems that we live at the expense of my brother to whom there is no making returns and a house offering in grosvenorsquare he has actually contracted for it without consulting me i must own that i cannot in my heart disapprove either of the motive or the house as i have the latter described to me but his doing it of his own head is an insolent act of prerogative dont you in conscience think so does he not by this step make me his chattles a piece of furniture only to be removed as any other piece of furniture or picture or cabinet at his pleasure  he came to me  i hope madam in a reproaching accent i have done something now that will please you ought his stiff air and the reflecting word now to have gone unpunished have thou found out any other old maid to fit in judgment on the behavior of thy wife but what have thou done  i was astonished when the man told me  and who is to be thy housekeeper is this done in hope i will follow thee or do thou intend to exclude from thy habitation the poor woman who met thee at church a few weeks ago  just then came in lady l i asked her what she thought of this step  had she vindicated him i never would have regarded a word she said between us but she owned that she thought i should have been consulted and then he began to see that he had done a wrong thing i acquainted her with his former sault unatoned for as it was  why as to that she did not know what to say only that it became my character and good sense so to behave as that lord g should have no reason to complain of me to anybody a hard thing harriet to be reflected upon by an own sister  lady l prevailed upon me unknown to lord g to go with her to see this house it is a handsome house i have but the one aforesaid objection to it  but let me ask you again is not the slight he has put upon me in taking it without consulting me an inexcusable thing  i know you will say it is but i will tell you how i think to do  i will make him give up the contract and when he has done so unknown to him take the same house myself this will be returning the compliment his excuse is he was sure i should like the house and the terms if he is sure of my liking it and has chosen it himself the duce is in it if i may not be sure of his  would he dislike it because i liked it  say so if you dare harriet and suppose me blameable  o my dear what shall i do with this passionate man i could not you know forgive him for the two unatonedfor steps which he had taken without some contrition and do you think he would show any  not he  i said something that set him up something bordering upon the whimsical  no matter what he pranced upon it i with my usual meekness calmly rebuked him and then went to my harpsichord and what do you think how shall i tell it yet to you i may  why then he whisked his hat from under his arm he was going out and silenced broke demolished my poor harpsichord  i was surprised but instantly recovering myself you are a violent wretch lord g said i quite calmly how could you do so  suppose and i took the wicked hat i should throw it into the fire but i gave it to him and made him a fine courtesy there was command of temper i thought at the instant of epictetus and his snapt leg was i not as great a philosopher  he is gone out dinner is ready and no lord g aunt nell is upon the fret but she remembers her late act of delinquency so is obliged to be silent i have her under my thumb  the man came in after we had dined i went to him as if nothing had been the matter between us you look vexed my lord  it was a very violent action it vexed me at first but you see how soon i recovered my temper i wish you would learn patience of me but come i forgive you i will not be angry with you for an evil that a little money will repair i see you are vexed  so i am madam at my very soul but it is not   now to be helped  true my lord and i forgive you   but curse me if i forgive you madam   o fie that is wickedly said but i know you will when i ask you  aunt nell sat by the window her eyes half shut her mouth as firmly closed as if her lips were glewed together  madam addressing himself to her i shall set out tomorrow for windsor  windsor my lord said i  he answered me not  ask my good lord g madam said i in a sweet humble voice how long he shall stay at windsor  how long my lord mumbled out aunt nell   from windsor i shall go to oxford  ask him madam how long he shall be before he returns  how long my lord shall you be absent from us  when i find i can return and not be the jest of my own wife  i may perhaps  there he stopped and looked stately  tell my lord that he is too serious madam tell him that hardly any other man but would see i was at play with him and would play again  you hear what my niece says my lord  i regard nothing she says  ask him madam who is to be of his party  who my lord is to be of your party  nobody turning himself half round that he might not be thought to answer me but her  ask him madam whether it be business or pleasure that engages him to take this solitary tour  she looked the question to him  neither madam to her i left my pleasure some weeks ago at st georges church i have never found it since  a strange forgetful man and as ungrateful as forgetful and i stepped to him and looked in his face so courteously and with such a sweet smile  he sullenly turned from me and to aunt nell  ask my lord if he takes this journey thinking to oblige me  ask him your own questions niece  my lord will not answer me  he strutted and bit his lip with vexation  come i will try once more if you think me worth answering  i think my lord if you shall be gone a month or two i may take a little trip to northamptonshire emily shall go with me the girl is very uneasy to see miss byron and miss byron will rejoice to see us both a visit from us will do her good  he took it that i was not desirous of a short absence and he pouched his mouth and reared himself up and swelled but answered me not  see madam my lord is sullen he will not answer me i must get you to ask my questions i think it my duty to ask leave to go my lord may go where he pleases without my leave  very fit he should he is a man i once could have done so highho but i have vowed obedience and vassalage i will not break my vow ask him if i have his consent for a visit to miss byron of a month or two ask him madam if he can make himself happy in my absence i should otherwise be loath to go for so long a time  i should be as welcome said he to miss byron as her   as her as she you should say i believe if you will not say as you madam and bow to me  i believe so my lord miss byron would rejoice to see any of my friends miss byron is very good  would to god   that somebody were half as good interrupted i somebody understands you my lord and wishes so too  pray madam ask my lord if i may go  his new house will be putting in order mean time   i will ask none of your questions for you  new house niece you harp too much on one string  i mean not offense i have done with that subject my lord to be sure has dominion over his bird he can choose her cage she has nothing to do but sit and sing in it  when her instrument is mended and in tune  he has but one fault he is too goodnatured to his bird but would he take your advice madam   now though this may sound to you harriet a little recriminating yet i do assure you i spoke it in a very sweet accent yet up got aunt nell in a passion my lord too was all alive i put myself between her and the door and throwing my arms about her you shall not go madam  smiling sweetly in her glowing face upon my honor you shall not  wicked trifler she called me as i led her to a chair perverse girl and two or three other names  apropos enough my character is not difficult to hit that is the beauty of it  my lord withdrew in wrath and then the old lady said she would now tell me a piece of her mind and she made me sit down by her and thus she addressed me  niece it is my opinion that you might be if you would one of the happiest women in the world  you dont hear me complain madam  well if lord g did complain to me it was to me and you should be sorry for the occasion and not for the complaint  i may be sorry for both madam  well but lord g is one of the bestnatured men in the world   the mans well enough passionate men they say are goodnatured  why will not you be happy niece  i will i am not now unhappy  more shame for you then that you will not make lord g happy  he is captious i am playful that is all  what do you think your brother would say   he would blame me as you do  dear creature be good dear creature make lord g happy  i am like a builder madam i am digging for a foundation there is a good deal of rubbishy humors to remove a little swampiness of soil and i am only removing it and digging deeper to make my foundation sure  take care take care niece you may dig too deep there may be springs you may open and never be able to stop them till they have sapped your foundation take care niece  thank you madam for your caution pity you had not been a builder yourself  had such a fellow laborer as lord g offered i should not have refused a partnership with him i do assure you  fairly answered aunt nell thought i i was pleased with her  dont you think lord g loves you dearly  as to dearly i cannot say but i believe he loves me as well as most husbands love their wives  are you not ungrateful then  no i am only at play with him i dont hate him  hate him dreadful if you did but he thinks you despise him  that is one of the rubbishy notions i want to remove he would have it that i did when he could have helped himself but he injures me now if he thinks so i cannot say i have a very profound reverence for him he and my brother should not have been allied but had i despised him in my heart i should have thought myself a very bad creature for going to church with him  that is well said i love you now your brother is indeed enough to put all other men down with one but may i tell lord g that you love him  no madam  no i am sorry for that  let him find it out but he ought to know so much of human nature and of my sincerity as to gather from my behavior to him that had i either hated or despised him i would not have been his and it would have been impossible for me to be so playful with him to be so domestic and he so much at home with me am i fond of seeking occasions to carry myself from him what delights what diversions what public entertainments do i hunt after  none is not he are not all my friends sure of finding me at home whenever they visit me  so far so good said aunt eleanor  i will open my heart to you madam you are my fathers sister you have a right to my sincerity but you must keep my secret  proceed my dear  i know my own heart madam if i thought i could not trust it and i wish lord g had a good opinion of it i would not dance thus as you suppose on the edge of danger  good creature  i shall call you good creature byandby let me call lord g to us  i was silent i contradicted her not she rang she bid the servant tell lord g that she desired his company lord g was pranced out she regretted i was not glad that he was  i will tell you what my dear said she i have heard it suggested by a friend of yours that you would much rather have had mr beauchamp   not a word more of such a suggestion madam i should hate myself were i capable of treating lord g meanly or contemptibly with a thought of preference to any man breathing now i am his i have a great opinion of mr beauchamp he deserves it but i never had the shadow of a wish that i had been his i never should have spoken of my brothers excellencies as outshining those of lord g had he not been my brother and therefore could not be more to me and had they not been so conspicuous that no other man could be disgraced by giving place to him no madam let me assure you once for all that i am so far from despising my lord g that were any misfortune to befall him i should be a miserable woman  she embraced me why then   i know your inference madam it is a just one i am afraid i think as well of my own understanding as i do of lord gs i love to jest to play to make him look about him i dislike not even his petulance you see i bear all the flings and throws and peevishness which he returns to my sauciness i think i ought his complaints of me to you to lord and lady l which bring upon me their and your grave lecturings and even anger i can forgive him for and this i show by making those complaints matter of pleasantry rather than resentment i know he intended well in taking the house though he consulted me not first it was surely wrong in him yet i am not mortally offended with him for it his violence to my poor harpsichord startled me but i recollected myself and had he buffetted me instead of that as i was afraid he would i should have thought i ought to have borne it whether i could or not and to have returned him his hat with a courtesy believe me madam i am not a bad i am only a whimsical creature i tried my brother once i set him up i was afraid of him indeed but i tried him again then he called it constitution and laughed at me and run me out of breath in my own way so i let him alone lord l lady l had it in turn lord g has a little more than his turn perhaps and why because he is for ever fitting the cap to his head and because i dont love him less than those i am less free with come madam let me demand your kind thoughts i will deserve them contradiction and opposition mediators and mediatrices have carried my playfulness further than it would otherwise have gone but henceforth your precepts my brothers and miss byrons shall not want their weight with me whether i may show it or not at this instant my reign i am afraid will be but short let the man bear with me a little nowandthen i am not absolutely ungenerous if he can but show his love by his forbearance i will endeavor to reward his forbearance with my love  she embraced me and said that now she attributed to the gaiety of my spirits and not to perverseness my tillnow unaccountable behavior i was sure said she that you were more your mothers than your fathers daughter let me when my lord comes in see an instance of the behavior you bid me hope for  i will try said i what can be done  we parted i went up to my pen and scribbled down to this place  this moment my lord is come in into my brothers study is he directly gone not a question asked about me sullen i warrant he used to pay his duty to me and ask blessing the moment he came in if admissible is that a word harriet but times are altered ah harriet when i know i am saucy i can bear negligence and slight but when i intend to be good knowing my own heart to be right i shall be quite saucy if he is sullen is not the duty of wedded people reciprocal  aunt eleanor and he are talking together she is endeavoring i suppose to make a philosopher of him promise nothing for me aunt nell i will have the whole merit of my own reformation  letter xi lady g in continuation prepare harriet to hear strange and wonderful things  my lord sent up his compliments and desired to know if he might attend me i was in my dressingroom he was not always so polite i wish thought i since displeasure produces respect that familiarity does not spoil this man but i will try him  i shall be glad to see my lord was the answer i returned  up he came one leg dragged after the other not alert as he used to be on admission to his charlotte the last eight stairs his steps founded i go up with an heavy heart he entered bowed were the words yours you should be glad to see me madam  they were my lord  would to god you said truth  i did i am glad to see you i wanted to talk with you  about this northamptonshire visit  are you in earnest madam to make that visit  i am miss byron is not well emily pines to see her as much as i you have no objection  he was silent  do you set out tomorrow sir for windsor and oxford  he sighed i think so madam  shall you visit lord w  i shall  and complain to him of me my lord  he shook his grave head as if there were wisdom in it  be quiet harriet  not good all at once  that would not be to hold it  no madam i have done complaining to anybody you will one day see you have not acted generously by the man who loves you as his own soul  this and his eyes glistening moved me  have we not been both wrong my lord  perhaps we have madam but here is the difference  i have been wrong with a right intention you have been wrong and studied to be so  prettily said  repeat it my lord  how was it and i took his hand and looked very graciously  i cannot bear these airs of contempt  if you call them so you are wrong my lord though perhaps intending to be right  he did not see how good i was disposed to be as i said a change all at once would have been unnatural  very well madam and turned from me with an air halfgrieved halfangry  only answer me my lord are you willing i should go to northamptonshire  if you choose to go i have no objection miss byron is an angel  now dont be perverse lord g dont praise miss byron at the expense of somebody else  would to heaven madam   i wish so too  and i put my hand before his mouth  so kindly  he held it there with both his and kissed it i was not offended but do you actually set out for windsor and oxford tomorrow my lord  not madam if you have any commands for me  why now that is well said has your lordship anything to propose to me  i could not be so welcome as your escorte as i am sure i should be to miss byron and her friends as her guest  you could not how can you say so my lord you would do me both honor and pleasure  what would i give that you mean what you say  i do mean it my lord  my hand upon it  i held out my hand for his he snatched it and i thought would have devoured it  we will take the coach my lord that i may have your company all the way  you equally astonish and delight me madam is it possible that you are   yes yes dont in policy make it such a wonder that i am disposed to be what i ought to be  i shall be too too too happy sobbed the man  no no i will take care of that married folks brought up differently of different humors inclinations and soforth never can be too happy now i intend to put up all our little quarrels in my workbag you know i am a worker not quite so bad at worst as some modern wives there they shall lie till we get to miss byrons  i revere the character of mrs shirley my harriets grandmother mrs selby you have seen harriet and you and i and the two sages i have named will get together in some happy hour then i will open my workbag and take out our quarrels one by one and lay them on the table before us and we will be determined by their judgments  my dear lady g if you think there is anything amiss in your behavior to me or in mine to you let us spread the faults on your toilette now and we shall go down to northamptonshire all love and harmony and delight those excellent   always prescribing my lord  o these men  why will you not let me have my own way  have not all these good folks heard of our folly and shall they not be witnesses of our wisdom if they are not at the agreement they will wonder how it came about  i tell you sir that they shall have an opportunity to laugh at us both at me for my flippancy at you for your petulance i will be sorry you shall be ashamed that quarrels so easily made up and where the heart of either is not bad should subsist a quarter of an hour and be perpetually renewing i will have my own way i tell you  dont make me look like a fool madam before such ladies as those if we do visit them  i must have my jest my lord you know for have you not tried it that i can have patience  let me see  is that the hat that you pulled off with an air so lately  pish how your countenance falls i am not angry with you but dont do so again if you can help it  i must have my jest i say but assure yourself of the first place in my heart  what more would the man have  o madam nothing nothing more and he kissed my hand on one knee with a rapture that he never could have known had we always been quiet easy and drowsy like some married folks whom the world calls happy  but then the man came out with his gewgaw japanchina taste why why is it the privilege of people of quality now to be educated in such a way that their time can hardly ever be worthily filled up and as if it were a disgrace to be either manly or useful he began to talk of equipage and such nonsense but i cut him short by telling him that i must have my whole way on this occasion  our visit is to be a private one said i we will have only the coach jenny shall attend on emily and me no other female servant two men we will have no more i will not have so much as your frenchhorn we go to the land of harmony kings sometimes travel incog we will ape kings when they put off royalty will not this thought gratify your pride  you my lord have some foibles to be cured of as well as i  we shall be wonderfully amended both of us by this excursion  poor man his heart was as light as a feather upon my word my dear i begin to think that if my lord and master had been a wise man i should not have known what to do with him yet i will not forgive any one but myself who finds him out to be otherwise  he told me in raptures of joy that i should direct everything as i pleased god grant that i might not change my mind as to the visit he hoped i was in earnest and looked nowandthen at me as if he questioned it  but what do you think the man did he retired came back presently called me his dearest life and said that it was possible i might want to have an opportunity given me to make some presents or to furnish myself with trinkets of one nature or other against i set out and he should be very sorry if by his inattention i were obliged to ask him for the means to show the natural liberality of my spirit in the way i thought best to exert it and then he begged me to accept of that note putting into my hand a bank note of  00 l  i stepped to my closet and as instantly returned this my lord said i is a most cruel reflection upon me it looks as if i were to be bribed to do my duty  there my lord take back your present i will endeavor to be good without it  and as a proof that i will you must not only receive back your favor though i look upon it as such and from my heart thank you for it but take as your right this note which lord w presented to me on the day you received me as yours  he held back both hands gratefully reluctant  you must you shall take both notes my lord i only wanted a fit opportunity to put lord ws note into your hands before it was owing to my flippant folly and not to your want of affection that i had not that opportunity sooner bear with me nowandthen if i should be silly again complain of me only to myself my heart i reassure you is yours and yours only i was not willing that you should owe to any other persons interposition my declarations of affection and regard to you not even to miss byron though i talked of my workbag whom i love as my own sister  the worthy man was in ecstacies he could not express in words the joy of his heart he kneeled and wrapped his arms about my waist and sobbed his request to me to forgive his petulance and the offenses he had ever given me by any acts of passion or words of anger  you have not offended me my lord forgive my past follies and my future failures when you were most angry i wondered at your patience had i been you i should not have borne what you bore with me  for gods sake madam take back both notes we can have but one interest you will make me easier when i know that you have power in your hands to gratify every wish of your heart  you must you shall my lord take these notes i will apply to you whenever i have occasion and receive your favors as such i wish not to be independent of you i have a handsome sum by me the moiety of the money that was my mothers which my brother divided between my sister and me when he first came over is not the settlement made upon me more than my brother asked or thought i should expect did he not oppose so large an annuity for pinmoney as your father lady gertrude and you would have me accept of because he thought that such a large allowance might make a wife independent of her husband and put it out of his power with discretion to oblige her my brother in an instance glorious to him said that he would not be a richer man than he ought to be in such instances i will be his sister  aunt nell joined us my lord in transports told her what had passed the good old soul took the merit of the reformation to herself she wept over us she rejoiced to hear of our intended journey to northamptonshire my lord proposed to have the house he had taken fitted up to my liking while we were away at his desire i promised to see it in his company and give my opinion of his designed alterations but as i know he has judgment in nickknackatories and even as much as i wish him in what is called taste i intend to compliment him with leaving all to him and resolve to be satisfied with whatever he does  and now is the good man so busy so pleased so important bless me my dear who would rob the honest man of any part of his merit or even divide it with him  and what harriet do you say to me now  in a weeks time i shall be with you be sure be cheerful and well or i shall be ready to question my welcome  this moment having let dr bartlett into our intended visit he has offered to accompany us now shall we i know be doubly welcome the doctor emily my lord g and your charlotte will be happy in one coach the doctor is prodigiously pleased with me what is the text more joy in heaven over one sinner that repents than over ninetyandnine just persons who need it not  i long to see you and every one of the family so deservedly dear to you god give you health and us no worse news from italy than we have yet had and how happy shall we be  lord and lady l wish they could be of the party they are in love with me now emily says she dotes upon me i begin to think that there is almost as much pleasure in being good as in teazing yet a little roguery rises nowandthen in the heart of  your charlotte g june   the doctor has been so good i believe because i am good as to allow me to take a copy of a letter of my brothers to that wretch everard but for your perusal only i enclose it therefore under that restriction let it speak its own praises  we are actually preparing to be your guests you will only have time to forbid us if we shall not be welcome  merciful what a packet    letter xii sir charles grandison to mr grandison bologna june   n s what can i do for my cousin why would he oppress me with so circumstantial an account of the heavy evil that has befallen him and not point out a way by which i could comfort or relieve him dont be afraid of what you call the severity of my virtue i should be ready to question the rectitude of my own heart if on examination i had not reason to hope that charity is the principal of those virtues which you attribute to me you recriminate enough upon yourself in what way i can extricate or assist you is now my only question  you ask my advice in relation to the payment of the debts which the world call debts of honor and for which you have asked and are granted three months time have you not sir strengthened your engagement by your request and have not they entitled themselves to the performance by their compliance with it the obligation which rashness and perhaps surprise laid you under your deliberation has confirmed  you say that your new creditors are men of the town sharpers and gamesters but my cousin how came you among such they came not to you i say not this to upbraid you but i must not have you deceive yourself who but a mans self is to suffer by his rashness or inconsideration they are reputed to have been possessed of fortunes however they came by them which would have enabled them to answer the stakes they played for had they been the losers and would you not have exacted payment from them had you been the winner did you at the time suspect loaded dice or foul play you are not sir a novice in the ways of the town if you had good proof of what from the ill success you seem only to suspect i should not account the debts incurred debts of honor and should hardly scruple had i not indirectly promised payment by asking time for it or had they refused to give it to call in to my aid the laws of my country and the rather as the appeal to those laws would be a security to me against ever again being seen in such company  adversity is the trial of principle without it a man hardly knows whether he is an honest man two things my cousin in his present difficulties must guard against the one that he do not suffer himself to be prevailed upon in hopes to retrieve his losses to frequent the tables by which he has suffered and so become one of the very men he has so much reason to wish he had avoided who would not rather be the sufferer than the defrauder what must be the nature of that man who having himself been ruined will endeavor to draw in other innocent men to their ruin  the other that he do not permit prior and worthier creditors creditors from valuable considerations to suffer by the distresses in which he has involved himself  it is a hard decision but were i my cousin i would divest myself of my whole estate were it necessary for the satisfaction of my creditors and leave it to their generosity to allow me what pittance they pleased for subsistence and within that pittance would i live not only for justice sake but were my difficulties owing to my own inconsideration as a just punishment for not being satisfied with my own ampler fortune and for putting to hazard a certainty in hopes of obtaining a share in the property of others excuse me my dear everard i mean not particular reflection but only to give you my notion of general justice in cases of this nature  acquit yourself worthily of these difficulties i consider you as my brother and you shall be welcome to take with me a brothers part of my estate till you can be restored to a competency  but with regard to the woman whom the infamous lord b would impose upon you as a wife that is an imposition to which you must not submit had she been the poorest honest girl in britain and you had seduced her by promises of marriage i must have made it the condition of our continued friendship that you had married her but a keptwoman  let not her let not the bad man have such a triumph i know his character well i know his dependence on the skill of his arm and i know his litigious spirit and the use he is capable of making of his privilege but regard not these let me advise you sir after you have secured to your creditors the payment of their just debts to come over to me the sooner the better by this means you will be out of the way of being disturbed by the menaces of this lord and the machinations of this woman we will return together i will make your case my own both the courage and the quality of the man who can be unjust are to be despised is not lord b an unjust man in every article of his dealings with men do not you my dear cousin be so in anyone and you will ever command the true fraternal love of  your charles grandison  letter xiii lady g to lady l selbyhouse friday june    here we are my caroline and the happiest people in the world should we be if harriet were but well my brother in england and you and lord l with us  mrs selby lucy nancy harriet met us at stonystratford escorted by uncle selby and his kinsman james  my lord and i were dear love and life all the journey i was the sweetesttempered creature  joyful people are not always wise ones when the heart is open silly things will be said anything in short that comes uppermost i kindly allowed for my lords joy on twenty occasions i smiled when he smiled laughedout when he laughed out did not talk to anybody else when he directed his discourse to me so that the honest man crowed all the way it is a charming thing thought i several times to be on a foot of good understanding with each other for now i can call him honest man or any names that lately would have made him prance and caper and he takes everything kindly nay two or three times he called me honest woman but laughed and looked round him at the time as if he were conscious that he had made a bold as well as witty retort  let me tell you lady l that i intend to give him signs when he exceeds and other signs when he is right and clever and i will accept of signs from him that he may not be affronted i am confident that we shall be in time an amazing happy couple  emily was rejoiced to see her equally beloved and revered miss byron miss byron embraced emily with the affection of a sister my honest man kissed miss byrons hand on one knee in the fervor of his love and gratitude for i had let him know that he owed much of his present happiness to her she congratulated him whisperingly in my hearing on my being good  james selby almost wept for love over emilys hand while emily looked as sleek and as shy as a bird newcaught for fear of being thought to give him encouragement after what you may remember passed between them at dunstable  aunt selby lucy nancy were all rapture to see us we to see them we were mother and sisters the moment we were seated uncle selby began to crack his jokes upon me in the first halfhour i spared him not and lord g will fare the better for him since i must have somebody to play the rogue with dr bartlett was the revered of every heart by the way i am in high credit with that good man for my behavior to my lord  miss byron received him with open arms and even as her father with an offered cheek and the modest man was so much affected by her filial regard for him that i was obliged for our own sakes to whisper her to reinin her joy to see him that we might have the pleasure of hearing him talk  when we arrived at selbyhouse our joy was renewed as if we had not seen each other at stratford  o i should have told you that in our journey from stratford hither aunt selby harriet emily and i were in one coach and i had as we went on a great deal of good instruction insinuated to me by way of felicitation on my being so very kind and obliging to lord g and as if i had been a child corrected for being untoward they endeavored to coax me into a perseverance in what they called my duty aunt selby on this occasion performed the maternal part with so much good sense and her praise and her cautions were so delicately insinuated that i began to think it was almost as pretty to be good as to be saucy  upon the whole i really believe lord g will have reason to rejoice as long as he lives that he was ruled by his wife in changing his windsor and oxford journey for this of northamptonshire so right a thing is it for men to be governable and perhaps you will add for women to keep good company  lord l thinks you my sage sister so good already that you need not be better or i would wish him to send you down to selbyhouse  well may harriet revere her grandmother that venerable woman is good in every sense of the word she is pious charitable benevolent affectionate condescending to the very foibles of youth cheerful wise patient under the infirmities of age having outlived all her wishes but one which is to see her harriet happily married and then she says she hopes to be soon released never could she be so much admired in her blooming youth though she was then it seems deservedly celebrated both for her mind and person as she is now in her declining age  you have seen and admire mrs selby she rises upon me every hour it gives ones heart joy lady l to look forward beyond the age of youth and flutter when we see by these ladies that women in their advanced years may to express myself in the style of sir rowland meredith be good for something or still better that the matronly time of female life is by far the most estimable of all the stages of it if they make good wives good mistresses and good mothers and let me say good aunts were it but to keep in countenance aunt gertrude and aunt nell who good souls will now hardly ever be mothers  lucy is an excellent young creature nancy when lucy is not present is as excellent her cousins kitty and patty holles are agreeable young women  james selby is a good sort of blundering wellmeaning great boy who when he has lived a few years longer may make much such a good sort of man as my lord g there is for you my once catechizing sister pray be as ready to praise as you used to be to blame me i find duty and love growing fast upon me i shall get into a custom of bringing in lord g on every occasion that will do him credit and then i shall be like lady betty clemson who is so perpetually dinning the ears of her guests with her domestic superlatives that we are apt to suspect the truth of all she says  but harriet our dear harriet is not at all well she visibly falls away and her fine complexion fades mr deane was here a week ago and lucy tells me was so much startled at the alteration in her lovely countenance that he broke from her and shed tears to lucy this good girl and nancy lament to each other the toovisible change but when they are with the rest of the family they all seem afraid to take notice of it to one another she herself takes generous pains to be lively cheerful and unapprehensive for fear of giving concern to her grandmother and aunt who will sometimes sit and contemplate the alteration sigh and nowandthen drop a silent tear which however they endeavor to smile off to avoid notice i have already observed that as these good ladies sit in her company they watch in silent love every turn of her mild and patient eye every change of her charming countenance for they too well know to what to impute the inward malady which has approached the best of hearts and they know that the cure cannot be within the art of the physician they as we do admire her voice and her playing they ask her for a song for a lesson on her harpsichord she plays she sings at the very first word in no one act of cheerfulness does she refuse to join her grandmother and her aunt selby frequently give a private ball the old lady delights to see young people cheerful and happy she is always present and directs the diversion for she has a fine taste we are often to have these balls for our entertainment miss byron her cousins say knowing the delight her grandmother takes in these amusements for the sake of the young people to whom she considers it as a healthful exercise as well as diversion is one of the alertest in them she excuses not herself nor encourages that supeinness that creeps on and invades a heart ill at ease yet everyone sees that solitude and retirement are her choice though she is very careful to have it supposed otherwise and on the first summons hastens into company and joins in the conversation o she is a lovely and beloved young creature i think verily that though she was the admiration of everybody when she was with us yet she is if possible more amiable at home and among her own relations her uncle selby raillies her sometimes but respect as well as love are visible in his countenance when he does in her returns sweetness and reverence are mingled she never forgets that the raillier is her uncle yet her delicacy is not more apparent than that she is mistress of fine talents in that way but often restrains them because she has far more superior ones to value herself upon and is not this the case with my brother also  not so i am afraid with your charlotte  all her friends however rejoice in our visit to them for her sake they compliment me on my lively turn and hope for a happy effect on miss byron from it  i cannot accuse her of reserve to me she owns her love for our brother as frankly as she used to do after we had torn the secret from her bosom at colnebrooke she acknowleges to me that she glories in it and will not try to conquer it because she is sure the trial will be to no purpose an excuse by the way that if the conquest be necessary would better become the mouth of your charlotte than that of our harriet and so i have told her  she prays for the restoration of lady clementina and recovery of signor jeronymo she loves to talk of the whole italian family and yet seems fully assured that clementina will be the happy woman but surely harriet must be our sister she values herself upon my brothers so solemnly requesting and claiming her friendship true friendship she but this morning argued with me being disinterested and more intellectual than personal is nobler than love love she said does not always ripen into friendship as is too frequently seen in wedlock  but does not the dear creature refine too much when she argues thus a calm and easy kind of esteem is all i have to judge from in my matrimony i know not what love is at the very highest and when i was most a fool my motive was supposed convenience in order to be freed from the apprehended tyranny of a father and that never carried me beyond liking but you lady l were an adept in the passion pray tell me if there be a difference between love and friendship which is the noblest upon my opposing you and lord l so truly one mind to her argument she said that yours is love mellowed into friendship upon full proof of the merit of each but that there was a time that the flame was love only founded in hope of the merit and the proof might have been wanting as it often is when the hope has been as strong and seemingly as well founded as in your courtship  harriet possibly may argue from her own situation in order to make her heart easy and my brother is so unquestionably worthy that love and friendship my be one thing in the bosom of a woman admiring him since he will not enter into any obligation that he cannot that he will not religiously perform and if this refinement will make her heart easier and enable her to allow his love to be placed elsewhere because of a prior claim and of circumstances that call for generous compassion while she can content herself with the offered friendship i think we ought to indulge her in her delicate notions  selbyhouse is a large convenient wellfurnishd habitation tomorrow we are to make a visit with lucy and nancy to their branch of the selby family james is gone before those two girls are orphans but their grandmother by their mothers side a good old lady motherinlaw to mr selby lives with them or rather they with her and loves them  on our return we are to have our first private ball at shirleymanor a fine old seat which already the benevolent owner calls her harriets with an estate of about  00 l a year round it  adieu my dear lady l  my lord and you i hope will own me now yet are you not sometimes surprised at the suddenness of my reformation shall i tell you how it came about to own the truth i began to find the man could be stout charlotte thought i what are you about you mean not to continue for ever your playful folly you have no malice no wickedness in your sauciness only a little levity it may grow into habit  make your retreat while you can with honor before you harden the mans heart and find your reformation a matter of indifference to him you have a few good qualities are not a modern woman have neither wings to your shoulders nor gadfly in your cap you love home at present the honest man loves you he has no vices every one loves you but all your friends are busy upon your conduct you will estrange them from you the man will not be a king log  be you a prudent frog lest you turn him into a stork a weak man if you suppose him weak made a tyrant will be an insupportable thing i shall make him appear weak in the eyes of everybody else when i have so much grace left as would make me rise against any one who should let me know they thought him so my brother will be reflected upon for his solicitude to carry me to church with a man whom i shall make the world think i despise harriet will renounce me my wit will be thought folly does not the suckling emily does not the stale virgin aunt eleanor think they have a right to blame entreat instruct me i will be good of choice and make my duty received as a favor i have traveled a great way in the road of perverseness i see briars thorns and a pathless track before me i may be benighted the day is far gone serpents may be in the brakes i will get home as fast as i can and rejoice every one who now only wonder what is become of me  these lady l were some of my reasonings make your advantage of them against me if you can you see that your grave wisdom had some weight with my light folly allow a little for constitution nowandthen and you shall not have cause to be ashamed of your sister  let me conclude this subject half one way half the other  that is to say half serious half roguish if my lord would but be cured of his taste for trifles and nickknacks i should possibly be induced to consider him as a man of better understanding than i once thought him but who can forbear sometimes to think slightly of a man who by effeminacies and a shell and china taste undervalues himself i hope i shall cure him of these foibles and if i can i shall consider him as a work of my own hands and be proud of him in compliment to myself  let my aunt eleanor no more nell if i can help it know how good i continue to be and now i will relieve you and myself with the assurance that i am and ever will be notwithstanding yours and lord ls past severity to me  your truly affectionate sister chapter g  letter xiv lady g to lady l selbyhouse monday july    several letters written in the space between the last date june    and the present which give an account of their diversions visits entertainments at selbyhouse shirleymanor etc are omitted  lord bless me my dear what shall we do my brother in all probability may by this time  but i cannot cannot tell how to suppose it  ah the poor harriet the three letters from my brother which by the permission of dr bartlett i enclose will show you that the italian affair is now at a crisis  read them in this place and return them sealed up and directed for the doctor  letter xv sir charles grandison to dr bartlett florence wednesday july     three weeks have now past since the date of my last letter to my paternal friend nor has it in the main been a disagreeable space of time since within it i have had the pleasure of hearing from you and other of my friends in england from those at paris and good news from bologna wherever i moved as well from the bishop and father marescotti as from mr lowther  the bishop particularly tells me that they ascribe to the amendment of the brother the hopes they now have of the sisters recovery  i passed near a fortnight of this time at naples and portici the general and his lady who is one of the best of women made it equally their study to oblige and amuse me  the general on my first arrival at naples entered into talk with me on my expectations with regard to his sister i answered him as i had done his mother and he was satisfied with what i said  when we parted he embraced me as his brother and friend and apologized for the animosity he once had to me if it pleased god to restore his sister no more from him he said should her mind be endangered but her choice should determine him his lady declared her esteem for me without reserve and said that next to the recovery of clementina and jeronymo her wish was to be entitled to call me brother  what my dear dr bartlett is at last to be my destiny the greatest opposer of the alliance once in view is overcome but the bishop you will observe by what i have told you ascribes to another cause the merit which the general gives me with a view possibly to abate my expectation be the event as it may i will go on in the course i am in and leave to providence the issue  mrs beaumont returned from bologna but yesterday  she confirms the favorable account i had before received of the great alteration for the better that there is in the health both of brother and sister and because of that in the whole family mr lowther she says is as highly as deservedly caressed by every one jeronymo is able to sit up two hours in a day he has tried his pen and finds it will be again in his power to give his friends pleasure with it  mrs beaumont tells me that clementina generally twice a day visits her beloved jeronymo she has taken once more to her needleworks and often fits and works in her brothers room this amuses her and delights him  she converses generally without much rambling and seems to be very soon sensible of her misfortune when she begins to talk incoherently for at such times she immediately stops not seldom sheds a tear and either withdraws to her own closet or is silent  she several times directed her discourse to mr lowther when she met him in her brothers chamber she observed great delicacy when she spoke of me to him and dwelt not on the subject but was very inquisitive about england and the customs and manners of the people particularly of the women  everybody has made it a rule jeronymo among the rest and to which also camilla strictly conforms never to lead her to talk of me she however asks often after me and numbers the days of my absence  at one time seeking mrs beaumont in her dressingroom she thus accosted her i come madam to ask you why everybody forbears to mention the chevalier grandison and when i do talks of somebody or something else camilla is as perverse in this way as any body nay jeronymo i have tried him several times does the very same can jeronymo be ungrateful can jeronymo be indifferent to his friend who had done so much for him i hope i am not looked upon as a silly or as a forward creature that am not to be trusted with hearing the name of the man mentioned for whom i profess an high esteem and gratitude tell me madam have i at any time in my unhappy hours behaved or spoken aught unworthy of my character of my family of the modesty of woman  if i have my heart renounces the guilt i must indeed have been unhappy i could not be clementina della porretta  mrs beaumont set her heart at ease on this subject  well said she it shall be seen i hope so that true modesty and high gratitude may properly have a place together in this heart putting her hand to her bosom let me but own that i esteem him for i really do and i hope my sincerity shall never mislead or betray me into indecorum and now madam let us talk of him for one quarter of an hour and no more here is my watch it is an english watch nobody knows that i bought it for that very reason dont you tell she then suspecting her head dropped a tear and withdrew in silence  mrs beaumont my dear friend knows the true state of my heart and she pities me she wishes that the ladys reason may be established she is afraid it should be risqued by opposition but there is a man whom she wishes to be clementinas there is a woman  but  do thou providence direct us both all that thou orderest must be best  mrs beaumont thinks lady clementina is at times too solemn and is the more apprehensive when she is so as there is a greatness in her solemnity which she is afraid will be too much for her she has often her silent fits in which she is regardless of what anybody but her mother says to her  as she grows better the fervor of her devotion which in her highest delirium never went quite off increases nor do they discourage but indulge her in it because in her it seems by the cheerfulness with which her ardent zeal is attended to be owing to true piety which they justly observe never makes a good mind sour morose or melancholy  mrs beaumont says that for two days before she came away she had shown on several occasions that she began to expect my return  she brok silence in one of her dumb fits  twenty days did he say camilla and was silent again  the day before mrs beaumont set out as she the young lady and marchioness were sitting at work together camilla entered with unusual precipitation with a message from the bishop desiring leave to attend them  and the marchioness saying by all means pray let him come in the young lady on hearing him approach laid down her work changed color and stood up with an air of dignity but on the bishops entrance sat down with a look of dissatisfaction as if disappointed  adieu my dear friend i shall reach bologna i hope tomorrow night you will soon have another letter from  your trulyaffectionate grandison  letter xvi sir charles grandison in continuation bologna july     it was late last night before i arrived at this place i sent my compliments to the family in the morning i went to their palace and was immediately conducted to the chamber of signor jeronymo he was disposing himself to rise that he might receive me up in order to rejoice me on his ability to do so i sat down by him and received the overflowings of his grateful heart everybody he told me was amended both in health and spirits  camilla came in soon after congratulating me on my arrival in the name of her young lady she let me know that in less than a quarter of an hour she would be ready to receive my visit  o sir said the good woman miracles miracles  we are all joy and hope  at going out she whispered as she passed i was then at the window my young lady is dressing in colors to receive you she will no more appear to you she says in black  now sir will you soon reap the reward of all your goodness for the general has signified to my lord his entire acquiescence with his sisters choice and their determination  the bishop came in chevalier said he you are welcome thrice welcome to bologna you have subdued us all clementina commands her own destiny the man whom she chooses to call hers be he who he will will have a treasure in her in every sense of the word the marquis the count father marescotti all severally made me the highest compliments the count particularly taking my hand said from us chevalier nothing will be wanting to make you happy from you there can be but one thing wanting to make us so  the marchioness entering saved me any other return than by bowing to each before i could speak to her welcome chevalier said she but you are not come before you were wished for you will find we have kept a more exact account of the days of your absence than we did before i hope her joy to see you will not be too much for her clementina ever had a grateful heart  the chevaliers prudence said father marescotti may be confided in he knows how to moderate his own joy on his first address to her on seeing her so greatly amended and then lady clementinas natural delicacy will not not have an example to carry her joy above her reason  the chevalier madam said the bishop smiling will at this rate be too secure we leave him not room for professions but he cannot be ungenerous  the chevalier grandison said the kind jeronymo speaks by action it is his way his head his heart his lips his hands are governed by one motion and directed by one spring when he leaves no room for doubt professions would depreciate his service  he then ascribed an extraordinary merit to me on my leaving my native country and friends to attend them in person  we may perhaps my reverend friend be allowed to repeat the commendations given us by grateful and benevolent friends when we cannot otherwise so well do justice to the generous warmth of such exalted spirits the noble jeronymo i am confident were he in my place and i in his would put a more moderate value on the like services done by himself what is friendship if on the like calls and blessed with power it is not ready to exert itself in action  grandison replied the bishop were he one of us might expect canonization in a better religion we have but few young men of quality and fortune so good as he though i think none so bad as many of the pretended reformed who travel as if to copy our vices and not to imitate our virtues  i was overwhelmed with gratitude on a reception so very generous and unreserved camilla came in seasonably with a message from the young lady inviting my attendance on her in her dressing room  the marchioness withdrew just before i followed camilla she told me as we went that she thought her not quite so sedate as she had been for some days past which she supposed owing to her hurrying in dressing and to her expectation of me  the mother and daughter were together they were talking when i entered  dear fanciful girl i heard the mother say disposing otherwise some flowers that she had in her bosom  clementina when her mind was sound used to be all unaffected elegance i never saw but one woman who equalled her in that respect miss byron seems conscious that she may trust to her native charms yet betrays no pride in her consciousness who ever spoke of her jewels that beheld her face for mingled dignity and freedom of air and manner these two ladies excel amongst women  clementina appeared exceedingly lovely but her fancifulness in the disposition of her ornaments and the unusual luster of her eyes which every one was wont to admire for their serene brightness showed an imagination more disordered than i hoped to see and gave me pain at my entrance  the chevalier my love said the marchioness turning round to me clementina receive your friend  she stood up dignity and sweetness in her air i approached her she refused not her hand the general madam and his lady salute you by me  they received you i am sure as the friend of our family but tell me sir smiling have you not exceeded your promised time  two or three days only  only sir  well i upbraid you not no wonder that a man so greatly valued cannot always keep his time  she hesitated looked at her mother at me and on the floor visibly at a loss then as sensible of her wandering turned aside her head and took out her handkerchief  mrs beaumont madam said i to divert her chagrin sends you her compliments  were you at florence  mrs beaumont said you  were you at florence then running to her mother she threw her arms about her neck hiding her face in her bosom  o madam conceal me conceal me from myself i am not well  be comforted my best love wrapping her maternal arms about her and kissing her forehead you will be better presently  i made a motion to withdraw the marchioness by her head approving i went into the next apartment  she soon enquired for me and on notice from camilla i returned  she sat with her head leaning on her mothers shoulder she raised it  excuse me sir said she i cannot be well i see  but no matter i am better and i am worse than i was worse because i am sensible of my calamity  her eyes had then lost all that luster which had shown a too raised imagination but they were as much in the other extreme overclouded with mistiness dimness vapors swimming in tears  i took her hand be not disheartened madam you will be soon well these are usual turns of the malady you seem to be so sensible of when it is changing to perfect health  god grant it  o chevalier what trouble have i given my friends  my mamma here  you sir  everybody o that naughty laurana but for her  but tell me  is she dead  poor cruel creature is she no more  would you have her to be no more my love said her mother  o no no i would have had her to live and to repent was she not the companion of my childhood she loved me once i always loved her say chevalier is she living  i looked at the marchioness as asking if i should tell her she was and receiving her approving nod she is living madam answered i  and i hope will repent   is she is she indeed my mamma interrupted she  she is my dear  thank god rising from her seat clasping her hands and standing more erect than usual then have i a triumph to come said the noble creature excuse my pride i will show her that i can forgive her  but i will talk of her when i am better you say sir i shall be better you say that my malady is changing  what comfort you give me  then dropping down against her mothers chair on her knees her eyes and hands lifted up great and good god almighty heal heal i beseech thee my wounded mind that i may be enabled to restore to the most indulgent of parents the happiness i have robbed them of join your prayers with mine sir you are a good man  but you madam are a catholic the chevalier is not  do you pray for me i shall be restored to your prayers and may i be restored as i shall never more do anything wilfully to offend or disturb your tenderheart  god restore my child sobbed the indulgent parent raising her  camilla had not withdrawn she stood weeping in a corner of the room camilla said the young lady advancing toward her lend me your arm i will return to you again sir  dont go  excuse me madam for a few moments i find putting her hand to her forehead i am not quite well  i will return presently  the marchioness and i were extremely affected by her great behavior but though we were grieved for the pain her sensibility gave her yet we could not but console and congratulate ourselves upon it as affording hopes of her perfect recovery  she returned soon attended by camilla who having been soothing her appealed to me whether i did not think she would soon be quite well  i answered that i had no question of it  look you there now my dear lady  i thought you said so chevalier but i was not sure god grant it my affliction is great my mamma i must have been a wicked creature  pray for me  her mother comforted her praised her and raised her dejected heart and then clementina looking down a blush overspreading her face and standing motionless as if considering of something  what is in my childs thoughts said the marchioness taking her hand what is my love thinking of  why madam in a low but audible voice i should be glad to talk with the chevalier alone methinks he is a good man but if you think i ought not i will not desire it in everything i will be governed by you yet i am ashamed what can i have to say that my mother may not hear  nothing nothing your clementinas heart madam is a part of yours  my love shall be indulged in every thing you and i camilla will retire  clementina was silent and both withdrew  she commanded me to sit down by her i obeyed it was not in the situation i was in for me to speak first i attended her pleasure in silence  she seemed at a loss she looked round her then at me then on the floor i could not then forbear speaking  the mind of lady clementina said i seems to have something upon it that she wishes to communicate you have not madam a more sincere a more faithful friend than the man before you your happiness and that of my jeronymo engross all my cares honor me with your confidence  i had something to say i had many questions to ask  but pity me sir my memory is gone i have lost it all  but this i know that we are all under obligations to you which we never can return and i am uneasy under the sense of them  what madam have i done but answered to the call of friendship which in the like situation not any one of your family but would have obeyed   this generous way of thinking adds to the obligation say but sir in what way we can express our gratitude in what way i in particular can and i shall be easy till we have done it i never shall  and can you madam think that i am not highly rewarded in the prospect of that success which opens to all our wishes  it may be so in your opinion but this leaves the debt still heavier upon us  how could i avoid construing the hint in my favor and yet i did not think the lady even had she not had parents in being had she been absolutely independent well enough to determine for herself in a situation so delicate how then could i in honor all her friends expecting that i should be entirely governed by her motions as they were resolved to be take direct advantage of the gratitude which at that instant possessed her noble mind  if madam answered i you will suppose yourselves under obligations to me and will not be easy till you have acknowleged them the return must be a family act let me refer myself to your father mother brothers and to yourself what you and they determine upon must be right  after a short silence  well sir i believe you have put the matter upon a right footing but here is my difficulty  you cannot be rewarded i cannot reward you but sir the subject begins to be too much for me i have high notions  my duty to god and to my parents my gratitude to you  but i have begun to write down all that has occurred to me on this important subject i wish to act greatly you sir have set me the example i will continue to write down my thoughts i cannot trust to my memory  no nor yet to my heart  but no more on a subject that is at present too affecting to me i will talk to my mother upon it first but not just now though i will ask for the honor of her presence  she then went from me into the next room and instantly returned leading in the marchioness dont dear madam be angry with me i had many things to say to the chevalier which i thought i could best say when i was alone with him but i forget what they were indeed i ought not to remember them if they were such as i could not say before my mother  my child cannot do anything that can make me displeased with her the chevaliers generosity and my clementinas goodness of heart can neither of them be doubted  o madam what a deep sense have i of yours and of my fathers indulgence to me how shall i requite it  how unworthy should i be of that returning reason which sometimes seems to enliven my hope if i were not to resolve that it shall be wholly employed in my duty to god and to you both but even then my gratitude to that generous man will leave a burden upon my heart that never can be removed  she withdrew with precipitation leaving the marchioness and me in silence looking upon each other and admiring her camilla followed her and instantly returning  my dear young lady  dont be frightened madam  is not well she seems to have exhausted her spirits by talking  tbe marchioness hastened in with camilla and while i was hesitating whether to withdraw to jeronymo or to quit the palace camilla came to me  my young lady asks for you sir  i followed her to her closet she was in her mothers arms on a couch just come out of a fit but not a strong one she held out her hand to me i pressed it with my lips i was affected with her nobleness of mind and weakness of spirit  o chevalier said she how unworthy am i of that tenderness which you express for me o that i could be grateful  but god will reward you he only can  she desired her mother and me to leave her to her camilla we both withdrew  what can be done with this dear creature chevalier she is going to be bad again  o sir her behavior is now different from what it ever was  she seems madam to have something on her mind that she has a difficulty to reveal when she has revealed it she will be easier you will prevail upon her madam by your condescending goodness to communicate it to you allow me to withdraw to signor jeronymo lady clementina when she is a little recovered will acquaint you with what passed between her and me  i heard it all replied she and you are the most honorable of men what man would what man could have acted as you acted with regard to her with regard to us yet not slight the dear creatures manifest meaning but refer it to us and to her to make it a family act a family act it must ir shall be only sir let me be assured that my childs malady will not lessen your love for her and permit her to be a catholic  these are all the terms i for my part have to make with you the rest of us still wish that you would be so though but in appearance for the sake of our alliances but i will not expect an answer to the last as to the first you cannot be ungenerous to one who has suffered so much for her love of you  the marquis and the bishop entering the room i leave it to you madam said i to acquaint their lordships with what has passed i will attend signor jeronymo for a few moments  i went accordingly to his chamber but being told that he was disposed to rest i withdrew with mr lowther into his and there camilla coming to me mr lowther retiring she told me that her young lady was pretty well recovered it was evident to her she said that she never would be well till the marriage was solemnized they are all said she in close conference together i believe upon that subject my young lady is endeavoring to compose herself in her closet the marchioness hopes you will stay and dine here  i excused myself from dining and desired her to tell her lady that i would attend them in the evening  i am now preparing to do so  letter xvii sir charles grandison in continuation bologna june     now my dear friend are matters here drawing to a crisis i was conducted as soon as i entered this palace to the presence of the marquis and marchioness the marquis arose and took my hand with great but solemn kindness and led me to a chair placed between theirs the bishop the count and father marescotti entered and took their places  my dear said the marquis referring to his lady   after some little hesitation  we have no hope sir said she of our childs perfect restoration but from  she stopped   our compliance with every wish of her heart said the bishop  ay do you proceed said the marchioness to the prelate  it would be to no purpose chevalier questioned the bishop to urge to you the topic so near to all our hearts  i bowed my assent to what he said  i am sorry for it replied the bishop  i am very sorry for it said the count  what security can we ask of you sir said the marquis that our child shall not be perverted  o chevalier it is a hard hard trial  father marescotti answered i shall prescribe the terms  i cannot in conscience said the father consent to this marriage yet the merits of the chevalier grandison have taken from me the power of opposing it permit me to be silent  father marescotti and i said the bishop are in one situation as to scruples of conscience but i will forget the prelate for the brother dear grandison will you permit us to say to enquirers that we look upon you as one of our church and that prudential reasons with regard to your country and friends in it deter you at present from declaring yourself  let not terms be proposed my good lord that would lessen your opinion of me should i comply with them if i am to be honored with an admission into this noble family let me not in my own eyes appear unworthy of the honor were i to find myself capable of prevaricating in an article so important as religion no one could hate me so much as i should hate myself were even an imperial diadem with your clementina the noblest of women to be the consideration  you have the example of great princes chevalier said father marescotti henry the fourth of france augustus of poland   true father  but great princes are not always and in every action of their lives great men they might make the less scruple of changing their religion as they were neither of them strict in the practice of it they who can allow themselves in some deviations may in others i boast not of my own virtue but it has been my aim to be uniform i am too well satisfied with my own religion to doubt if i were not it would be impossible but i must be influenced by the wishes of friends so dear to me whose motives are the result of their own piety and of the regard they have for my everlasting welfare  the chevalier and i rejoined the bishop have carried this argument to its full extent before my honored lords question recurs what security can we have that my sister shall not be perverted the chevalier refers to father marescotti to propose it the father excuses himself i as the brother of clementina ask you chevalier will you promise never by yourself or your english divines to attempt to pervert her  a confessor you have allowed her shall father marescotti be the man  and will father marescotti   i will for the sake of preserving to lady clementina her faith that faith by which only she can be saved and perhaps in hope of converting the man who then will be dear to the whole family  i not only comply with the proposal but shall think father marescotti will do me a favor in putting it into my power to show him the regard i have for him one request i have only to make that father marescotti will prescribe his own conditions to me and i assure you all that they shall be exceeded as to the consideration be they ever so high  you and i chevalier replied the father shall have no difficulty as to the terms  none you can have said the marquis as to those father marescotti will be still our spiritual director  only one condition i will beg leave to make with father marescotti that he will confine his pious cares to those only who are already of his own persuasion and that no disputable points may ever be touched upon to servants tenants or neighbors in a country where a different religion from that to which he is a credit is established i might perhaps have safely left this to his own moderation and honor yet without such a previous engagement his conscience might have been embarrassed and had i not insisted on it i should have behaved toward my country in a manner for which i could not answer to my own heart  your countrymen chevalier said the count complain loudly of persecution from our church yet what disqualifications do catholics lie under in england  a great deal my lord may be said on this subject i think it sufficient to answer for myself and my own conduct  as to our childs servants said the marchioness methinks i should hope that father marescotti might have a small congregation about him to keep their lady in countenance in a country where her religion will subject her to inconveniences perhaps to more than inconveniences  her woman and those servants replied i who will immediately attend her person shall always be chosen by herself if they behave well i will consider them as my servants for their benefit if they misbehave i must be allowed to consider them also as my servants as well as their ladys i must not be subject to the dominion of servants the most intolerable of all dominion were they to know that they are independent of me i should be disobeyed perhaps insulted and my resentment of their insolence would be thought a persecution on account of their religion  this article bore some canvassing if camilla at last i said were the woman on her discretion i should have great dependence   and on father marescottis you also may chevalier said the bishop i should hope that when my sister and you are in england together you would not scruple to consult him on the misbehaviour of any of my sisters catholic servants  indeed my lord i would i will myself be judge in my own house of the conduct and behavior of all my servants from the independence of such people upon me disputes or uneasinesses might arise that otherwise would never happen between their lady and me the power of dismission on any flagrant misbehaviour must be in me my temper is not capricious my charity is not confined my consideration for people in a foreign country and wholly in my power will i hope be even generous i perhaps may bear with them the more for having them in my power but my wifes servants were she a sovereign must be mine  unhappy said father marescotti that you can not be of one faith but sir you will allow i hope if the case will bear it of expostulation from me  yes father and should generally i believe be determined by your advice and mediation but i would not condition to make the greatest saint and the wisest man on earth a judge in my own family over me  there is reason in this rejoined the bishop you perhaps would not scruple sir to consult the marchioness before you dimissed such a considerable servant as a woman if my sister did not agree to it  the marquis and marchioness will be judges of my conduct when i am in italy i should despise myself were it not to be the same in england as at bologna i have in my travels been attended by catholic servants they never had reason to complain of want of kindness even to indulgence from me we protestants confine not salvation within the pale of our own church catholics do and have therefore an argument for their zeal in endeavoring to make proselvtes that we have not hence generally speaking may a catholic servant live more happily with a protestant master than a protestant servant with a catholic master let my servants live but up to their own professions and they shall be indulged with all reasonable opportunities of pursuing the dictates of their own consciences a truly religious servant of whatever persuasion cannot be a bad one  well as to this article we must leave it acquiesced the bishop to occasions as they may arise nine months in the year i think you propose to reside in italy   that my lord was on a supposition that lady clementina would not oblige me with her company to my native country any part of the year in that case i proposed to pass but three months in every year in my native country otherwise i hoped that year and year in turn would be allowed me  we can have no wish to separate man and wife said the marquis clementina will no doubt accompany her husband we will stipulate only for year and year but let ours be the first year and we cannot doubt but the dear child will meet with all reasonable indulgence for the sake of her tender health  not one request that you my lord and you madam shall think reasonable shall be denied to the dear lady  let me propose one thing chevalier said the marchioness that in the first year which is to be ours you endeavor to prevail upon your sisters amiable women as we have heard they are to come over and be of our acquaintance your ward also who may be looked upon as a little italian you love your sisters and i should be glad so would clementina i make no doubt to be familiarized to the ladies of your family before she goes to england  my sisters madam are the most obliging of women as their lords are of men i have no doubt of prevailing upon them to attend you and lady clementina here and as it will give them time to prepare for the visit i believe if it be made in the latter part of the first year it will be most acceptable to them and to you since then they will not only have commenced a friendship with lady clementina and obtained the honor of your good opinion but will attend the dear lady in her voyage to england  they all approved of this i added that i hoped when the second year arrived i should have the honor of finding in the party some of this noble family looking round me which could not fail of giveing delight as well as affiance to the tender heart of their beloved clementina  my lord and i said the marchioness will probably if well be of the party we shall not know how to part with a child so dear to us  but these seas   well well said the bishop this is a contingence and must be left to time and to the chevalier and my sister when they are one as his is the strongest mind it will in all reasonable matters yield to the weaker  now as to my sisters fortune   it is a large one said the count we shall all take pleasure in adding to it  should there be more sons than one by the marriage rejoined the bishop as the estate of her two grandfathers will be an ample provision for one of them and your english estate for another i hope we may expect that the education of one of them may be left to us  every one said this was a very reasonable expectation  i cannot condition for this my lord the education of the sons was to be left to me that of the daughters to the mother i will consent that the italian estate shall be tied up for daughters portions and that they shall be brought up under your own eyes italians the sons shall have no benefit by the italian estate   except they become catholics chevalier added the bishop  no my lord replied i that might be a temptation  though i would leave posterity as free as i myself am left in the article of religion yet would i not lay any snares for them i am for having them absolutely secluded from any possibility of enjoying that estate as they will be englishmen cannot this be done by the laws of your country and the tenure by which these estates are held  if clementina marry said the marquis whether there be issue or not lauranas claim ceases but chevalier can you think it just to deprive children unborn of their natural right  i have a very good estate it is improving i have considerable expectations besides that is not mine which i do not possess and shall have no right to but by marriage and which therefore must and ought to be subject to marriagearticles riches never made men happy if my descendants will not be so with a competence they will not with a redundance i hope signor jeronymo may recover and marry let the estate here from the hour that i shall be honored with the hand of your dear clementina be jeronymos and his posteritys for ever if it shall be thought proper for him on taking possession to make his sister any brotherly acknowlegement it shall be to her sole and separate use and not subject to any control of mine if signor jeronymo marry not or if he do and die without issue let the estate in question be the generals he and his lady deserve everything the estate shall not by my consent go out of the name  they looked upon each other  brother said the count i see not but we may leave everything to the generosity of such a young man as this he quite overcomes me  a disinterested and generous man rejoined the bishop is born a ruler and he is at the same time the greatest of politicians were policy only to be considered  the most equitable medium i think resumed the marchioness is what the chevalier hinted at  and most answerable to the intention of the dear childs grandfathers it is that the estate in question be secured to the daughters of the marriage our sons will be greatly provided for and it will be rewarding in some measure the chevalier for his generosity that the sons of the marriage shall not have their patrimony lessened by the provision to be made for daughters  they all generously applauded the marchioness and proposing this expedient to me i bowed my grateful assent  see chevalier said father marescotti what a generous family you are likely to be allied with o that you could be subdued by a goodness so much like your own and declare yourself a catholic his holiness himself my lord the bishop could engage would receive you with blessings at the footstool of his throne you allow sir that salvation may be obtained in our church out of it we think it cannot rejoice us all rejoice lady clementina  and let us know no bound in our joy  what opinion my dear father marescotti would you all have of the man who could give up his conscience though for the highest consideration on earth  did you could you think the better of the two princes mentioned to me for the change of their religion one of them was assassinated in the streets of his metropolis by an ecclesiastic who questioned the sincerity of his change could the matter be of indifference to me  but my dear father marescotti let us leave this to be debated hereafter between you and me as father and son your piety shall command my reverence but pain not my heart by putting me on denial of anything that shall be asked of me by such respectable and generous persons as those i am before and when we are talking on a subject so delicate and so important  father marescotti we must give up this point said the bishop the chevalier and i have discussed it heretofore he is a determined man if you hereafter can gain upon him you will make us all happy but now my lord to the marquess let the chevalier know what he will have with my sister besides the bequests of her grandfathers from your bounty and from yours madam to his mother as a daughter of your house  i beg my lord one word said i to the marquis before you speak let not a syllable of this be mentioned to me now whatever you shall be pleased to do of this nature let it be done annually as my behavior to your daughter may deserve do i not know the generosity of every one of this noble family let me be in your power i have enough for her and for me or i do not know the noble clementina whatever you do for the sake of your own magnificence that do but let us leave particulars unmentioned  what would lady sforza say were she present rejoined the count averse as she is to the alliance she would admire the man  are you earnest in your request chevalier asked the bishop that particulars shall not be mentioned  i beg they may not i earnestly beg it  pray let the chevalier be obliged returned the prelate  sir said he and snatched my hand brother friend what shall i call you  we will oblige you but not in doubt of your kind treatment of clementina she must she will deserve it but that we may have it in our power to be revenged of you sir we will take great revenge of you and let us now rejoice jeronymos heart with an account of all that has passed we might have held this conference before him all that is further necessary to be said may be said in his presence  who said father marescotti can hold out against the chevalier grandison i will tell every one who shall question me on this alliance zealous catholics with a protestant so determined what a man he is and then they will allow of this one particular exception to a general rule  all we have now to do said the marquis is to gain his holinesss permission that has not been refused in such cases where either the sons or daughters of the marriage are to be brought up catholics  the count then took the marchionesss hand the marquis that of the father they whispered together as they walked as i could hear not to my disadvantage the bishop took mine and we entered jeronymos chamber together i stepped into mr lowthers apartment while they related to him all that had passed he was impatient to see me the bishop led me in to him he embraced me as his brother now now my dear grandison said he i am indeed happy this is the point to which i have long directed all my wishes god grant that our dear clementinas malady may be no drawback upon your felicities and you must both then be happy  i was sensible of a little abatement on the bishops saying to his mother not knowing i heard him ah madam the poor count of belvedere  how will he be affected  but he will go to madrid and i hope make himself happy there with some spanish lady the poor count of belvedere returned the marchioness with a sigh  but he will not know how to blame us   tomorrow morning i am to drink chocolate with lady clementina we shall be left together perhaps or only with her mother or camilla  what my dear dr bartlett would i give to be assured that the most excellent of englishwomen could think herself happy with the earl of d the only man of all her admirers who is in any manner worthy of calling so bright a jewel his should miss byron be unhappy and through my means the remembrance of my own caution and selfrestraint could not appease the grief of my heart  but so prudent a woman as she is and as the countess of d is  what are these suggestions of tenderness  are they not suggestions of vanity and presumption they are they must be so i will banish them from my thoughts as such ever amiable miss byron friend of my soul forgive me for them  yet if the noble clementina is to be mine my heart would be greatly gratified if before she receive my vows i could know that miss byron had given her hand in compliance with the entreaties of all her friends to the deserving earl of d having an opportunity i dispatch this and my two former in you i include remembrances to all my beloved friends  adieu my dear dr bartlett in the highest of our pleasures the sighing heart will remind us of imperfection it is fit it should be so  adieu my dear friend  charles grandison   continuation of lady gs letter to lady l no xiv begun page    and dated july     well my dear sister  and what say you to the contents of the three enclosed letters i wish i had been with you and lord l at the time you read them that i might have mingled my tears with yours for the sweet harriet why would my brother dispatch these letters without staying till at least he could have informed us of the result of the next days meeting with clementina what was the opportunity that he had to send away these letters which he must be assured would keep us in strange suspense lang the opportunity that so officiously offered  but perhaps in the tenderness of his nature he thought that this dispatch was necessary to prepare us for what was to follow lest were he to acquaint us with the event as decided our emotion would be too great to be supported  we sisters to go over to attend lady clementina grandison a twelvemonth hence  ah the poor harriet and will she give us leave but it surely must not cannot be  and yet  hush hush hush charlotte  and proceed to facts  dr bartlett when these letters were brought him post from london was with us at table we had but just dined he arose and retired to his own apartment with them we were all impatient to know the contents when i thought he had withdrawn long enough to read dispatches of a mile long and yet found that he returned not my impatience was heightened and the dear harriet said bad news i fear i hope sir charles is well i hope lady clementina is not relapsed the good jeronymo i sear for him  i then stepped up to the doctors room he was sitting with his back toward the door in a pensive mood and when hearing somebody enter he turned about i saw he had been deeply affected   my dear dr bartlett  for gods sake  how is my brother   dont be affrighted madam all are well in italy  in a way to be well  but alas  tears started afresh  i am grieved for miss byron  how how doctor is my brother married  it cannot it shall not be  is my brother married  o no not married by these letters but all is concluded upon sweet sweet miss byron now indeed will her magnanimity be put to the test  yet lady clementina is a most excellent woman  you madam may read these letters miss byron i believe must not you will see by the concludeing part of the last how greatly embarrassed my patron must be between his honor to one lady and his tenderness for the other whichsoever shall be his how much will the other be to be pitied  i ran over with a weeping eye as the paragraphs struck me the passages most affecting o dr bartlett said i when i had done how shall we break this news to mrs selby to mrs shirley to my harriet  a trial indeed of her magnanimity  yet to have received letters from my brother and to delay going down will be as alarming as to tell it let us go down  do you madam take the letters you have tenderness your prudence cannot be doubted  i will attend you byandby his eyes were ready to run over  i went down i met my lord at the stairs foot how how madam does sir charles  o my lord we are all undone my brother by this time is the husband of lady clementina  he was struck as with a thunderbolt god forbid were all the words he could speak and turned as pale as death  i love him for his sincere love to my harriet i wrung his hand  the letters do not say it but everybody is consenting and if it be not already so it soon will  step my lord to mrs selby and tell her that i wish to see her in the flowergarden  miss byron and nancy said he are gone to walk in the garden she was so apprehensive on your staying above and the doctor not coming down that she was forced to walk into the air i left mr selby his lady emily and lucy in the diningparlour to find you and let you know how everybody was affected tears dropped on his cheeks  i gave him my hand in love i was pleased with him i called him my dear lord  i think our sweet friend once said that fear made us loving illnews will oblige us to look about us for consolation  i found the persons named just rising from their seats to walk in the garden  o my dear mrs selby said i all is agreed upon in italy  they were all dumb but emily her sorrow was audible she wrung her hands she was ready to faint her anne was called to take care of her and she retired  i then told mr and mrs selby what were the contents of the last letter of the three mr selby broke out into passionate grief  i know not what the honor is said he that could oblige sir charles treated as he had been by the proud italians to go over at the first invitation one might have guessed that it would have come to this  oh the poor harriet flower of the world she deserved not to be made a second woman to the stateliest minx in italy but this is my comfort she is superior to them both upon my soul madam she is the man were he a king that could prefer another woman to our harriet does not deserve her  he then rose from his seat and walked up and down the room in anger and afterward sitting down my dear mrs selby said he we shall now see what the so often pleaded for dignity of your sex in the noblestminded will enable you to do but o the dear soul she will find a difference between theory and practice  lucy wept her grief was silent mrs selby dried her eyes several times my dear lady g said she at last how shall we break this to harriet you must do it and she will apply to me for comfort  pray mr selby be patient you must not reflect upon sir charles grandison  indeed you should not sir said i he is to be pitied i will read you the concluding part of his last letter  i did  but mr selby would not be pacified he tried to blame my brother  after all my dear these lords of the creation are more violent more unreasonable and of consequence more silly and perverse more babies if you please than we women when they are disappointed in anything they set their hearts upon but in every case i believe one extreme borders on another what a fool has otway made of castalio raving against the whole sex by a commonplace invective on a mere temporary disappointment when the fault and all the dreadful consequences that attended it were owing to his own baseness of heart in being ashamed to acquaint his brother that he meant honorable love to the unhappy orphan who was entitled to inviolable protection whenever i saw this play i pitied the impetuous polydore more than i did the blubbering great boy castalio though i thought both brothers deserved to be hanged  as we were meditating how to break this matter to our lovely friend mrs shirley came to selbyhouse in her chariot we immediately acquainted her with it no surprises affect her steady soul this cannot be helped said she our dear girl herself expects it may i read the letter that contains the affecting tidings she took it she run it over slightly to enable herself to speak to the contents  excellent man  how happy should we have been blessed with the enjoyment of our wishes but you mrs selby and i have always pitied lady clementina his generous regard for our child is too apparent for his own tranquillity god comfort him and our harriet o the dear creature her fading cheeks have shown the struggles of her heart in such an expectation  where is my child  i was running out to see for her and met her just ascending the steps that lead from the garden into the house your grandmamma my love said i   i hear she is come answered she i am hastening to pay my duty to her  but how do you harriet  a little better for the air i sent up to dr bartlett and he has let me know that sir charles is well and everybody better and i am easy  she hurried in to her grandmother rejoicing as she always does to see her she kneeled received her tender blessing and what brings my grandmamma to her girl  the day is fine the air and the sight of my harriet i thought would do me good  you have letters i find from italy my love  i madam have not dr bartlett has but i am notto know the contents i suppose something i doubt not that will be thought unwelcome to me by their not being communicated but as long as everybody there is well i can have patience time will reveal all things  dr bartlett who admires the old lady and is as much admired by her came down and paid his respects to her mrs shirley had returned me the letters i slid them into the doctors hand unperceived by miss byron  i am told said she that my emily is not well i will just ask how she does  and was going from us  no dont my love said her aunt taking her hand emily shall come down to us  i see said she by the compassionate looks of everyone that something is the matter if it be anything that most concerns me to know dont through a mistaken tenderness let me be the last to whom it is communicated but i guess  with a forced smile  what does my harriet guess said her aunt  dr bartlett replied she has acquainted me that sir charles grandison is well and that his friends are on the recovery is it not then easy to guess by everyones silence on the contents of the letters brought to dr bartlett that sir charles is either married or near being so what say you my good dr bartlett  he was silent but tears were in his eyes she turned round and saw us with our handkerchiefs at ours her uncle rising from his seat stood with his back to us at one of the windows  well my dear friends and you are all grieved for me it is kind and i can thank you for your concern for me because the man is sir charles grandison  and so doctor laying her hand upon his he is actually married god almighty piously bending one knee make him and his clementina happy  well my dearest dear friends and what is there in this more than i expected  her aunt embraced her  her uncle ran to her and clasped his arms about her now now said he have you overcome me my niece for the future i never will dispute with you on some of the arguments i have heretofore held against your sex were all women like you   her grandmother as she sat held out her open arms my own harriet child of my heart let me fold you to it  she ran to her and clasped her knees as the old lady threw her arms about her neck  pray for me however my grandmamma  that i may act up to my judgment and as your child and my aunt selbys  it is a trial  i own it  but permit me to withdraw for a few moments  she arose and was hastening out of the room but her aunt took her hand my dearest love said she sir charles grandison is not married  but   why why interrupted she if it must be so is it not so  at that moment in came emily she had been trying to suppress her concern and fansied it seems that she had recovered her presence of mind but the moment she saw her beloved miss byron her fortitude forsook her she gushed into tears and sobbing would have quitted the room but miss byron stepping after her caught her arm my emily my love my friend my sister fly me not let me give you an example my dear  i am not ashamed to own myself affected but i have fortitude i hope  sir charles grandison when he could not be happy from his own affairs made himself a partaker in the happiness of others and shall not you and i after so great an example rejoice in his  i am i am  grieved replied the sobbing girl for my miss byron i dont love italian ladies were you madam turning to her lady grandison i should be the happiest creature in the world  but dr bartlett said i may we not now that miss byron knows the worst communicate to her the contents of these letters  i hope you will sir said mrs shirley you see that my harriet is a noble girl  i rely upon your judgments ladies answered the doctor and put the letters into mrs shirleys hands  i have read them said i we will leave mrs shirley mrs selby and miss byron together we lucy nancy emily will take a walk in the garden shall we have your company dr bartlett i saw he was desirous to withdraw lucy desired to stay behind harriet looked as if she wished lucy to stay and i led the other two into the garden dr bartlett leaving us at the entrance into it and i told them the contents of the letters as we walked  they were greatly affected as i thought they would be which made me lead them out lord g joined us in our walk as well as in our concern so that the dear harriet had none but comforters left about her who enabled her to support her spirits for mrs shirley and mrs selby had always applauded the preference their beloved child was so ready to give to clementina because of her malady though it is evident against their wishes there never were three nobler women related to each other than mrs shirley mrs selby and miss byron but mr selby is by no means satisfied that my brother loving harriet as he evidently does should be so ready to leave her and go to italy his censure arises from his love to my brother and to his niece but i need not tell you that though a man he has not a soul half so capacious as that of either of the three ladies i have named  at our return from our little walk it was lovely to see harriet take her emily aside to comfort her and to plead with her in favor of my brothers obligations as afterward she did against her uncle how the generous creature shone in my eyes and in those of everyone present  when she and i were alone she took grateful notice of the concluding part of the third letter where she is mentioned with so much tenderness and in a manner so truly worthy of the character of the politest of men as well respecting herself as her sex charging himself with vanity and presumption but to suppose to himself that miss byron wanted his compassion or had the tender regard for him that he avows for her she pleased herself that he had not seen the very great esteem she had for him as you and i had done and how could he you know said she for he and i were not often together and i was under obligation enough to him to make him attribute my regard to gratitude but it is plain proceeded she that he loves the poor harriet  dont you think so and perhaps would have given her a preference to all other women had he not been circumstanced as he was well god bless him added she he was my first love and i never will have any other  dont blame me for this declaration my dear lady g my grandmamma as well as you once chid me for saying so and called me romancer  but is not the man sir charles grandison  but alas with all these appearances it is easy to see that this amiable creatures solitary hours are heavy ones she has got a habit of sighing she rises with swelled eyes sleep forsakes her her appetite fails and she is very sensible of all this as she shows by the pains she takes to conceal the alteration  and must harriet byron blessed with beauty so unequalled health so blooming a temper so even passions so governable generous and grateful even to heroism  superior to every woman in frankness of heart in true delicacy and in an understanding and judgment beyond her years  must she be offered up as a victim on the altar of hopeless love  i deprecate such a fate  i cannot allow the other sex such a triumph though the man be my brother it is however none on the contrary it is apparently a grief to his noble and truly manly heart that so excellent a creature cannot be the sole mistress of it  mr deane came hither this morning he is a valuable man he opened his heart to me about an hour ago he always he says designed miss byron for the heiress of the principal part of his possessions and he let me know his circumstances which are great it is i am convinced true policy to be good young and old rich and poor dote upon miss byron you remember what her uncle says in his ludicrous letter to her covertly praising her by pretending to find fault with her that he is more noted for being the uncle of miss byron than she is for being his niece though of so long standing in the county and i assure you he is much respected too but such beauty such affability a character so benevolent so frank so pious yet so cheerful and unaffected as hers is must command the veneration and love of every one  mr deane is extremely apprehensive of her declineing health he believes her in a consumption and has brought a physician of his intimate acquaintance to visit her but she and we all are convinced that medicine will not reach her case and she affected to be startled at his supposing she was in so bad a way on purpose as she owned to avoid his kind importunity to take advice in a malady that nothing but time and patience can cure  a charming correspondence is carried on between harriet and the countess of d harriet is all frankness in it so is lady d one day i hope to procure you a sight of their letters i am allowed to enclose a copy of the countesss last you will see the force of the reasoning on harriets declaration that she will never think of a second lover her grandmother is entirely with the countess so am i  though the first was sir charles grandison  what will become of lady olivia if the alliance between my brother and the bologna family take effect  she has her emissaries who i suppose will soon apprise her of it how will she flame out i suppose you who correspond with her will soon be troubled with her invectives on this subject  all here wish for you and lord l for my part i long to see you both and to be seen by you you never could see me more to my advantage than now we have nothing between us but  what your lordship pleases my dearest life you have no choice you prevent me my lord in all my wishes  i have told him in love of some of his foibles and he thanks me for my instruction and is resolved to be all i wish him to be  i have made discoveries in his favor  more wit more humor more good sense more learning than i had ever till now that i was willing to enquire after those qualities in him imagined he had he allows me to have a vast share of good understanding and so he ought when i have made such discoveries to his advantage  in short we so monstrously improve upon each other that if we go on thus we shall hardly know ourselves to be the same man and woman that made such awkward figures in the eyes of all beholders a few months ago at st georges church and must be married over again to be sure of each other for you must believe that we would not be the same odd souls we then were on any account  what raises him with me is the good opinion everybody here has of him they also have found him out to be a man of sense a goodnatured man nay would you believe it a handsome man and all these people having deservedly the reputation of good sense penetration and soforth i cannot contradict them with credit to myself when we married folks have made a silly choice we should in policy you know for the credit of our judgment try to make the best of it i could name you half a score people who are continually praising the man his wife the woman her husband who were they at liberty to choose again would be hanged before they would renew their bargain  let me tell you that emily will make an excellent wife and mistress of a family miss byron is one of the best oeconomists and yet one of the finest ladies in the county as soon as she came down she resumed the family direction in ease of her aunt which was her province before she came to london i thought myself a tolerable manager but she has for ever stopped my mouth on this subject such a succession of orderliness if i may so call it one right thing is an introduction to another and all is in such a method that it seems impossible for the meanest servants to mistake their duty such harmony such observance yet such pleasure in every countenance  but she is mistress of so much ease so much dignity and so much condescension that she is worshipped by all the servants and it is observable hardly ever was heard to direct twice the same thing to be done or remembered  the servants have generally time for themselves an hour or two in a day her orders are given over night and as the family live in a genteel manner they are never surprised or put out of course by company the poor only have the less of the remnants if visiters or guests come in unexpectedly and in such case she says they shall fare better another day emily is taking minutes of all her management she is resolved to imitate her in everything hence it is that i say the girl will make one of the best wives in england yet how the dear harriet manages it i cannot tell for we hardly ever miss her but early hours and method and ease without hurry will do everything  postscript lord bless me my dear lady l i have been frightened out of my wits this lord g  what do we do by marriage but double our cares  he was taken very ill two hours ago a kind of fit the first reflection that crossed me when he was at worst was this  what a wretch was i to vex this poor man as i have done  happy happy is the wife in the depth of her affliction on the loss of a worthy husband happy the husband if he must be separated from a good wife who has no material cause for selfreproach to imbitter reflection as to his or her conduct to the departed ah caroline how little do we know of ourselves till the hour of trial comes i find i find i have more love for lord g than i thought i had or could have for any man  how have i exposed myself  but they none of them upbraid me with my apprehensions for the honest man he did fright me  a wretch  in his childhood he was troubled with these oddities it seems  he is so well that i had a good mind to quarrel with him for terrifying me as he did for better and for worse  a cheat  he should have told me that he had been subject to such an infirmity  and then from his apprehended fits though involuntary i should have claimed allowance for my real though wilful ones in which however i cheated not him he saw me in them many and many a good time before marriage  i have this moment yours i thought what would be the case with olivia she has certainly heard of the happy turn at bologna or she would not think of leaving england so soon when she had resolved to stay here till my brothers return unhappy woman harriet pities her  but she has pity for every one that wants it  repeatedly all here are earnest to get you and your lord with us do come if you can  were it but for one week and perhaps we will go up together if you dont come soon your folks will not suffer you to come one while after all my dear these men are as aunt nell would say odious creatures you are a good forgiving soul but that am not i in a few months time i shall be as grave as a cat i suppose but the sorry fellow knows nothing of the matter as yet   adieu lady l   letter xviii from the countess of d to miss byron inclosed in the preceding  july   my dear harriet has allowed me to write to her with the affectionate freedom of a mother as such i may go on to urge a subject disagreeable to her when not only the welfare of both my children is concerned in it but when her own honor her own delicacy of sentiment is peculiarly interested  pure and noble as your heart is it is misleading you my love oh my harriet into what a labyrinth  have you kept a copy my dear of your last letter to me it is all amiable all yourself  but it is harriet byron again in need of a rescuer  shall i my child save you from being run away with by these tyrannous overrefinements yes you will say could i do it disinterestedly well i will if i can imagine myself quite disinterested suppose my son out of the case and since i have told you more than once that i cannot allow the sacredness young people are apt to imagine in a first love i must you know take it for granted that even his to you is not absolutely unconquerable  let us then consider a little the bright fairy schemes for so i must call them which you have formed in the letter that lies before me this letter appears not  do not your excellent grandmamma and aunt see them in the same light i dare say they do but to one i love so dearly how can i omit to offer my hand to extricate her out of a maze of bewildering fancy in which she may else tread many a weary step that ought to be advancing forward in the paths of happiness and duty  think but my dear child what fortitude of soul what strength even of constitution you answer for when you talk of living happy in friendship with two persons when they are united by indissoluble ties the very thought of whose union makes your cheek fade and your health languish ah my beloved harriet is not this a fairyscheme  mistake me not my love i suspect not that your sentiments would want anything of the purity the generosity the true heroism required in the idea of a friendship like that you talk of i suspect not in the noble pair does that phrase hurt you my miss byron think then how your heart would suffer in the lasting conflict that must accompany the situation which you have proposed to yourself i suspect not in either of them sentiments or behavior unsuitable to your excellence yet let me ask you one thing would not the example of such an attachment subsisting between persons known to have once had different views and tenderer affections mislead less delicate and less guarded minds into allowances dangerous to them and subject souls less great than clementina to jealousies whether warrantable or not of friendships that should plead yours for a president  do not be impatient my dear i have a great deal more to say this friendship what is it to be not more than friendship disguised under the name of it for how can that consist with your peace of mind your submission to the dictates of reason your resignation to the will of providence if then it be only friendship how is it inconsistent with your forming an attachment of a nearer kind with a person of merit who approves of and will join in it what think you my dear is that love which we vow at the altar surely not adoration not a preference of that object absolutely as in excellence superior to every other imaginable being no more surely in most cases than such a preferable choice all circumstances considered as shall make us with satisfaction of mind and with an affectionate and faithful heart unite ourselves for life with a man whom we esteem who we think is no disagreeable companion but deserves our grateful regard that his interest from henceforth should be our own and his happiness our study and is not this very consistent my dear with admiring and loving the excellence of angels and even with seeing and pitying in this partner of our lives such imperfections as make him evidently their inferior inferior even to such human angels as you and i have in our heads at this moment  observe my dear i say only that such friendship is very consistent with being more nearly united to one who knows and approves it for concealment of any thought that much affects the heart is i think in such a case with very few exceptions from very particular circumstances utterly unallowable and blameably indelicate  you are my dear i will not offend you by saying to what degree a reasonable and prudent young woman pious dutiful and benevolent consider then how much better you would account for the talents committed to you how much more joy you would give to the best of friends how much more good you would do to your fellow creatures by permitting yourself to be called out into active life with all its variety of relations than you can while you continue obstinately in a single state on purpose to indulge a remediless sorrow the domestic connexions would engage you in a thousand not unpleasing new cares and attentions that must inevitably wear out in time impressions which you would feel it unfit to indulge all that is generous grateful reasonable in your very just attachment would remain everything that passion and imagination have added every unreasonable every painful emotion would be banished and the friendship between the two families become a source of lasting happiness to both  adieu my harriet i am afraid of being tedious on an unpleasing subject if i have omitted anything material in this argument the excellent parents you are with can abundantly supply it from their own reason and experience of the world assure them of my unfeigned regard and believe me my dear child with a degree of esteem that no young creature ever merited half so well  your trulyaffectionate m d   pinned on by lady g dont you think lady l that the contents of this letter ought to have the more weight with harriet as were she to be lady grandison they would suit her own case and emilys were emily to make the same pretensions to a perpetual single life on the improbability of marrying her first love i shall freely speak my mind upon this subject when harriet can better bear the argument letter xix from the earl of g to lady g my dear daughter tuesday aug   let me be excused for asking you a question by pen and ink when do you think of returning from northamptonshire lady gertrude and i are out of all patience with you not with lord g we know that wherever you are there will he wish to be his treasure and his heart must be together but to me who always loved my son to lady gertrude who always loved her nephew and who equally rejoiced in the happy event that gave me a daughter and her a niece what can you say in excuse for robbing us of both it is true miss byron is a lady that ought to be half the world to you but must the other half have no manner of regard paid to it i have enquired of lord and lady l but they say you are so far from setting your time for return that you are pressing them to go down to you what can my daughter mean by this have you taken a house in northamptonshire have you forgot that you have taken one in grosvenor square everything is done there that you had ordered to be done and all are at a stand for further directions let me tell you lady g that my sister and i love you both too well to bear to be thus slighted love us but half as well and you will tell us the day of your return you dont consider that we are both in years and that in all probability you may often rejoice in the company you are with when you cannot have ours excuse this serious conclusion i am serious upon the subject  and why because i love you with a tenderness truly paternal pray make mine and my sisters compliments acceptable to the loveliest woman in england and to every one whom she loves who are now in northamptonshire i am my dearest daughter  your everaffectionate g  letter xx lady g to the right honorable the earl of g selbyhouse aug   o my dear lord what do you mean are you and lady gertrude really angry with me i cannot bear the serious conclusion of your letter may you both live long and be happy if my affectionate duty to you both will contribute to your felicity it shall not be wanting i was so happy here that i knew not when i should have returned to town had you not so kindly as to your intention yet so severely in your expressions admonished me i will soon throw myself at your feet and by the next post will fix the day on which i hope to be forgiven by you both let lord g answer for himself upon my word he is as much to blame as i am nay more for he dotes upon miss byron  duty i avow pardon i beg never more my dear and honored lord shall you have like reason to chide  your everdutiful daughter nor you my dear lady gertrude your most obedient kinswoman charlotte g  letter xxi lady g to miss byron london sat aug   thank you my reverend and dear mrs shirley mrs selby and harriet the lovely and beloved thank you my dear lucy and nancy selby and kitty and patty holles and good miss orme and you my dear disputatious uncle selby and honest cousin james and all the rest of you for your particular graces favors civilities and goodness superabundant to my bustling lord and his lively dame let the good doctor and emily thank you for themselves  and who do you think met us at st albans  why beauchamp sir harry and my lady and mr and mrs reeves  poor sir harry he is in a very bad way and lady beauchamp and his son who peradventure had a reason he gave not prevailed upon him to make this little excursion in hopes it would divert him they had not for some weeks past seen him so cheerful as we made him  aunt nell met us at barnet with cicely badger her still older woman whom she keeps about her to make herself look young on comparison  but a piece of bad news harriet our aunt nell has lost two more of her upper foreteeth a vile bit of bone o how she execrates it which lurked in a fricasee did the irreparable mischief and the good old soul is teaching her upperlip when she speaks to resign all motion to the under one that it may as little as possible make the defect visible what poor wretches are we harriet men as well as women we pray for long life and what is the issue of our prayers but leave to outlive our teeth and our friends to stand in the way of our elbowing relations and to change our swanskins for skins of buff which nevertheless will keep out neither cold nor infirmity but i shall be serious byandby and what is the design of my penprattle but to make my sweet harriet smile  the earl and lady gertrude made up differences with me at first sight the lady is a little upon the fallal a little aunt nellish but i protest i love her and reverence her brother  beauchamp is certainly in love with emily when he first addressed her at st albans his hands trembled his cheeks glowed his tongue faltered  so young a gipsey to make a conquest of such importance we women are powerful creatures harriet as they say of horses if we knew our own strength and could have a little more patience than we generally have we might do what we would with the powerless lords of the creation in my conscience harriet look all my acquaintance through of both sexes i think there are three silly fellows to one silly woman dont you think so in yours  are your grevilles your fenwicks your ormes your fowlers your pollexfens your bagenhalls and half a score more i could name to be put in competition with mrs shirley mrs selby lady d our lucy nancy miss orme the two miss holless  let uncle selby and cousin james determine on the question  i am half in hopes that the little rogue emily will draw herself in beauchamp is modest yet not sheepish he is prudent manly lively has address he will certainly draw her in before she knows where she is and how why by praising sincerely and loving cordially the man at present most dear to her when he first addressed her at st albans o mr beauchamp said she with an innocent freedom not regarding his tremblings his glow and his falterings i am glad to see you i long to have you entertain me with stories of my guardian but ah sir speaking lower and with a fallen countenance tears ready to start whose whose is he by this time yet if you know it dont tell me it must not must not be  the praises given to those we really love i believe are more grateful to us than those conferred on ourselves i will tell you how i account for this in general cases my brother out of the question  we doubt not our own merits but may be afraid that the favored object will not be considered by others as we are willing to consider him but if he is we take the praise given him as a compliment to our own judgment selflove selflove at the bottom of all we say and do i am convinced it is notwithstanding all you have urged to the contrary generally you know i said do you think i will allow you to judge of the generality of the world by what you find in one of the best hearts in it  an instance in point  i remember a miss hurste a sweet pretty creature and very sensible she had from her chamberwindow been shot through the heart by the blind archer who took his stand on the feather of a military man marching at the head of his company through the market town in which she lived yet was her susceptibility her only inducement for the man was neither handsome in his person nor genteel in his appearance nor could she be in love with the sense of a man had he been a solomon whose mouth she never saw opened and to whose character she was as much a stranger as he was to hers or her person till she contrived to have him made acquainted with his good fortune constant however to her first foolish impression she in opposition to all advice and the expostulations of a tender and indulgent mother married him a solomon he was not and when he at any time by virtue of his relation to her was introduced into her family how would she blush whenever he opened his mouth and how did her eyes sparkle with gratitude upon any one who took the least respectful notice of him compliments to herself were unheeded but she seemed ready to throw herself at the feet of those who smiled upon and directed themselves to her captain poor girl she wanted to give credit to the motive by which she had been acted  now harriet i charge you that you think not that this mans name was anderson somebody met with an escape yet nowandthen i blush for somebody yet between this somebody and miss hurstes cases there was this difference  a fathers apprehended  tyranny  shall i call it impressing the one a tindery fit the other in the one a timely recovery in the other the first folly deliberately confirmed  dear dear harriet let me make you smile  i protest if you will not i will talk of lord d and then i know you will frown  the excellent lady of that name has already been to welcome us to town she absolutely dotes upon you so she says does the young earl she prays day and night she tells me that my brother may soon come to england his italian bride in his hand she expects every post to hear from sir arthur brandon who has carried a letter from her and another from the earl of n recommending that promising young gentleman to my brothers favor on his visiting italy she hopes my brother will not take amiss her freedom at so short an acquaintance if sir arthur sends her such news as she wishes and we dread to hear away drives she to northamptonshire  and should she i dont know who will scruple to wish her success for her young man rises every day in his character my dear creature you must you shall be in our row and lady ds last letter to you is unanswerable forgive me for touching upon this subject but we have no hopes you have nothing to fear since you expect what the next mails will bring and who of us after all have our first love aunt nell would not have descended sola into her greys nor cicely badger neither if they might have obtained the men of their choice  poor aunt nell she has been telling me her taken off spectacles in her fingers of a disappointment of this kind in her youth with such woeful earnestness that it made me ready to cry for her she lays it at the door of her brother my poor father and now will you wonder that to this hour she cannot speak of him with patience  poor aunt nell  well but how do you my love for heavens sake be well could i make you speak out could i make you complain i should have some hope of you but so sorrowful when alone as we plainly see yet aiming to be so cheerful in company  o my dear you must be gluttonous of grief in your solitary hours but what though the man be sir charles grandison is not the woman harriet byron  lady l tells me that olivia behaved like a distracted woman when she took leave of her on her setting out to return to italy she sometimes wept sometimes raved and threatened wretched woman surely she will not attempt the life of the man she so ungovernably loves our case harriet is not so hard as hers but she will sooner get over her talkative than you will your silent love when a person can rave the passion is not dangerous if the head be safe pride and supposed slight will in time harden the heart of such a one and her love will be swallowed up by resentment  you complimented me on my civility to my good man all the time we were with you indeed i was very civil to him it is now become a habit and i verily think that it looks well in man and wife to behave prettily to each other before company i nowandthen however sit down with a full design to make him look about him but he is so obliging that i am constrained against my intention to let the fit go off without making him very serious  am i conceited harriet which of the two silly folks do you think has most not wit  wit is a foolish thing but understanding i think the woman has it all to nothing  now dont mortify me if you pretend to doubt i will be sure upon my word my dear i am an excellent creature so thinking so assured to behave so obligingly as i do to lord g never never unless a woman has as much prudence as your charlette let her wed a man who has less understanding than herself but women marry not so much nowadays for love or fitness of tempers as for the liberty of gadding abroad with less censure and less control  and yet now i think of it we need only to take a survey of the flocks of single women which crowd to ranelagh and vauxhall markets dressed out to be cheapened not purchased to be convinced that the maids are as much above either shame or control as the wives but were not fathers desirous to get the drugs off their hands to express myself in young danbys saucy style these freedoms would not be permitted as for mothers many of them are for escorting their daughters to public places because they themselves like racketing  but how charlotte methinks you ask do these reflections on your own sex square with what you said above of the preference of women to men  how i will tell you the men who frequent those places are still more silly than we is it their interest to join in this almost universal dissipation and would the women crowd to market if there were not men  we are entered into our new house it is furnished in taste lord g has wanted but very little of my correction i do assure you in the disposition of everything he begins to want employment have you harriet anything to busy him in  i am not willing to teach him to knot poor man he has already knit one that he cannot unty  god bless the honest soul he came to me just now so prim and so pleased  a parrot and paroquet  the parrot is the finest talker he had great difficulty he said in getting them he had observed that i was much taken with lady finlays parrot lady finlay had a marmouset too i wonder the poor man did not bring me a monkey o but you will say that was needless  you are very smart harriet upon my man i will not allow anybody but myself to abuse him  intolerable levity charlotte  and so it is but to whom only to you i love the man better every day than the former when i write of him thus saucily it is in the gaiety of my heart but if instead of a smile i have drawn upon myself your contempt what a mortification however deserved will that be to  your charlotte g  letter xxii miss byron to lady g selbyhouse friday june    you write my dear lady g with intent to make me smile i thank you for your intention it is not wholly lost my friends and i are one and my uncle and cousin james laughed out at several places in your lively letter lucy nancy smiled my cousins kitty and patty holles said you were a charming lady but shall i tell you what my grandmamma and aunt said  i will not  now will your curiosity be excited  to say the truth they spoke not they only shook their heads i saw my dear greatly as they love and admire you that if they had smiled it would have been at not with the poor charlotte let me pity you my dear who in some places of her letter could sport with the infirmities of age to which we are all advancing and even wish to arrive at and in others treat lightly a man to whom she owes respect and has vowed duty and who almost adores her  you ask my dear which of a certain pair has most understanding and you bid me not mortify you with giving it on the mans side i will not lord g is far from being wanting in understanding but lady g has undoubtedly more than thousands even of sensible women but in her treatment of certain subjects she by no means shows it there is for you my dear i hope you will be angry with your harriet you ought to take one of us to task methinks i would not have you be angry with yourself  but my dear i am not well this therefore may make me the less capable of relishing your raillery these men vex me grevilles obstinate perseverance and so near a neighbor that i cannot avoid seeing him often poor mr ormes ill health another letter from sir rowland meredith its contents so extremely kind and generous that they afflict me  lady d urging me i am afraid i must say with such strength of reason and with an affection so truly maternal that i know not how to answer her and just now i have received a letter unknown to that good lady from the earl of d  laying in a claim on a certain supposition that  o my dear how cruel is all this to your harriet my grandmamma by her eyes i see wishes me to think of marriage and with lord d  as all thoughts  i need not say of what are over  my aunt selbys eyes are ready to second my grandmammas  my uncle speaks out on the same side of the question so do you so does lucy nancy is silent she sees my disturbance when i am looked at and talked to on this subject so ought lucy i think sir rowland says mr fowler has almost pined himself to death  my soul my dear is fretted i have begged leave to pass a fortnight or three weeks with my good mr deane who rejoiced at the motion but my grandmother heard my request with tears she could not spare her harriet she told me my aunt also dried her eyes  how my charlotte could i think of leaving them  yet could they have parted with me i should surely have been more composed with mr deane than at present i can be anywhere else he is more delicate shall i be excused to say than my uncle  were but the news come that the solemnity is over  i am greatly mistaken in myself if i should not be more easy than i am at present  but then i should be more teazed more importuned than before you tell me the countess of d would come down the very thought of that visit hurts me  i have no doubt but by this time the knot is tied god almighty shower on the heads of both the choicest of his blessings i should be quite out of humor with myself if i were not able to offer up this prayer as often as i pray for myself  i beg of you my dear to speed to me the next letters from italy be the contents what they will you know i am armed shall the event i wish to be over either surprise or grieve me i hope not  i will not pity lady olivia because she threatened and raved true love rages not threatens not yet a disappointment in love is a dreadful thing and may operate in different minds different ways as i have read somewhere  i shall write to all my friends in town and at colnebrooke i trouble you not therefore with particular compliments to them  how could you mention the names of mr and mrs reeves and say no more of them i thought you loved them both they are deserving of your love and love you  never i believe did any young creature suffer in her mind by suspense as i have done for some months past in the present situation of things i know not what further to write what can i my charlotte  conjectural topics are reserved for my closet and pillow  adieu and adieu my beloved friend my dear lady g be good and he happy what a blessing that both are in your power may they ever be so and may you make a good use of that power prays  your harriet byron  letter xxiii sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna june     my heart is unusually sad how imperfect is that happiness which we cannot enjoy without giving pain to another the count of belvedere has been made acquainted with the hopeful turn in the mind of clementina and that in all probability she will be given as a reward to the man to whose friendly cares for her and her brother the whole family attribute the happy alteration and late last night he gave me notice of his arrival in this city and of his intention to pay me an early visit this morning  i have just now had a message from clementina by camilla with a request that i will suspend my intended visit till the afternoon  i asked camilla if she knew the reason of this and of her being so early dispatched with it she said it was her young ladys own order without consulting anybody the marchioness said she yesterday in the afternoon told her that everything was now absolutely determined upon between them and me and she would be mistress of her own wishes and that i should be allowed to attend her in the morning at breakfast to know what those were her young lady on this happy communication so camilla called it threw herself at her mothers feet and in a very graceful manner acknowleged her fathers and her indulgence to her and from that hour her temper took a turn different from what it had been before for ever since said camilla she has been silent solemn and reserved yet busy at her pen transcribing fair from her pocketbook what she had written in it tomorrow camilla  tomorrow said she breaking once her solemn silence her complexion varying will be a day indeed o that it were come and yet i dread it how shall i face to face converse with this exalted man what shall i do to appear as great as he his goodness fires me with emulation  o that tomorrow were come and gone  this was over night i believe proceeded camilla that the dear lady is drawing up some conditions of her own for you to sign but sir i dare say by the hint she has thrown out they will be generous ones and what will have more of fancy than hardship in them  i had much ado to prevail upon her continued her faithful woman to go to rest at midnight yet at four in the morning she arose and went to her pen and ink and about six commanded me to call laura to attend her while i went to you with the message i have brought i expostulated with her and begged she would delay it till the marchioness arose but she began to be impatient i have reason in my request camilla said she i must not be contradicted or expostulated with my head will not bear opposition at this time is it a slight thing for such a poor creature as i have been and am to be put out of her course am i not to have a meeting with the chevalier grandison on the most important act of my life my mamma tells me that i am to be now mistress of my own will dont you camilla seek to control me i shall not be prepared enough for the subject he will possibly talk to me upon till the afternoon and if i know he is in the house with an expectation of seeing me i shall want the presence of mind i am struggling to obtain  so sir concluded camilla i have performed my duty the dear lady i see will be in too much confusion if the important subject be not begun with precaution but who shall instruct you in such delicate points as these one thing however permit me sir to observe i have often known young ladies go on courageously with a lover while the end in view has been distant or there have been difficulties to encounter with but when these difficulties are overcome and they have ascended the hill they toiled up they have turned round and looked about them with fear as strong as their hopes  what the conditions may be   but the count of belvedere is come  ten oclock the count accosted me in return for the kindest reception i could give him with an air of coldness and displeasure i was surprised at a behavior so different from his usual politeness and the kindness he had ever shown me i took notice to him of it he asked me if i would tell him faithfully what my present situation was with lady clementina  i will my lord if i tell you anything of it but the temper of mind you seem to be in may not perhaps for your own sake any more than mine make it prudent for me to comply with your expectations  you need not give me any other answer replied he you seem to be sure of the lady but she must not she shall not be yours while i am living  it is not for me my lord who have met with many amazing turns and incidents which i have not either invited or provoked to be surprised at anything but if your lordship has any expectations any demands to make on this subject it must be from the family of the marchese della porretta and not from me  do you think sir that i feel not the sting of this reference and yet all the family but one are in my interest in their hearts every consideration is on my side not one but the plausibility of your generosity and the speciousness of your person and manners on yours  a man my lord should not be reproached for qualities upon which whether he has them or not he values not himself but let me ask you were my pretensions out of the question has your lordship any hope of an interest in the affections of lady clementina  while she is unmarried i may hope had you not come over to us i make no doubt but i might in time have called her mine you cannot but know that her absence of mind was no obstacle with me  i am wholly satisfied in my own conduct replied i that my lord is a great point with me i am not accountable for it to any man on earth yet if you have any doubts about it propose them i have a high opinion of the count of belvedere and wish to have him think well of me  tell me chevalier what your present situation is with lady clementina what is concluded upon between the family and you and whether clementina herself has declared for you  she has not yet declared herself to me i repeat that i have a value for the count of belvedere and will therefore acquaint him with more than he has reason to expect from the humor which seems to have governed him in this visit  i am to attend her this afternoon by appointment her family and i understand one another i have been willing to consider the natural impulses of a spirit so pure though disturbed as the finger of providence i have hitherto been absolutely passive in honor i cannot now be so this afternoon my lord   this afternoon trembling what this afternoon   will my destiny as to lady clementina be determined  i am distracted if her friends are determined in your favor it is from necessity rather than choice but if the lady is left to her own determination i am a lost man  you have given a reason my lord for your acquiescence should lady clementina determine in my favor  but it cannot be a happy circumstance for me if as you hint i am to enter into the family of porretta as an unwelcome relation to any of them and still less if my good fortune shall make a man justly valued by all who know him unhappy  and are you this afternoon chevalier to see clementina for the purpose you intimate this very afternoon  and are you then to change your passive conduct toward her and will you court will you urge her to consent to be yours religion country  let me tell you sir  i must take resolutions with infinite regret i tell you that i must you will not refuse to meet me the consent is not yet given you shall not rob italy of such a prize favor me sir this moment without the citygates  unhappy man how much i pity you you know my principles it is hard acting as i have done to be thus invited acquaint yourself with my whole conduct in this affair from the bishop from father marescotti from the general himself so much always your friend and once so little mine what has influenced them so much as you seem to think against their inclinations cannot want its influence upon a mind so noble as that of the count of belvedere but whatever be your resolutions upon the enquiries i wish you to make i tell you beforehand that i never will meet you but as my friend  he turned from me with emotion he walked about the room as a man irresolute and at last with a wildness in his air approached me  i will go this instant said he to the family i will see father marescotti and the bishop and i will let them know my despair and if i cannot have hope given me  o chevalier once more i say that lady clementina shall not be yours while i live  he looked round him as if he would not have anybody hear what he was going to say but me though no one was near and whispering it is better said he to die by your hand than  he stopped and in disorder hurried from me and was out of sight when i got down to the door  the count when he came up to me left his valet below who told saunders that lady sforza had made his lord a visit at parma and by something she related to him had stimulated him to make this to me he added that he was very apprehensive of the humor he came in and which he had held ever since he saw lady sforza  how my dear dr bartlett do the rash escape as they do when i who endeavor to avoid embarrassments and am not ready either to give or take offense am hardly able to extricate myself from one difficulty but i find myself involved in another what cannot a woman do when she resolves to make mischief among friends lady sforza is a highspirited and contriving woman it is not for her interest that clementina should marry at all but yet as the count of belvedere is a cool a dispassionate man and knows the views of that lady i cannot but wonder what those arts must be by which she has been able to excite in so calm a breast a flame so vehement  i am now hastening to the palace of porretta my heart not a little affected with the apprehensions given me by camillas account of her young ladys solemn yet active turn on the expected visit for does it not indicate an imagination too much raised for the occasion important as that is and that her disorder is far from subsiding  letter xxiv sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna sat evening i sit down now my dear and reverend friend to write to you particulars which will surprise you clementina is the noblest woman on earth what at last  but i find i must have a quieter heart and fingers too before i can proceed  i think i am a little less agitated than i was the above few lines shall go for they will express to you the emotions of my mind when i attempted to write an account of what had then so newly passed  as soon as i entered the palace camilla met me and conducted me to the marchioness the marquis and the bishop were with her o chevalier said she we have been greatly disturbed by a visit from the count of belvedere poor man  he says he waited on you at your lodgings  he did i then at the bishops request told them all that had passed between us except his last words which implied that it was better to die by the hand of another man than by his own  they expressed their concern for him and their apprehensions for me but i found that his unexpected visit had not altered their purpose in my favor they were convinced they told him that the restoration of their daughters tranquillity of mind depended upon giving her entirely her own way and not one word more of opposition or contradiction should she meet with from them  i have been hindered said the marchioness by this unhappy mans visit and his vehemence which moved me to pity him for i am afraid that he will be in our daughters unhappy way from watching in person the humor of my child which two hours ago camilla told me was very particular i was going to her when you came but i will send for camilla  she did  as soon as she saw me in the morning continued the marchioness she apologized to me for sending camilla to you to suspend your visit till the afternoon she was not she said prepared to see you  i asked her continued she what preparation was wanted to see a man esteemed by us all and who had given such instances of his regard to her  madam answered she and seemed as if gasping for breath am i not now to see him in a light in which hitherto i never beheld him i have a thousand things to say to him none of which perhaps i shall be able to say except he draws them from me he hinted once very lately that he could only be rewarded by a family act we cannot reward him that is my grief i must see him with a heart overwhelmed with obligation he will appear as a prince to me i must to myself as his vassal i have been putting down in writing what i should say to him but i cannot please myself o madam he is great in my eyes because i am unable to reward him as he deserves i told her that her fortune her quality the sacrifice she would make of her country though never i hoped of her religion ought to give her a higher opinion of herself though all these were far from cancelling the obligation we all were under to him on our jeronymos account as well as on hers  well madam replied she heaven only knows how i shall be able to behave to him now you have left every thing to myself and how he will talk to me by permission on a subject so new yet so very interesting o that this day were over  i asked her proceeded the marchioness if she would yet take further time  a week or more  o no said she that must not be i shall be prepared to see him i hope by the afternoon pray let him come then i am very clear now putting her hand to her forehead i may not be so a week nor a day hence  camilla then entered the room camilla said the marchioness in what way is the dear creature now  ever since your ladyship left her she has been more reserved and thoughtful yet her spirits are high her mind seems full of the chevaliers next visit and twice within this halfhour she asked if he were come she reads over and over something she has written lays it down takes it up walks about the room sometimes with an air of dignity at others hanging down her head i dont like her frequent startings within this hour she has several times shed tears she sighs often she was not to be pleased with her dress once she would be in black then in colors then her white and silver was taken out but that she said would give her a bridal appearance she at last chose her plain white satin she looks like an angel but o that her eyes and her motions showed greater composure  you have a task before you chevalier said the bishop what tokens are these of a disordered yet a raised mind we may see from these extraordinary agitations on the expectation of a conversation that is to end in her consent to crown your wishes how much her heart has been in that event may it be happy to you both  i fear nothing said the marchioness as to the happiness of my child that lies within the power of the chevalier i am sure of his tenderness to her  i think said the marquis we will allow the chevalier to carry his bride over to england for the first six months and return with her to us in the second it may give a new turn to the course of her ideas the same places the same persons always in view may sadden her reflecting heart and besides the mind of the poor count of belvedere may be strengthened by this absence  the bishop applauded this thought the marchioness said reason may approve the motion but can the mother so soon part with her child  yet for her happiness i must submit  let us said the marquis leave this to her choice as the rest camilla let my daughter know that the chevalier attends her pleasure you would have it so chevalier  i bowed my assent  camilla returned not presently when she did i could not come sooner said she my young lady is strangely fluttered i have been reasoning with her  madam turning to the marchioness will you be pleased to walk up to her  had this been the first interview said the bishop i should not have wondered at her discomposure but this disorder shows itself in a strange variety of shapes  the marchioness attended by camilla went up i was soon sent for the marchioness met me at the entrance of the young ladys dressing room  and retiring whispered  i believe she had rather be alone with you dear creature i dont know what to make of her she has i fansy something to propose to you camilla come with me we will be but in the next room chevalier  when i entered the room the young lady was sitting in a pensive mood at her toilette her hand supporting her head a fine glow overspread her cheeks as soon as she saw me she arose and courtesying low advanced a few steps toward me but trembled and looked now down now aside and now consciously glancing toward me  i approached her and with profound respect took her hand with both mine and pressed it with my lips i address not myself now to lady clementina as my pupil i have leave given me to look upon her in a nearer light and she will have the goodness to pardon the freedom of this address  ah chevalier said she turning her face from me but not withdrawing her hand  and hesitating as if not knowing how to speak her mind sighed and was silent  i led her to her chair she sat down still trembling god be praised said i bowing my face on both her hands as i held them in mine for the amended health of the lady so dear to all who have the happiness of knowing her may her recovery and that of our dear jeronymo be perfected  happy man said she happy in the power given you to oblige as you have done  but how how shall i  o sir you know not the conflict that has rent my heart in pieces ever since  i forget when  o chevalier i have not power  she stopped wept and remained silent  it is in your power madam to make happy the man to whom you own obligations which are already overpaid  i took my seat by her at her silent motion to a chair  speak on sir my soul is laboring with great purposes tell me tell me all you have to say to me my heart is too big for its prison putting her hand to it it wants room methinks yet utterance is denied me  speak and let me be silent  your father mother brothers uncle are all of one mind i am permitted to open my heart to their clementina and i promise myself a gracious audience father marescotti befriends me  the terms madam are those i offered when i was last in italy  she hung down her head in listening silence   every other year i am to be happy with my clementina in england   your clementina sir  ah chevalier  she blushed and turned away her face  your clementina sir repeated she  and looked pleased yet a tear stole down on her glowing cheek  yes madam i am encouraged to hope you will be mine  you are to have your confessor madam father marescotti will do me the honor of attending you in that function his piety his zeal my own charity for all those who differ from me in opinion my honor so solemnly engaged to the family who condescend to entrust me with their dearest pledge will be your security  ah sir interrupted she and are not you then to be a catholic  you consented madam when i was last in italy that i should pursue the dictates of my conscience  did i said she and sighed  well sir   your father or mother madam will acquaint you with every other particular in which you shall want to be satisfied  tears stood in her eyes she seemed in great perplexity she would twice or thrice have spoken but speech was denied her at last she gave me her hand and directed her steps trembling to her closet she entered it leave me leave me said she and putting a paper in my hand and shutting to the door instantly as i saw fell on her knees and i to avoid hearing sobs which pierced my heart went into the next apartment where were her mother and camilla who had heard part of what had passed between us the marchioness went to her but presently returning the dear creature said she is quite sensible thank god though in grief she besought me to leave her to her own struggles if she could but be assured that you chevalier would forgive her she should be better she had given you a paper let him read it said she and let me stay here till he sends for me if he can bear in his sight after he has read it a creature unworthy of his goodness  what said the marchioness can be the meaning of all this  i was as much surprised as she i had not opened the paper and offered to read it in her presence but she desired to hear it read in her lords if it were proper and precipitately withdrew leaving me in the young ladys dressing room camilla attending in the next apartment to wait her commands i was astonished at the contents these are they translated by dr bartlett   o thou whom my heart best loves forgive me  forgive me said i for what  for acting if i am enabled to act greatly the example is from thee who in my eyes art the greatest of human creatures my duty calls upon me one way my heart resists my duty and tempts me not to perform it do thou o god support me in the arduous struggle let it not as once before overthrow my reason my but justreturning reason  o god do thou support me and strengthen my reason my effort is great it is worthy of the creature which thou clementina did always aspire to be  my tutor my brother my friend o most beloved and best of men seek me not in marriage i am unworthy of thee thy soul was ever most dear to clementina whenever i meditated the gracefulness of thy person i restrained my eye i checked my fancy and how why by meditating the superior graces of thy mind and is not that soul thought i to be saved dear obstinate and perverse and shall i bind my soul to a soul allied to perdition that so dearly loves that soul as hardly to wish to be separated from it in its future lot  o thou most amiable of men how can i be sure that were i thine thou would not draw me after thee by love by sweetness of manners by condescending goodness i who once thought a heretic the worst of beings have been already led by the amiableness of thy piety by the universality of thy charity to all thy fellow creatures to think more favorably of all heretics for thy sake of what force would be the admonitions of the most pious confessor were thy condescending goodness and sweet persuasion to be exerted to melt a heart wholly thine i know that i should not forbear arguing with thee in hopes to convince thee yet sensible of thy superior powers and of my duty might i not be entangled my confessor would in that case grow uneasy with me women love not to be suspected opposition arises from suspicion and contradiction thy love thy gentleness thrown in the other scale should i not be lost  and what have my father my mother my brothers done that i should show myself willing to leave them and a beloved country for a country but lately hated too as well as the religion but now that that hatred is gone off and so soon gives another instance of my weakness and thy strength o most amiable of men  o thou whom my soul loves seek not to entangle me by thy love were i to be thine my duty to thee would mislead me from that i owe to my god and make me more than temporarily unhappy since were thou to convince me at the time my doubts would return and whenever thou were absent i should be doubly miserable for can thou can i be indifferent in these high matters have thou not shown me that thou can not and shall i not be benefited by thy example shall a wrong religion have a force an efficacy upon thee which a right one cannot have upon me  o thou most amiable of men seek not to entangle me by thy love  but do thou indeed love me or is it owing to thy generosity thy compassion thy nobleness for a creature who aiming to be great like thee could not sustain the effort i call upon thee blessed virgin to witness how i formerly struggled with myself how much i endeavored to subdue that affection which i ever must bear to him  permit me most generous of men to subdue it it is in thy p were to hold me fast or to set me free i know thou love clementina it is her pride to think that thou do but she is not worthy of thee yet let thy heart own that thou love her soul her immortal soul and her future peace in that will thou show thy love as she has endeavored to show hers thou art all magnanimity thou can sustain the effort which she was unequal to make some other woman happy  but i cannot bear that it shall be an italian if it must be an italian not florence but bologna shall give an italian to thee  but can i show thee this paper which has cost me so many tears so much study so much blottingout and revising and transcribing and which yet i drew up with an intent to show thee i verily think i cannot nor will i till i can see by conversing with thee face to face what i shall be enabled to do in answer to prayers to heaven that it would enable me  o how faint at times have been those prayers  you my father my mother my brothers and you my spiritual father pious and good man have helped to subdue me by your generous goodness you have all yielded up your own judgments to mine you have told me that if the choice of my heart can make me happy happy i shall be but do i not know that you have complied with me for my sake only  shall i not if it please god to restore my memory be continually recollecting the arguments which you father marescotti in particular formerly urged against an alliance with this noblest of men because he was of a religion so contrary to my own and so pertinacious in it and will those recollections make me happy o permit permit me my dearest friends still to be gods child the spouse of my redeemer only let me let me yet take the veil  and let me in a place consecrated to his glory pass the remainder of my life it may not be a long one in prayers for you all and in prayers for the conversion and happiness of the man whose soul my soul loves and ever must love what is the portion of this world which my grandfathers have bequeathed to me weighed against this motive and my souls everlasting welfare let me take a great revenge of my cruel cousin laurana let hers be the estate so truly despised and so voluntarily forfeited by the happier clementina  are we not all of us rich and noble shall i not have a great revenge if i can be enabled to take it in this way  o thou whom my soul loves let me try the greatness of thy love and the greatness of thy soul by thy endeavors to strengthen and not impair a resolution which after all it will be in thy power to make me break or keep for god only knows what this struggle from the first has cost me and what it will still further cost me but my brain wounded my health impaired can i expect a long life and shall i not endeavor to make the close of it happy let me be great my chevalier how fondly can i nevertheless call thee my chevalier thou cast make the unhappy clemantina what thou please  but o my friends what can we do for this great and good man in return for the obligations he has heaped upon us all in return for his goodness to two of your children these obligations lie heavy upon my heart yet who knows not his magnanimity who that knows him knows not that he can enjoy the reward in the action divine almost divine philanthropist can thou forgive me  but i know thou can thou have the same notions that i have of the brevity and vanity of this worlds glory and of the duration of that to come and can i have the presumption to imagine that the giving thee in marriage so wounded a frame would be making thee happy once more if i have the courage the resolution to show thee this paper do thou enable me by thy great example to complete the conquest of myself and do not put me upon taking advantage of my honored friends generosity but do god and thou enable me to say not my will but his and theirs be done  yet after all it must be let me own in thy choice for i cannot bear to be thought ungrateful to such exalted merit to add what name thou please to that of  clementina    never was man more astonished perplexed confounded for a few moments i forgot that the angel was in her closet expecting the issue of my contemplations and walking out of her dressing room i threw myself on a soffa in the next room not heeding camilla who sat in the window my mind tortured how greatly tortured yet filled with admiration of the angelic qualities of clementina i tried to look again into the paper but the contents were all in my mind and filled it  she rang camilla hastened to her i started as she passed me i arose yet trembled and for a moment sat down to reassure my feet but camilla coming to me roused me out of the stupidity that had seized me never was i so little present to myself as on this occasion  a woman so superior to all her own sex and to all that i had read of of ours  o sir said camilla my lady dreads your anger she dreads to see you yet hopes it  hasten hasten and save her from fainting  o how she loves you how she fears your displeasure  hers indeed is true love  she said this as she conducted me in as i now recollect for then all my faculties were too much engaged to attend to her  i hastened in the admirable lady met me halfway and throwing herself at my feet  forgive me forgive the creature who must be miserable if you are offended with her  i would have raised her but she would not be raised she said till i had forgiven her  i kneeled to her as she kneeled and clasping her in my arms forgive you madam inimitable woman more than woman  can you forgive me for having presumed or for still persuming to hope such an angel mine  she was ready to faint and cast her arms about me to support herself camilla held to her her salts  i myself for the first time was sensible of benefit from them as my cheek was joined to hers and bathed with her tears  am i am i forgiven  say that i am   forgive madam you have done nothing that requires forgiveness i adore your greatness of mind  what you wish bid me be and that i will be rise most excellent of human creatures  i raised her and leading her to a chair involuntarily kneeled on one knee to her holding both her hands in mine as she sat and looking up to her with eyes that spoke not my heart if they were not full of love and reverence  camilla had run down to the marchioness  o madam it seems she said  such a scene hasten hasten up they will faint in each others arms virtuous love how great is thy glory  the marquis his lady the bishop the count and father marescotti were together waiting the event of my visit they were surprised at camillas address  but little imagined to what the intellectual scene she spoke of was owing  the marchioness hastened after camilla and found me in this kneeling posture her daughters hands both in mine  dear chevalier said she restrain your grateful rapture for the sake of the sweet childs head grateful as i see by her eyes it must be to her  restrain it  o madam quitting clementinas hands and rising and taking one of hers  glory in your daughter you always loved and admired her but you will now glory in her she is an angle  give me leave madam to clementina to present this paper to the marchioness i give it to her  read it madam  let your lord let the bishop let father marescotti read it  but read it with compassion for me and then direct me what to say what to do i resign myself wholly to your direction and theirs and to yours my dear lady clementina  you say you forgive me chevalier  now shall i forgive myself gods goodness and yours will i hope perfectly restore me this is my direction chevalier  love my mind as yours ever was the principal object of my love  what what my dear can be in this paper said the marchioness holding it in her hand trembling and afraid to open it pardon me madam answered clementina  i could not show it to you first i could not reveal my purpose to camilla neither how could i when i knew not whether i could or could not maintain it or even mention it  but now best of men and rising laid her hand on my arm leave me for a few moments my heart is disturbed be so good as to excuse me madam  she again retired to her closet we heard her sob and camilla hastening to her  o these hysterical disorders said she  they tear her tender constitution in pieces  the marchioness left her to camilla and offered me her hand surprising said she as we went where will all this end what can be in this paper  i was unable to answer and coming to the passage that led to her drawing room where she had left the gentlemen i bowed on her hand and the same passage leading to the backstairs took that way into the garden in order to try to recover and compose my spirits  who my dear friend could have expected such a turn as this  i had not walked long before mr lowther came to me  signor jeronymo sir said he is greatly disturbed on reading a paper that has been put into his hands he begs to see you instantly  mr lowther left me at jeronymos chamber door he was on his couch o my grandison said he as i approached him with a thoughtful air how much am i concerned for you i cannot bear that such a spirit as yours should be subjected to the petulance of a brainsick girl  hush my jeronymo let not the friend forget the brother clementina is the noblest of women it is true i was not prepared for this blow but i reverence her for her greatness of mind  you have read her paper  i have and am astonished at its contents  the marquis the count the bishop and father marescotti entered the bishop embraced me he disclaimed in the name of every one the knowledge of her intentions he expected he said that she would have received my address with raptures of joy but she must she will be yours chevalier we are all engaged in honor to you this is only a start of female delicacy operating on a raised imagination she leaves it to you after all to call her by what name you please  may it be so but ah my lords you see not the force of her arguments with a lady so zealous in her religion and so justly fond of her relations and country they must have weight  instruct me tell me however my lords be pleased madam the marchioness joined us just before to advise me what to do  i am yours  i will withdraw consult together and let me know what i am to be  i withdrew and walked again into the garden  camilla came to me o chevalier what strange things are these my lady has taken a resolution she never will be able to support she commanded me to find you out and to watch your looks your behavior your temper she cannot live she says if you are displeased with her  i see that your mind is greatly disturbed must i report it so  tell her camilla that i am all resignation to her will disturbed as she has been tell her that her peace of mind is dear to me as my own life that i can have no anger no resentment and that i admire her more than i can express  camilla left me father marescotti came to me presently after with a request that i would attend the family in jeronymos chamber  we went up together all that the good father said as we walked in was that god knew what was best for us for his part he could only wonder and adore in silence  when we were all seated the bishop said my dear chevalier you have entitled yourself to our utmost gratitude it is confirmed that clementina shall be yours jeronymo will have it so we are all of his mind her mother will enter into conversation with her in your favor  i am equally obliged and honored by this goodness but should she persist what can i say when she calls upon me in the most solemn manner to support her in her resolution and not to put her upon taking advantage of the generosity of her friends  she will be easily persuaded no doubt chevalier answered the bishop she loves you does she not say in this very paper that it is in your power to make her break or keep her resolution and to add what name you please to her christian name  nor can i said the marquis bear that flight in lauranas favor if her mind were found her duty would not permit her to think of it  it is our unanimous opinion resumed the bishop that she will not be able to support her resolution you see she is obliged to court your assistance to enable her to keep it father marescotti it is true has laid a stress upon some passages in which she shows a doubt of her own strength and dreads yours in a certain article nearest our hearts but she must be cautioned to leave all arguments of that kind to her confessor and you and to content herself to be an auditor not an arguer and we doubt not your honor the marriagearticles will bind you as they shall us  and now allow me to be beforehand with your jeronymo and ours in saluting you our brother  he took my hand and embracing me as such you deal nobly with me my lord said i i resign myself to your direction  jeronymo affectionately held out his arms and joyfully saluted me as his brother the marquis the count each took my hand and the marchioness offering hers i pressed it with my lips and withdrawing hastened to my lodgings with a heart o dr bartlett how penetrated by a suspense so strange and unexpected  but when they attribute to flight and unsoundness of mind that glorious passage in which she proposes to take a revenge so noble on the cruel laurana they seem unable to comprehend as i can easily do the greatness of mind of this admirable woman  letter xxv sir charles grandison in continuation bologna monday july  0     i had no call for rest last night i only reposed myself in a chair for about an hour i sent early in the morning a note to enquire with the tenderest solicitude after all their healths and particularly clementinas and jeronymos a written answer was returned by jeronymo that his sister had rested so very ill that it was thought advisable to keep her quiet all day unless she should be particularly earnest to see me and in that case they would send me word  i was myself very much indisposed yet had a difficulty to deny myself though uninvited to attend them at dinner my own disorder however determined me not to go unless sent for it would i thought be too visible to them all and might raise a suspicion that i wanted to move compassion a meanness of which i am not capable yet indisposed as i was still more in the afternoon i hoped to have an invitation for half an hour but not being sent to i repeated my enquiries in another billet no invitation followed on the contrary jeronymo wrote one line wishing to see me in the morning  i had as little rest last night as the night before my impatience carried me to the palace of porretta sooner than usual this morning  signor jeronymo rejoiced to see me he hoped i did not take amiss that they invited me not the day before to say the truth said he the days rest was judged entirely necessary for you both for my sister particularly and she was so uneasy and displeased at your going away on saturday without taking leave of her that she was the more easily persuaded not to see you yesterday but already this morning i understand she asks after you with impatience you are angry at her she supposes and will never see her more you had but just left us on saturday night when camilla came down with her request to see you for my part proceeded he my thoughts are so much carried out of myself by the extraordinary turn she has taken that at times i forget i ail anything  he then asked if i could forgive his sister and reflected on the sex on her account as never knowing their own minds but when they meet with obstacles to their wills but she must she will be yours my grandison said he and if it please god to restore her she will make you rich amends  the bishop and father marescotti came in to make their morning compliments to jeronymo the marquis and count entered soon after to salute me  the marchioness followed them clementina was so uneasy on saturday night said she to me on finding you gone without taking leave of her and so much discomposed all day yesterday that i chose not to say anything to her on the great article i am glad you are come  somebody just then tapping at the door come in camilla said the marchioness  it is not camilla it is i said lady clementina entering i am told the chevalier  o there he is  favor me sir with a few words  walking to a window at the other end of the room  i followed her tears were in her eyes she looked earnestly at me then turning her face from me  why madam said i taking her hand why this emotion i have not i hope offended you  o chevalier i cannot bear to be slighted and least of all by you though i must own that i deserve it most from you a slight from you is a charge of ingratitude upon me that my heart cannot bear  slight you madam  i revere you as the most excellent of women you have indeed filled my heart with anguish but i admire you more for the cause of that anguish than it is possible for me to express  dont dont say so you will ruin me by your generosity i think you must be angry with me i think you must treat me ill or how shall i keep my purpose  your purpose dearest madam  your purpose  my purpose yes sir will it afflict you if i do  is it possible madam but it must what would you think   hush hush my good chevalier i am afraid it will but dont tell me it will i cannot bear to afflict you  when i had the honor of every ones consent madam   that was in compassion to me sir  my dearest love said the marquis coming to us that was at first our motive but now an alliance with the chevalier grandison in justice to his merits is become our choice  i bowed to the generous nobleman she kneeled best and most indulgent of fathers taking his hand and kissing it let me thank you for bearing with me as you have done what trouble have i given you  all the business of my future life shall be to show my gratitude and my obedience to your will the marchioness then tenderly raising her took her to the farther end of the room they talked low but we heard all they said you were so very indifferent all day yesterday and last night said the marchioness that i would not disturb you love for fear of breaking your rest else i would have told you how desirous now we all are of an alliance with the chevalier grandison no other way can he be rewarded for his goodness to us all  permit me madam answered clementina to give you the motives of my present conduct of my selfdenial such is my value for the chevalier i will call it so if i thought i could make the generous man happy if i thought i should not rather punish than reward him if i thought i could be happy in myself and my soul would not be endangered if i thought i could make you and my papa happy by giving my hand to him god knows that my heart would not make the least scruple but madam the almighty has laid his hand upon me my head is not yet as it should be and before i took my resolution i considered everything as much as my poor shattered reason would permit me to consider it this was the way i took  i prayed that god would direct me i put myself in the situation of another person who circumstanced as i was i supposed came to me for advice i saw plainly that i could not deserve the chevalier because i could not think as he thought in the most important of all articles and there was no likelihood of his thinking as i thought i prayed for fortitude i doubted myself i altered and altered what i had written but still all my alterations ran one way it was against my own wishes so this i took for an answer to my prayers i transcribed it fair but still i doubted myself i would not consult you madam you had declared for the chevalier that would not have been to do justice to the question before me and to the divine impulse by which i was determined to be governed if my prayers for it should be answered i let not camilla know my struggles i besought the assistance of the blessed virgin to favor an unhappy maid whose heart was in her duty but whose head was disturbed it was suggested to me what to do yet i would not send to the chevalier what i had written i still doubted my heart and thought i never should be able to give him the paper at last i resolved but when he came my heart recoiled he could not but see the distress i was in i am sure i met with his pity could i but give him the paper thought i my difficulty would be over for then i am sure almost sure that seeing my scruples and the rectitude of my purpose he will himself generously support me in my resolution at last i gave the paper to him and now let me say that i verily think i shall be easier in my mind if i can be allowed to adhere to the contents yet not be thought ungrateful dear blessed grandison turning to me read once more that paper and then if you will not if you cannot set me free i will obey my friends and make you as happy as i can  she turned from every one and fell upon her knees great god i thank thee said she for this serene moment  serene as the noble enthusiast thought her mind i saw it was too high set from the turn of her eyes i feared a relapse it was owing to her greatness of mind her reason and her love combating with each other that she ever was disordered i approached her  admirable lady said i be you free whatever be my destiny be you for me what you wish to be if you are well and happy i will if possible make myself so  dear grandison said the bishop coming up to me and taking my hand how do i admire you but can you be thus great  shall i not emulate my lord such an example set by a woman i came over without any interested views i considered myself indeed as bound by the conditions to which i had formerly yielded but lady clementina and your family as free when i was encouraged to hope i did hope i will now though with deep regret go back to my former situation if lady clementina persists in her present resolution i will endeavor to acquiesce with it if she should change her mind i will hold myself in readiness to receive her hand as the greatest blessing that can be conferred upon me only let me add that in the first case the difficulty upon me will be greatly increased by the exalted contents of the paper she put into my hands on saturday  the marchioness taking her daughters hand and mine  why why said she should minds thus paired be sunderd  and will you chevalier wait with patience the result of my sweet childs  caprice  shall i call it  detain not my hand my dear mamma withdrawing it a little wildly  let me go up and pray that my fortitude of mind after the pain it has cost me to obtain it may not forsake me adieu adieu chevalier i will pray for you as well as for myself never never in my devotions will we be separated  away flew the angel  she met camilla in the passage  dear camilla i have had an escape as far as i know my hand and the chevaliers hand each in one of my mammas  my resolution was in danger my mamma might have joined them you know and then i must have been his  jeronymo in silence but tears in his eyes attended to the scene between his sister and she he embraced me  dearest of men let me repeat my mothers question can you with patience wait the result of this dear girls caprice  i can i will  but i will talk to her myself said he  so said the marquis will we all  it will be right to do so added the count least she should repent when it is too late  but i believe said father marescotti the chevalier himself would not wish that lady clementina should be too vehemently urged she pleads her soul a strong plea a plea that should not be overruled i myself doubt very much whether she will be able to adhere to her resolution if she be she will merit beatification but let her not be overpersuaded once more i should be glad to read the paper the contents of which have so much surprised us all  i had it in my pocket and he asked permission to read it aloud jeronymo opposed his motion but the bishop approving it he read it he laid great emphasis upon particular words and repeated several of the passages in it you will easily guess which my dear friend and all were as much affected they owned as when they heard it first read yet they joined in one doubt notwithstanding what she had so lately said of the deliberation she had given her purpose that she would not be able to adhere to her resolution and made me many compliments on the occasion  but my dear friend if she can continue to interest her glory in the adherence and they are not very urgent with her in my favor i am inclined to believe that she has greatness of mind sufficient to enable her to carry her resolution into effect where piety my dear friend engages the heart to give up its first fervors to its superior duties is it not probable that all temporal impulses should receive abatement and become but secondary ones and now will not father marescotti once more try to revive his influences over her mind  is it not his duty to do so zealous catholic as he is can the bishop refuse good man as he is and as steady in his principles to second the father  but what trials are these my dear dr bartlett to an expecting heart  will they not serve to convince us of the vanity of all human reliance for happiness i am in a very serious humor but what can i say to you on such subjects that you knew not much better before than i let us i remember you once said when we are called upon to act a great or manly part preach by action words then will be needless god only knows whether the ardent heart would be punished or rewarded by the completion of its wishes but this i know that were clementina to give me both her hand and her heart and could not by reason of religious doubts be happy with me i should myself be extremely miserable especially if i had been earnest to prevail upon her to favor me against her judgment  letter xxvi sir charles grandison in continuation i was obliged to lay down my pen my mind was too much disturbed to write on  we had a great deal of discourse before we quitted jeronymos chamber on this extraordinary subject they all as i told you expressed their doubts that the lady would be able to persist in her new resolution the marquis and marchioness gave their opinion that she should be left entirely to the workings of her own will and the count proposed by way of enforcing their opinions that neither the bishop and father marescotti on one hand though religion was in the question nor jeronymo and myself on the other should endeavor to prevail upon her either to alter or persevere in her way of thinking jeronymo said he desired only one conversation with his sister alone before he complied with this proposal  they put it to me i said that several passages in her paper were of too solemn a nature for me to refuse my consent to their proposal but however if i should observe in future conversations between her and me that she was inclined to alter her mind and seemed to wish to be encouraged to declare the alteration they must allow me for the sake of my own honor as a man and of her delicacy as a woman to show the ardour of my attachment to her by my preventing declaration and even entreaty  the marchioness bowed to me with a grateful smile of approbation  father marescotti hesitated as if he had something of an objection to make but he was silenced by the marquiss saying on your honor on your delicacy i am sure chevalier we may rely  i am absolutely of opinion that we may said the count the chevalier can put himself in every ones situation and can forget his own interest when a right and just measure is to be taken  this is true said jeronymo  but let it be our part to show the chevalier that he is not the only man in the world who can do so  you must remember my dear jeronymo said the bishop that religion is a consideration superior to all others shall our sister who follows the example set her by the chevalier he discouraged in an effort so noble but i am willing to subscribe to the proposal as an equal one  father marescotti said i you must return me the paper i must often have recourse to it to strengthen my own mind in order to enable myself to answer your expectations  the father desired leave to take a copy of it in shorthand and retired for that purpose  i have no doubt but he will make great use of it with the family and perhaps with the lady should there be occasion hereafter for my own part if the noble enthusiast when the heat of her imagination is gone off shall persist in believing that she has a divine impulse in favor of her resolution and that given in answer to her prayers i will endeavor to show her that her call upon me to support her in it though against myself shall be answered whatever it cost me  they prevailed on me to stay dinner she excused herself from being present but desired to see me when it was over  camilla then led me to her i found her in tears she was afraid she said that i would not forgive her yet i would she was sure if i knew the conflicts with which her soul labored  i soothed her disturbed mind i told her that i desired her direction and was resolved to pursue it her paper should be one of my constant lessons and her conscience the rule of my conduct with regard to my expectations of her favor  o sir said she how good you are it is from your generosity next to the divine assistance that i expect support in my resolution i but imperfectly remember what i would have done and what i consented to when you were last among us  but when i best knew myself i was more inclined to support my parents and brothers in their expectations with regard to the two great articles of religion and residence than to comply with yours my fortune my rank merited your consideration and my pride was sometimes piqued but it was the regard that i had to the welfare of your immortal soul that weighed most with me o sir could you have been a catholic   she then wrung her clasped hands and tears trickled down her cheeks god almighty convert you chevalier  but you must leave me i am beginning to be again unhappy  leave me sir but let me see you tomorrow i will pray for a composure of mind in the mean time do you pray for me too and pray for yourself chevalier the welfare of your soul your immortal soul was ever my principal concern  she began to ramble her looks were a little wild i took leave of her and going hastily from her in order to hide my own emotion i surprised father marescotti who as it was at first sight evident to me from the confusion i found him in and the attempts he hesitatingly made to excuse himself had been listening to what passed between the lady and me pity that a wellintended zeal should make a good man do mean things  no apologies my dear father said i if you doubted my honor i can think myself in some measure obliged to your condescension for taking this method to prove me allow me my dear sir to say it is to father marescotti that the man who in the greater actions of his life thinks himself under the allseeing eye will not be afraid of a fellowcreatures ear  i beg a thousand pardons said he hesitating and in confusion but i will confess the truth i believed it was next to impossible that a young man whose love to one of the most excellent of women is not to be questioned should be able to keep the conditions prescribed to him and forbear to make use of the power she acknowleges he has over her affections  but forgive me chevalier  forgive yourself my dear father i do most heartily forgive you  i led him down to jeronymos chamber begging of him not to say a syllable more of this matter and not to let me suffer in his esteem by this accident  i have more than once dr bartlett experienced the irreconcilable enmity of a man whom i have forgiven for a meanness and who was less able to forgive me my forgiveness than i was him his fault but father marescotti cannot be such a man he is capable of generous shame he could hardly hold up his head all the time i staid  i related to the family in the presence of the father the substance of what passed between the lady and me they seemed surprised at her stedfastness the bishop told me that he had dispatched a messenger post to the general with a letter in which he had written a faithful account of their present situation he would show me a copy of it if i pleased i was sure i said i could depend upon his generosity and honor and should be glad to know the sentiments of the general and his lady upon it when they returned an answer  i promised to attend them in the morning and going to my lodgings found there waiting for me the count of belvedere saunders and his gentleman were both together belowstairs waiting for yet dreading as they said my return saunders had told the count it was uncertain but he declared that he would wait for me were it ever so late they both besought me to take care of my own safety his gentleman told me that his master had been very much disturbed in his mind ever since he was with me last declaring often that his life was a burden to him he believed he said he had a brace of pistols with him and then again expressed his care for my safety as well as his lords fear not said i the count is a man of honor i would not for the world hurt him and i dare say he will not hurt me  i hastened up why my lord said i taking his unwilling hands each in mine for a double reason did you not let me know you intended me this honor or why did not your lordship send for me as soon as you came  send for you with a melancholy air what from your clementina no  but tell me what is concluded upon my soul is impatient to know answer me like a man answer me like a man of honor  nothing my lord is concluded upon nothing can be concluded upon till lady clementinas mind be fully known  if that be all the obstacle   not a slight one i assure you that clementina knows her own worth she will put a just value upon herself in her unhappy delirium she always preserved a high sense of that delicacy which distinguishes the woman of true honor it shines forth now in all her words and actions with redoubled luster she will make the more difficulties as her friends make less nothing can be done soon and if it will make your lordship easier for i see you are disturbed i will acquaint you when anything is likely to be carried into effect  and is nothing yet concluded on and will you give me such notice  i will my lord  upon your honor  upon my honor  well then i have some days longer to crawl upon this earth  what means my lord  this i mean withdrawing his hands from mine and taking out of his pockets two pistols i came resolved that you should take one of these at your choice had the affair been concluded upon as i dreaded it would i am no assassn sir nor ever employed one nor would i have deprived clementina of her elected husband all i intended was that the hand to which she is to give hers should have first taken my life i will not i cannot live to see her the wife of any man on earth though she has refused to be mine  you should have found i would not  what a rashness  but i see your mind is disturbed the count of belvedere could not otherwise talk in this manner  it is not impossible surely my dear dr bartlett however improbable as i begin to apprehend that clementina may change her mind i could not therefore acquaint the count with our present situation because the hope he would have conceived from it would in case of a change have added strength to his despair i contented myself therefore to reason with him on his rash intention and having renewed my assurances as above he took leave of me so much recovered as to thank me for the advice i had given him and to promise that he would make it the foundation of his prayers to heaven for a calmer mind than he had known for some days past  saunders and his valet seemed overjoyed at seeing us come down together in an amicable manner and in the high civility each paid the other  i should have mentioned that the count of his own accord in passing through my antechamber to the stairs laid in one of the windows the two pistols my dear grandison said he let these remain in your keeping they are pieces of curious workmanship whither might one of them by this time have sent me  and in what difficulties might you the survivor a foreigner have been involved which then i considered not for all my malice was levelled against my unhappy self i will not trust myself with them   here i conclude for this night i will not dispatch these lastwritten letters till i see what tomorrow will produce my dear friend how grievous is suspense  perhaps i should have thought myself more obliged to bear it had i been thus entangled fettered suspended by my own fault  letter xxvii sir charles grandison in continuation i went according to promise in the morning to the palace of porretta i found all the family the marchioness and lady clementina excepted in jeronymos chamber my entrance i suppose was solemn for jeronymo as i approached him snatching my hand said this girl this capricious this uncommon girl how can i forgive her for vexing the heart of my grandison  father marescotti looked so conscious that i pitied him i took his hand and with an air of kindness asked him  are there any hopes my good father that i shall have the honor of calling you one of my dearest household friends in england  i gave him no time to answer lest he should not be assured enough and addressing myself to the bishop my lord i ask you the like question is there a likelihood that i shall have an interest in father marescottis more intimate friendship we already i answer for myself and from my vanity love each other  dear grandison said the marquis and taking my hand he called me by the kindest name  saving that it was not son jeronymo dried his eyes the count saluted me in a tender accent the bishop was silent  i see thought i that the admirable clementina perseveres  religion that can do so much for her will not i hope leave me unbenefited by its allchearing influence if i cannot be so happy as i wish i am in the hands of providence and will not give myself up to unmanly despair  yet the greatness of this womans mind thought i  why did they not fall upon indulgent methods with her before then probabl had there not been a supposed reason for an invitatin to me to quit my native country to which i had been so long a stranger and to come over to italy  then had she in all likelihood recovered her reason and i had not known how great she could be and her filial duty would have disengaged me equally from all obligations of honor and expectations of favor  the marchioness came in soon after her address to me confirmed me in my apprehensions  dear grandison said she condescendingly laying her hand on mine how do you see our dear jeronymo  how much better he is  what return can we make to you for your goodness to him i went up to the dear girl last night after you were gone she was then indeed a little hysterical but the disorder went off in prayers for you and for herself i am just come from her she has had a quiet night she is calm and i may say serene all her cares are in what manner to show her gratitude to you  it is impossible madam but i must have joy in your joy lady clementina i apprehend perseveres in her resolution   i have talked to her chevalier in your favor if you love her she says as we all think you do she will yet be yours  dear madam overjoyed tell me   let me interrupt you chevalier i must not mislead you nor keep you in suspense  she will she says beg your acceptance of her vows  if   if what madam   hear me with patience chevalier  if you will comply with the conditions on which we would have permited her to be yours when you were last in italy  this is her own proposal  made at her own motion  she is afraid it will be to no purpose she says afraid sir but as you have not denied her to herself she begs i will put the question to you in her name for the sake if you should refuse her of her own future tranquillity of mind the chevalier grandison is generous he is just he is polite he cannot but receive this motion of my child by her mother as the greatest condescension from both  i bowed i was going to speak but they all severally broke in upon me  on my knees chevalier said father marescotti i will entreat you  o chevalier said the bishop how happy is it in your power to make us all  surely you can you will you must chevalier said the count if you love the dear creature as we all suppose you do  you will not i hope dear grandison said the marquis refuse my daughter ask any conditions of us  she shall be with you in england in a months time we will accompany her thither and stay till you shall choose to return with us  jeronymo with sobs caught my hand as i sat next him  for gods sake for my sake for all our sakes for your souls sake my grandison be ours let your jeronymo call you brother  if my tears if my prayers have weight said the marchioness let me call down my child and she shall give you her hand in our presence she thinks besides the regard she has for your soul that she ought to insist upon the terms on which we would have consented to make her yours in gratitude for our compliance with her wishes  dearest grandison rejoined the bishop refuse not my sister refuse not the daughter of the marchese and marchesa della porretta refuse not the assenting clementina  they were all silent their eyes were upon me it is answered i too too condescendingly generous to put this task upon me but refuse lady clementina said you how you wound my soul by the supposition i see your compassion for me in the light you cannot but mean i should lady clementinas generously and condescendingly meant proposal when i am willing to allow terms to her that she will not to me shows me how important she thinks the difference between the two religions need i repeat my lord to the bishop what my own thoughts are upon this subject would to heaven the terms were no other than those before agreed to or were such as i could comply with i have only to console myself that the power of refusal lies where it ought to lie clementina is an angel i am not worthy of her yet let me add this company bowing round me cannot think me too solemn  were i to live always here were i convinced that there is no life after this your commands and clementinas would be laws to me but has she not the goodness to say in her paper that i have the same notion she has of the brevity and vanity of this worlds glory and of the duration of that to come  they looked upon one another it is hard very hard said the bishop for a man convinced of the truth of his religion to allow to another of a different persuasion what he expects should be allowed for himself you chevalier however can allow it and have greatness of mind enough to judge favorably of those who cannot i do love you but fain would i love you more  the marchioness wept my dear love said the marquis taking her hand with the tenderness of a lover but speaking a little too severely of me for his usual generosity  how many tears has this affair cost you my heart bleeds to see you weep comfort yourself let us comfort each other the chevalier grandison is indeed unworthy of our child unworthy of the terms we offered to him unworthy of our joint entreaties  he is an invincible man  i was greatly affected after a little hesitation i ask leave my lords said i to retire for one moment i will return as soon as i have recovered myself from the concern given me by the  misapprehension shall i call it of the best of men whom from my heart i reverence  i arose as i spoke withdrew and took two or three turns in the salon  i staid not till i was sent for but assuming as cheerful an air as i could returned and found them earnest in talk they all arose at my return seemingly pleased with it and the marquis coming to me chevalier said he i am sorry   not one word of apology my lord interrupted i i withdrew not from disrespect or in resentment but purely from concern that in your opinion i deserved not the honor done me by one so dear to you think me unhappy my lord and pity me principle not perverseness influences me it does every one present it does the dear lady above and shall we not allow for one another when we are all actuated by the same motive  o that i could embrace my fourth son said the marchioness the bishop threw his arms about me generous expansion of heart were the words that fell from his lips jeronymo showed his friendly love in what he said and must not said the count this young man be one of us  after chocolate the marchioness withdrew to the window making a motion to me to attend her i hastened to her she complimented me speaking low as a fit person to be consulted in a case where female delicacy was concerned and then asked me what i would have her say to clementina who had offered her hand to me on conditions with which she had hopes i would comply must i tell the dear child she is rejected  lady clementina rejected  dear madam how can i bear that she should but suppose it  be pleased to tell her that i have been again sounded on the subject of a change of religion if her favor for me could be procured but that i was so steady in my faith that there were no hopes of my conversion as you will call it and be so good as to remind her it may look like a breach of conditions if i do that i require not a change in her and that therefore the terms proposed are unequal  fain very fain chevalier would i  she stopped there  but no more on this subject i will see in what way the dear creature is now  she left me and went to her daughter the subject was changed  in about half an hour she returned she told me that she had followed my advice but that clementina seemed dissatisfied and perplexed and as she had not asked to see me advised me to suspend my attendance on her till the afternoon as she would by that means have more time to compose her spirits and herself further opportunities of talking with her  declining their invitation to dinner i went to my lodgings and to amuse myself had recourse to my pen  having written thus far i lay it down till my return from them  letter xxviii sir charles grandison in continuation at my entrance into the palace of porretta i was desired to walk into the garden to the bishop i found with him father marescotti  dear grandison said the bishop meeting me and taking my hand you must decide a point between the father and me that we are afraid has made us a little accountable to you  i was silent he proceeded  clementina is very sedate she sent for me and the father soon after you left us she asked us several questions in relation to you and insisted on our advice as religious men and as we would answer for it to our own consciences her first was whether we thought there were any hopes of your conversion  i answered negatively  i dont expect said she that he would be induced to change his religion for a wife nor even for a crown were he not convinced of the falsehood of his own and the truth of ours but again i ask cannot you and father marescotti convince his judgment i should think it would not be so hard a task learned and good men as you both are good man and modest and patient and unpresuming as he is who has been so long among catholics who came from england so young has been left so much to his own direction and who must see the difference of the two religions to the advantage of ours were he but to judge by the efficacy of each on the lives and manners of the people professing each for surely the men of name and family who are sent among us by their parents from the heretic countries in order to observe our manners and to improve their own are not the worst of the people of those countries  i told her proceeded the bishop that to be impartial there were bad and good of all nations that she was not likely to be approached by any of her own but who were good that you chevalier and mrs beaumont might convince us that there were good people among the protestants and that nowand then a young man of that profession did actually appear among us who was not a discredit to his country but continued i i have heretofore debated the subject with the chevalier grandison you know i was in a manner called upon to do it and have found him a protestant upon principle and that he has a great deal to say for himself you father would not allow me this but you never entered into close argument with him on the subject as i have done  my sister then asked proceeded the bishop if i thought that her own religious principles would be endangered if she became yours and went with you to england  we both referred her to certain passages in the paper she gave you  my heart said she could never be proof against a generous and kind treatment the condescending compliances with my weakness which my father mother brothers and uncle have made have effected what opposition and cruelty as you see could not so compassionate so humane a man as i think the chevalier grandison and so steady as he is in his principles so much as you own as he has to say for himself joined with the sense i always had from my mothers example of the duties of a good wife will too probably stagger me in my faith and if so i shall be unhappy i shall make my confessor so i am determined added she as you brother have seen in my own mind but i ask your opinion and yours father marescotti the chevalier now is a favorite with you both religion only can now be the question  is it not too probable that i shall be staggered in my own faith were i to be his  we gave her continued the bishop our opinions freely as religious men could we chevalier do otherwise and yet we are both ready to accuse ourselves of infringing conditions with you tell us if n your opinion we have  i cannot my lord judge from this general account if you did more than answer her questions if you expatiated argumentatively on the subject i must think you have and your own doubts help to convince me that you have though i cannot but respect you greatly for the frankness of your application to me on this subject  we were earnest chevalier we were warm in what we said   well my lord called upon as you both were it would not have become your characters to be cool  for my own part i have been recollecting the behavior of your admirable sister throughout every stage of her delirium respecting myself and i have not been able to call to mind one instance in it of an attachment merely personal i need not tell you father nor you my lord what a zealous catholic she is she early wished me to be one and had i not thought myself obliged in honor because of the confidence placed in me by the whole family to decline the subject our particular conversations when she favored me with the name of tutor would have generally taken that turn her unhappy illness was owing to her zeal for religion and to her concealing her struggles on that account she never hinted at marriage in her resveries she was still solicitous for the soul of the man she wished to proselyte and declared herself ready to lay down her life could she have effected that favorite wish of her heart at other times she supposed my marriage with some other woman and was only generously solicitous that it should not be with one who might discredit the regard she herself professed for me at another time she wished to be acquainted with my sisters and hoped they would come to italy she proposed to perfect them in the italian tongue as they should her in the english but as to me only bespoke a visit from me nowandthen when they came i have the vanity to think that i stand high in her favor but religion it is evident as it ought stands higher from all these recollections and observations i have endeavored to account for the noble behavior of your sister and am the less surprised at it now she is come to her memory it is all great all uniform and most probably we should have been in a very different situation than what we have been long in had she had her way given her at the time she was so earnest  for what only to be allowed a second interview a farewell visit when she had shown a little before on a first that marriage seemed not to be in her thoughts  and had she not been entrusted to the management of the cruel laurana said the bishop   from which thank god said the father i was the instrument of freeing her  by all this proceeded i i mean not recrimination but only to observe the consistency of the noble ladys mind when she was able to reflect and what now remains for me to do but to reconcile myself if possible to a conduct that i must ever admire however i may in its consequences as to my own particular regret it  your lordship i am afraid thinks that she adheres to the contents of the paper she put into my hands  unless you chevalier   that my lord is out of the question let it however be remembered that i have not prescribed to her that hard condition which is made an indispensable one to me yet is lady clementina the only woman on earth that i would have wished to call mine on the terms on which i should have been proud to receive her hand for it is easy to foresee that generally great inconveniences must attend a marriage between persons of a different religion one of them zealous the other not indifferent  but chevalier you acquit father marescotti and me  i do my lord be you your own judges the condition was not proposed by me i consented to it for the sake of those who prescribed it and for your sisters sake i could not wish to prosecute my humble suit notwithstanding her declared favor for me against the pleas of conscience which she so earnestly urged how could i while religion and the generosity of her friends to her required as she thought that she should get above all regards for me i was therefore willing to comply with the proposal and to wait the issue of her spontaneous determination and to be governed by it but now that your lordship and father marescotti have dispensed with the condition i presume that i am not bound by it  what means my grandison  only this i could not be thought to bear a love so fervent to the admirable clementina as the man ought to bear who aspires to the honor of calling her his if i made not one effort to convince her that she may be happy with me as to the article she is so solicitous about  from female delicacy she may perhaps expect to be argued with and to be persuaded allow me to give her assurances of my inviolable honor in that point it becomes me as a man and as her admirer to remove her scruples if i can before i yield up my love to the force of them  would you argue with her on the merits of the two persuasions  i would not i never did i would only assure her of my firm resolution never to attempt to bring her over to mine nor to traverse the endeavors of her confessor to keep her steady in hers but were we to consider only her future ease of mind you see my lord that she herself has a view to that in the proposal made me as from herself in which the happiness of all your family is included it is right to see if she builds on a foundation that cannot be shaken that she may not hereafter regret the steps she has taken which might possibly   i understand you chevalier  it is prudently it is kindly put as well for her sake as ours  i shall be glad my lord that you should be within hearing of every word that shall pass between us on this occasion one effort i ought to make if she is determined i will not urge her further for all the world and the dear clementina in it i would not have her act against her conscience nor will i take advantage of the declaration she has repeatedly made that it is in my power to hold her fast or to set her free i will not so much as urge it to her left if she should alter her purpose it should be from the conscience of a kind of promise implied in that declaration and not from her heart no my lord she shall be wholly free i will not excellent as she is accept of her hand against her conscience neither my conscience nor let me say my pride will permit me to do so but the world as well as my own heart would blame me if i made not one effort if it fail i shall be easier in my own mind and so will she in hers be you my lord within hearing of our next conversation  i would not dr bartlett propose to father marescotti that he should for fear of making him uneasy on his listening to what passed between the lady and me  i can absolutely depend upon your honor chevalier replied the bishop we have brought ourselves to be sincere favorers of this alliance with you but i own to you that both father marescotti and myself on the unexpected turn my sister has voluntarily taken are of opinion that you will both be happier if it take not place the difference in religion her malady   no more my lord of this subject if i cannot succeed i must endeavor to draw consolation to myself from reason and reflection mean time all i ask is that you will both acquit me of any supposed breach of condition as well in your own minds as to the rest of the family if i make this one effort after which if it succeed not i will whatever i suffer divest myself of self and join with you and father marescotti to secure the ground gained in the restoration of the noblest of female minds  they looked upon each other as if they were afraid of the event the father whispered the bishop i believe by a word or two that i could not but hear it was to induce him to place himself so as to hear as i had proposed the conversation that was next to pass between the lady and me  turning round on their whispering dont i see camilla my lord said i at distance watching our motions as if she wanted an opportunity to speak to one of us  she has been walking for some time within sight said father marescotti  the bishop made signs to her to advance she did and told me that her young lady was desirous to see me  i followed her clementina was alone camilla introduced me to her and withdrew  she was in great confusion on my approach her complexion frequently varied she looked at me often and as often turned away her eyes and sighed two or three times she hemmed as if she would have cleared her voice but could not find words to express her laboring mind it was easy to see that her perplexity was not favorable to me i thought it would be cruel not to break the way for her to speak  let not my dear clementina forbear to say all that is in her heart to the man who greatly prefers her peace of mind to his own  i had i had said she a great deal to say before i saw you but now you are present  she stopped  take time to recollect yourself madam  i have been talking in the garden to my lord the bishop and to father marescotti i greatly revere them both you have consulted them on the contents of the paper you are pleased to put into my hands i have hopes from thence that you may be made easy in your mind i will never dearest madam urge you on the article of religion you shall be absolute mistress of your own will you shall prescribe to me what conditions you please with regard to your way of life your pleasures your gratuities to your servants and others father marescotti and your camilla with you you will be as safe from innovation as you can be in your fathers house  ah chevalier  we may perhaps prevail upon your father and mother to honor us with their company in your first journey to england they have not been of late so well as it were to be wished we have baths there of sovereign efficacy in many disorders by using them and change of climate they will very probably receive benefit in their healths jeronymo   ah chevalier  she arose from her seat and reseated herself several times with great emotion i proceeded  jeronymo our dear jeronymo i hope will accompany us and his skilful lowther those baths are restorative  o chevalier what a man you are   she stopped with an air of attention as if she wished me to proceed   and when your honored and beloved friends shall see their clementina happy as i am determined she shall be if all the tenderness of affection i am able to show can make her so how happy will they all be  your chapel madam your confessor your own servants   ah sir sir  ought i to listen to such temptations after what i have given you upon deliberation in writing good heaven and the whole heavenly host direct me   she had recourse to her beads and her lips as a word nowandthen halfpronounced informed me moved to a paternoster again she assumed an attentive air  my sisters madam will revere you you will have pleasure in calling them yours their lords are men of the first figure in their country i ask not for fortune i ask only for you and you i ask of yourself my estate is considerable and improving the pride i take in being independent and in the power of obliging suffers me not to be imprudent with regard to economy my capital mansion i value it for not being a house of yesterday though not so magnificent as your palace in bologna is genteel spacious convenient the paper you gave me shows me that the grandeur of your soul is equal to that of your birth i revere you for the pious and noble sentiments contained in it what obligations will you lay me under to your goodness if you can prevail upon yourself to rely upon my assurances that i will never seek to make you unhappy on a religious account and if you can be satisfied with the enjoyment of your own religion and leave to me the exercise of mine dear madam why may not this be why will you not leave me as free as i am ready to leave you justice generosity are my pleas to a lady who surely cannot but be just and generous think madam dear lady clementina think if you cannot by making me happy be yourself so  i took her unresisting hand and kissed it she sighed she wept she was silent  with what pleasure proceeded i will you every other year visit and revisit england and your native country how dear will you be to your old friends and to your new in turn never revisiting england without some of your relations to accompany you now one now another and who will be of our family your grandison madam allow me to say your grandison has not he presumes to aver a narrow heart you see how well he can live with the most zealous of your religion yet not be an hypocrite but when called upon sears not to avow his own  my dearest clementina again i pressed her hand with my lips say you think you can be happy and yet bless me with your love  o sir god is my witness  but leave me leave me for a few moments i dare not trust myself with myself  command me not to leave you madam till you resolve in my favor  say cannot you be happy in the free exercise of your own religion  father marescotti camilla with you  in england but one year at a time  in italy under the reassuring eye of your father mother brothers the next  ah sir you must retire  indeed you must you leave me not at liberty  you must let me consider  on this crisis of time as far as i know depends an eternity of happiness or misery  command me not from you bid me not leave you obey the tender impulse that i flatter myself i discover in my favor i seek your happiness in pursuing my own your eternal welfare cannot be endangered my conscience will oblige me to strengthen yours when i see it is yours  bid me not leave you  excellent clementina bid me not leave you   you must you must  how can i trust myself against a voice that is the voice of love and claims my kindness my justice my generosity  was i ever ungenerous unjust unkind  and if thus staggered now what were i to be yours would the superadded sense of my duty do  o leave me sir a few moments leave me  be propitious madam be propitious to my humble hope that is all i will at present say and now i obey you  profoundly bowing i withdrew into the next apartment she to her closet  i went out slowly and heard the hasty motion of somebody going out of the apartment as i entered it it was it seems the bishop who had placed himself within hearing of what passed between his sister and me as i had desired he would  it was a full quarter of an hour before i heard her move and then it was to seek for me  i was sitting in a pensive mood revolving the embarrasments i had met with from some of the best of women and as you my dear dr bartlett know in different countries and particularly the unexpected turn which the excellent creature had taken she approached me with an air of majesty yet mixed with tenderness i met her and with a bent knee taking her hand  my fate hangs upon those lips said i and was proceeding when interrupting me  o sir i hear not it is not safe for me to hear that voice accompanying this manner  let me bend to you  i have been craving the divine direction an irresistible impulse surely it is that direction bids me say  yet what can i say  if i attempt to argue i am lost  does not this show me that were i to be yours i must be all you wish me to be and then my everlasting peace my everlasting happiness  o sir i doubt not your justice your generosity  but i fear myself  seek not let me repeat and looked a little wildly seek not kindest of men to entangle me with your love  she bent her knee and i was afraid would have fainted i clasped my supporting arms about her  let me let me cut short all i intended to say said she by referring to my paper the contents of that are not cannot be answered to my satisfaction be my advocate to yourself to your own heart and seek not to entangle me with your love  whatever it cost me taking both her hands in mine and bowing upon them i will yield to your pleasure i never will urge you again on this subject unless your brother the bishop give me hope of your welcome change of mind  best of men said she withdrawing her hands and clasping them together  but this is not enough  you must promise me your future friendship you must let me call you brother you must be my tutor i your pupil once more  happy days were those the happiest of my life and encourage and confirm in me the resolution i have taken or i shall not be happy  look upon me madam as your brother as your friend but this latter task requires more magnanimity than i am master of to your brother the bishop and to father marescotti i must leave that task they will be in earnest in it i cannot because i am convinced in my own mind that we might have been happy  could you  but i forbear though with difficulty  i have promised not to urge you further  indeed i have cousulted them both resumed she but not before i had given you my written determination had they given their opinions different from what they did i never could have got over the apprehensions i have of your strength and my own weakness i only consulted them in hopes they would as they could or thy had not been good catholics confirm and strengthen my mind and why why should i punish the man i must for ever esteem as my best friend with a wife that her unhappy malady has made unworthy of him dear chevalier i find myself at times not recovered i may never be quite well you and yours deserve not to be punished but rewarded believe me sir this has been a second consideration with me god enable me to adhere to my resolution for his sake for your sake and for the sake of my own peace of mind  must it not be difficult my dear dr bartlett more difficult than when i came over to bologna to give up all hopes of so exalted a woman  but say chevalier you are not angry with me say that you do not that you will not think me ungrateful to obviate such a charge as that of ingratitude to a man who has laid us all under such obligations  what is it that i would not do  i cannot be displeased with you madam you cannot be ungrateful i must not speak yet hardly know how to be silent i will take a walk in the garden i have a new lesson to learn  with profound reverence i withdrew she rang camilla came in   i hastened into the garden greatly dissatisfied with myself yet hardly knowing why i thought i wanted somebody to accuse somebody to blame  yet how could it be clementina but the words narrow zeal  sweet enthusiast  as if i would find fault with her religion involuntarily slipped from me to myself  it is difficult my dear dr bartlett at the instant in which the heart finds itself disappointed of some darling hope to avoid reflections that however can only be justified by selfpartiality what must i be if led as i have been by all her friends to hope i had not been earnest in my hope  the bishop joined me in the garden  excuse me grandison said he for breaking in upon your contemplations but i was desirous to apologize to you for taking the liberty though you allowed it to me of attending to what passed between you and my sister  i should my lord have said everything i did say to your sister the occasion the same before your whole assembled family your lordship has therefore no apologies to make to me heard you all that passed  i believe i did those apartments were always the womens camilla placed me in a closet that i knew not of where i heard every word you both said of the last part of your conversation i must ask you chevalier  is not clementina   clementina my lord is all that is great and good in woman you will imagine that it would have been much more easy for me to support myself under the resolution she has taken had i not had such testimonies of her magnanimity permit me my lord to say that i have one good quality i can admire goodness or greatness wherever i meet with it and whether it makes for me or against me clementina has all my reverence  he made me compliments and withdrew  the marquis the count and the marchioness afterward joined me in the garden the bishop and father marescotti not coming with them or presently after them i doubted not but they went to clementina in order to applaud her for and confirm her in a resolution which must be agreeable to them i was right in my conjecture  the marquis and count each took my hand and first expressed their surprise at the young ladys adherence to her resolution and next their high value of me the marchioness observed that her daughter with all her excellencies was ever difficult of persuasion when she had deliberately resolved upon any point  it was easy i said to see that they all now were of one opinion which was that lady clementina was not to be moved from her present purpose  they owned they were but said that if it were not mine they thought themselves bound in honor to consent that i should try by generous means and they were sure i would not think of any other to prevail upon her in my favor  i presume said i that the bishop has already acquainted you with the substance of what passed just now between lady clementina and me  they were silent  has not your ladyship seen lady clementina since  i have and she is extremely uneasy she wishes you could be of our religion could it have been so i for my part should rather have called the chevalier grandison my son than any man in the world clementina told me added she i cannot but say with more composure than i could have expected though not without tears that you promised to urge her no more on this subject she owns that more than once as you talked to her she could hardly forbear giving you her hand on your own terms but she says that you were the most generous of men when you saw she made a point of conscience of her adherence to her newlytaken resolution and now chevalier having made my lord and the count acquainted with all these things we are come to advise with you what is to be done  dear grandison said the marquis advise us we want an opportunity to show you in more than words our gratitude for all your goodness to us we want to appease our jeronymo who is ready to suspect that his brother and father marescotti have contributed to this turn in our daughters mind and we want you to declare freely your own sentiments with regard to clementina and whether you would advise us as well for her own sake as for yours to endeavor to prevail on her to change her mind dear creature a relapse would now be fatal to her and to her mother and me  i have no difficulty my lord to answer to these points as to the first i am greatly rewarded by the pleasure i have in the more than could be hopedfor happy effects of mr lowthers skill and in the prospects that open to us of lady clementinas restored health of mind on this subject i have but one request to make it is that you will not mortify me so much as to suppose that i am not sufficiently rewarded  as to appeasing the generous mind of signor jeronymo let that task be lady clementinas she can plead conscience with more force for herself than any second person can do for her and if she does it will be a demonstration to us all of her being likely to be happy in her perseverance  more happy than i shall be the admirable lady who has silenced on this head a man so deeply interested to contest this point with her will certainly be able to appease a brother by the same pleas and the sooner as being of the same religion with the lovely pleader her arguments will have greater force with him than they could be supposed to have on me for let me say my lord that i could not so much as seem to give way to them had i not been accustomed when i was to judge of anothers actions to suppose myself that very person hence have i often thought myself obliged to give judgment against my own wishes though on resumeing myself i have not found reason to disapprove of my first expectation  as to the third point what can i say  and yet as your lordship has put it does it not call upon me as i may say to give a proof of the disinterestedness i have mentioned i answer then as supposing myself in your situation  i cannot expect that you will urge an interest which i by having put myself into that of lady clementina have promised not to urge unless she change her mind what plea can a parent make use of but that of filial duty and where the child can plead conscience in answer ought it to be insisted on  and now resuming myself let me presume to advise you to give the dear lady full time to consider and reconsider the case her imagination may be heated in other words her malady may have a share in the heroism she has so nobly exerted and yet i am afraid she will persevere permit me my lords to say afraid i cannot wholly divest myself of self in this very affecting case we will not therefore take her at her word i will absent myself for some time from bologna but as she has the goodness to acknowledge an esteem for me with her leave i will return at my time i will repeat my absences if we have the least shadow of doubt but if she hold her purpose and shall not be visibly worse in her health or mind we may conclude her resolution unalterable in this case i shall have one or two requests to make you and if granted will endeavor to make myself as happy as a man in such a situation can be  they applauded my advice they declared themselves unwilling to think of giving up the pleasure they had brought themselves to have in considering me as one of their family and assured me that it would have been impossible that any the least difficulty should have arisen from them after they had brought themselves to dispense with the most material one  they were earnest with me to pass the evening with them but i excused myself i wanted to be at my own lodgings in order to revolve all that had passed but having not taken leave of lady clementina i imagined she might think i went away in ill humor if i forbore it my whole study i told them should be to make lady clementina easy and if the marchioness would be so good as to permit me to take leave of her for the evening in her presence i would depart only making my compliment to signor jeronymo by mr lowther knowing that he would be grieved for my disappointment and my mind not being at present easy enough to contend with his concern for me  the michioness said she would see the way her clementina was then in and acquaint me by camilla with her wishes and then withdrew leaving the marquis the count and me together  before we could renew our discourse the bishop and father marescotti joined us both in high spirits they were excessively complaisant to me it was easy to guess at the occasion of their good humor i could not be greatly delighted with it but when the count told them what had passed before they joined us the bishop embraced me the father unawares snatched my hand and kissed it  i was glad to be relieved from their compliments by the expected message from the marchioness and clementina  the young lady met me as i entered at the door of her apartment she held out her hand to me i respectfully took it i saw she had been in tears but she looked with a serenity that i was glad to see though i doubted not but it was partly owing to the conversation she had had since i left her with her brother and her confessor as well as to what might have passed between her mother and her  she led me to a chair between them both she withdrew not her hand and aimed at a more cheerful countenance than i had a heart i congratulated her on her serenity it is in your power sir said she to make me still more serene  can you of a truth and from your heart approve of my present way of thinking can you chevalier   i can admire you for it madam you have exalted yourself in my opinion but i must regret it  because  but i have promised not to urge you your conscience madam is concerned  to endeavor but to persuade against conscience if you have no doubt of your motive is not warranted even in a parent  i am i think i am returned she absolutely sure of my motive but my dear mamma be pleased to put the questions i wished you to put to the chevalier  she still suffered me to withold her hand and with the other took out her handkerchief not to wipe away her tears but to hide her blushes she wept not her bosom heaved with the grandeur of her sentiments  the question my dear grandison said the marchioness is this  we have all of us told my clementina that you are invincible on the article of religion she believes us she doubts it not from your behavior and words but as she would not omit any means to convince you of her high regard for you she is desirous to hear from your own lips that you are not to be convinced she is not afraid the article so important to hear you declare that you will not be a catholic it will make her more easy upon reflection to be told by you yourself that you cannot comply even were she to consent to be yours at a very short day if you could   the exalted lady stood up still not withdrawing her hand  false shame i despise thee said she yet covered with blushes she turned her face from me  that hand as this heart putting her other hand to her throbbing bosom is yours on that one condition  i am convinced of your affection for me  but fear not to tell me it is for my own future peace of mind that i ask it that you cannot accept it on the terms she then withdrew her hand and would have gone from me but again i snatched it with both mine  do you most excellent of human beings let me ask you do you consider the inequality in the case between us as you are pleased to put it i presume not to require a change of principles in you you are only afraid of your perseverance though you are to be left to your freedom and your confessor to strengthen and confirm you of me is not an actual change required against conviction  dearest lady clementina can you can you your mind great and generous in every other case insist upon a condition so unequal  be great throughout and i kneeled to her  be uniformly noble  withdraw not your hand  she struggled it however from me and hastening to her closet  once more chevalier said she read my paper  i left her and approaching the marchioness who was in tears judge me madam said i as i in your opinion deserve  what shall i say  i can urge my hopes no farther my promise is against me clementina is despotic  forgive me  but indeed clementina is not impartial   dear chevalier said the marchioness giving me her hand what can i say  i admire you i glory in my child i could not myself in her place have withstood your plea when her imagination is cool i still question if she will hold her purpose  propose to her if you can engage her to descend from these heights your intended absences  you must calm her you only can her soul is wrought up to too high a pitch  o madam but i must first try to quiet my own  i withdrew into the room adjoining and in two or three minutes returning found the lovely daughter incircled by the arms of the indulgent mother both in tears clementina was speaking these were the words i heard her say  indeed my dearest mamma i am not angry with the chevalier why should i but he can allow for me i cannot be so great as he dont i say that i should be undone by his goodness  she turned her head and seeing me disengaged herself from her mothers arms and met me allow for me sir i beseech you said she i may be partial i believe i am but you can forgive me i will hope you can  read my paper said i and went from you but it was not in anger read it i again say i can give no other answer i never can be happy with a man whom i think a heretic and the moment i should in tenderness in duty think him not one i shall cease myself to be a catholic a husband sir allied to perdition what wife can bear the reflection  the chevalier my dear urges you not he adheres to his promise you were willing to put a question to him yourself i consented that he should answer it in your presence for the sake of your future peace of mind he has spoken to it like himself he has shown you how much he admires you at the same time that he signifies his inviolable adherence to his own religion my dearest love he has conceded to terms in our favor that we have not conceded to in his glorious and unexceptionable is his adherence were it to a right religion he believes it is he might urge much to his own advantage from your adherence to yours but he has only hinted at that to us not to you he is willing to wait the event of your own will he will leave us as he did more than once before and return and if you persevere he will endeavor to make himself easy   and leave us and return to england i suppose  no doubt of it my dear   while the florentine is there   i never madam can be anything but a wellwisher to the florentine   god give you sir and me too ease of mind but i find my head overstrained it is bound round as with a cord i think putting her hands to each side of it for a moment  you must leave me sir but if you will see me tomorrow morning and tell me whither you intend to go and what you intend to do i shall be obliged to you cannot we talk together sir as brother and sister or as tutor and pupil  those were happy days let us try to recover them  she put her hand to her forehead as apprehensive of disorder and looked discomposed i bowed to both ladies in silence retired and without endeavoring to see anybody else went to my lodgings  letter xxix sir charles grandison in continuation bologna thursday july      i had a visit early this morning from the count of belvedere be found me very much indisposed he had heard that i had met with some difficulties and attributed my indisposition to them  i owned that it might be so my life my lord said i has not been so happy as might have been hoped for by a man who has made it his study to avoid giving offense either to man or woman and has endeavored to restrain passions that otherwise might have been as unruly as those of other young men in my circumstances but i bless god i have resolution i may bend beneath a weight when it is first laid upon me but if i find i cannot shake it off i will endeavor to collect my strength and make myself easy under it pardon me my lord i do not often allow my mind to break out thus into words but i hold the count of belvedere for my friend  you do me honor said he and i came with a heart disposed to cultivate your friendship i thank you for your last goodness to me your advice and gentle behavior when i was not fit to be trusted with myself have saved me as far as i know from final destruction to the last day of my life i shall confess obligation to you but dear chevalier if some account of the difficulties you meet with will not be a renewal of grief now you are not very well   it will not be so my lord interrupted i since at present i can think of nothing else yet putting myself in the place of every one of the family of porretta i have nobody to blame but the contrary and i must admire lady clementina as one of the noblest of women  he was all impatience for further particulars  what may yet be the event i cannot tell proceeded i therefore will only say that difference in religion is the difficulty with the lady i am willing to allow her the full and free exercise of hers she insists upon a change of mine for the rest you my lord want not friends among the principals of the family let them give you what account they think fit i would not scruple to gratify your curiosity could i give you a conclusive one  i am curious chevalier said he i loved clementina above all women before her illness i loved her not the less for her illness for then my pity joined with my love and added a tenderness to it of which i had not in equal degree been before sensible the treatment she met with and the selfinterested cruelty of lady laurana heightened her illness and that i did not think it possible my love in order to free her from that treatment and in hopes that a different one my hopes you see were not ill founded would restore her reason and that the happy result might be the defeating of the cruel lauranas expectations i tendered myself in marriage to her notwithstanding her illness but i must say that i never knew how much i loved her till i was apprehensive that not only i but italy and her religion were likely to lose her for ever and will you not allow of my curiosity now god give you chevalier health and happiness here and hereafter but may you never be the husband of clementina but of some woman of your own country if there be one in it that can deserve you  the count left me with this wish pronounced with earnestness and i suppose will visit the bishop and father marescotti in order to gratify his curiosity  my indisposition requiring indulgence i sent a billet to the marchioness excusing my attendance till the afternoon on the score of an unexpected engagement i was loath to mention that i was not very well lest it should be thought a loverlike artifice to move compassion i will not owe my success even with a clementina to mean contrivances you know i have pride my dear friend  pride which your example has not been able to subdue though it has sometimes made me ashamed of it  one oclock camilla by direction of her two ladies made me a visit about two hours ago they were alarmed at my postponing my attendance on lady clementina till the afternoon suspecting that the count of belvedere had unwelcomely engaged me and therefore sent the worthy woman to know the true cause camilla observing that i looked ill i desired her to take no notice of it to anybody but she could not help acquainting the marchioness with it who ordering her to forbear mentioning it to clementina and jeronymo was so good attended by father marescotti to make me a visit in person  never was mother more tender to her own son than she was to me the father expressed a paternal affection for me i made light of the illness being resolved if possible to attend them in the afternoon my mind my dear friend is disturbed i want to be at a certainty yet from what the marchioness hinted i believe i have no reason to doubt the father and the bishop have spared no pains i dare say to strengthen the ladys scruples their whole study the marchioness intimated is now in what menner to acknowledge their obligations to me  they owe me none  my dear chevalier said she at parting take care of your health she put her hand on mine  your precious health dont think of coming out we will in turn attend you here  notwithstanding the advice of the marchioness i went to the palace of porretta as soon as i thought their dinnertime was over signor jeronymo desired to be alone with me for a few minutes and when he was began upon the subject of the unexpected turn which his sister had taken i found that he had been acquainted with the truth of everything not a single circumstance was omitted that might enable him to judge fairly of the whole  and will you grandison can you my dear friend said he have the goodness to attend with patience the event of this dear girls heroism or what shall i call it  i assured him that the restoration of his sisters health of mind was the dearest to me of all considerations and that i came over at first with no other hopes than his recovery and hers resolved to leave to providence all the rest  the marchioness came in soon after and taking me aside chid me with tenderness even maternal for coming abroad the marquis the count the bishop and father marescotti joined us and then they all as with one voice offered to use their interests with clementina in my favor if either my peace of mind or my health were likely to be affected by her present resolution  while there was conscience in it i answered i would not for the world that she should be urged to change it nothing now as i believed remained to be done but to try the firmness of her resolution by first short and then longer absences and those i would propose to herself if they thought fit when i was next admitted to her presence  jeronymo and all the family i saw were of one mind tell me say my dear dr bartlett is it excusable in a man who has been so long favored by your conversation and should have been benefited by your example who have behaved so greatly in disappointments and even persecutions to find in himself a pride that at the instant had almost carried him into petulance when he saw every one of this family appear to be more pleased than displeased that he was not likely to be allied to them  who yet when he coolly considers and puts himself in the case of each individual of it must acknowledge that they might well be allowed to rejoice the great article of religion out of the question in the hope of keeping her among them in her native country and the more because of the unhappy disorder of her mind and out of a distant one obnoxious to them all as england is would not my own father and mother would not i myself have equally rejoiced in such a turn in the affections of a sister of my own especially if we had complied with her principally from motives of compassion and contrary to the interests of our family  the marchioness conducted me to the young lady she received me with a blush as a person would do another whom she was sensible she had causelessly disappointed she took notice after the first emotion that i seemed not to be well and cast an eye of compassion on me a slight indisposition i said that might perhaps be owing to my late inactivity and want of exercise i had thoughts of once more making the tour of italy in order to visit the many kind friends at different courts who had honored me with their notice during my former abode in italy  how long do you propose to be absent sir  perhaps a month madam  a month sir  she sighed and looked down  signor jeronymo i hope said i will correspond with me  i could almost wish said she  pardon me madam to her mother  and looked bashfully down  what would my child wish  that i might correspond with the chevalier in his absence  as his sister as his pupil i think i might   you will do me madam the highest honor  dear madam to the marchioness may i not have your interest with lady clementina to engage her to pursue her kind hint  by all means my dearest love it will not misbecome you in any character whether as pupil as sister or friend to write to such a man as the chevalier grandison  perhaps then i may said she you madam shall see all that passes in this correspondence  that shall be as you please my love i can absolutely depend upon the chevaliers generosity and your prudence  i should choose madam said i that you should see all that passes as amusement is principally my view in this tour i can be punctual to place and time  but shall you be gone a month sir  as much less madam as you shall command  nay as things are circumstanced it is not for me  she stopped sighed and looked down  you madam are above unnecessary reserve i never yet abused a confidence i am proud of your good opinion i never will do anything to forfeit it whatever shall be your pleasure that signify to me in the letters you will favor me with i will be all grateful obedience  whither sir do you intend to go first  to florence madam   to florence sir  but lady olivia i think is not there  to mrs beaumont i suppose  i will send you madam from florence the beginning letter of the hopedfor correspondence i will be careful to be within distance of receiving your favor in a very short space by means of a servant whom i will leave at florence to attend to our correspondence  and when sir do you leave bologna  i will now take leave of my new correspondent and my dear friends here and dispose myself for my little route  she looked at her mother then at me  again sighed blushed and looked down  well sir was all she said  will you not drink chocolate with us tomorrow said the marchioness  i excused myself as i was not well i thought i might be obliged to keep my chamber for two or three days and that therefore it was better to take leave of her then that i might not give them anxiety for their own sakes on a supposal that i owed my indisposition to my disappointment and yet dr bartlett  but you know my heart and all its imperfections and will you not on this extraordinary occasion allow me to give way to my native pride for my own sake who but must admire the exalted mind of this young lady what man would not wish her to be his  but to covet a relation to a family however illustrious however worthy every one of which wishes and with reason on his side that it may not take place  i must if possible  but a few weeks will now determine my fate  i will not leave them or myself if i can help it any cause of regret  i took a solemn leave of clementina she wept at parting and dropping down on one knee prayed for a blessing to attend me wherever i went  even had not my indisposition lowered my spirits i should have been affected at the solemnity and grace of her manner the marchioness was  i went from her to jeronymo i left it to his mother to tell him all that had passed and took almost as ardent a leave of him i desired a visit from mr lowther and left my compliments for the rest of a family that i ever must highly respect  thursday july      i took by advice a medicine overnight that composed me i had wanted rest i am much better and preparing for my journey to florence i have returned answer that i am to enquiries made after my health by the whole family the bishop excused his personal attendance on the counts sudden resolution to set out for urbino and insisting on his and father marescottis accompanying him thither for a few days  camilla came to me from her two ladies and the marquis all three she told me were indisposed their enquiries after my health were very tender the marquis bid her tell me that he hoped to be well enough to make me a visit before i set out jeronymo wished to see me first if i had opportunity but as i probably must if i go see lady clementina and another solemn parting will follow i think it will be best for both our sakes as well as for jeronymos not to obey him and so i hinted by camilla  the count of belvedere has made me a visit he is setting out for parma not one word passed his lips about lady clementina or her family he was very earnest with me to promise him a visit at his palace i gave him room to expect me by his silence on a subject so near his heart as well as by the very great respect he paid me i have no reason to doubt but he knows the situation i am in with clementina she will have his prayers i dare say for perseverance in her present way of thinking indeed now everybodys of her family  for who can doubt the generals she would have had mine to the same purpose the more sincerely had not they all joined to indulge my hopes and had she not given such instances of the noblest of female minds  but how great soever may be the occasion given me for fortitude by a resolution so unexpected by everybody from lady clementina i cannot be deprived of all pleasure since the contents of my last pacquets as well those from paris as from england afford me a great deal  everything is done at paris that i could have wished in relation to mr danbys legacy  lord w lets me know that he thinks himself every day happier than in the past with his lady who also subscribes to the same acknowledgment  our beauchamp tells me that he wants only my company to make him the happiest of men he requests me to write a letter of thanks in my own name to lady beauchamp on his dutiful acknowledgment to me of her kindness to him i will with pleasure comply and the sooner as i am sure that gratitude for past benefits and not expectation of new ones is his motive  he laments in postscript that his father is taken with a threatening disorder i am sorry for it methinks i am interested in the life and health of sir harry beauchamp i hope he will long enjoy the happiness of which his son says he is extremely sensible should he die the lady will be a great deal in my beauchamps power large as her jointure is if he be not on such an event as obliging to her as he now is and forget not all past disobligations i shall not have the opinion of his heart that i now have our beauchamp wants but the trial of prosperity a much more arduous one than that of adversity to be upon full proof an excellent man  lady mansfield with equal joy and gratitude acquaints me that my presence in england is only wanting to bring to a decision every point that now remains in debate with her adversaries the keelings they having shown themselves inclinable by the mediation of sir john lambton to compromise on the terms i had advised she should get proposed as from me and the wicked bolton having also made proposals that perhaps ought to be accepted if he cannot be brought to amend them  two of emilys letters of distant date are come together i will write to the dear girl by the next mail and let her know how much absence endears to me my friends  you give me joy my dear dr bartlett in acquainting me with the happiness of lord and lady g i will write to my charlotte upon it and thank her for the credit she does me by her affectionate behavior to that honest and obliging man  how happy are you my dear friend and lord and lady g and emily at miss byrons i am charmed with the characters you give me of her family  but i have letters brought by the same mail that are not so agreeable as those i have taken notice of they are from lady olivia and my poor cousin grandison  that unhappy woman is to be my disturbance she is preparing she says to come back to italy she execrates she threatens poor woman but no more of her at present  my cousin is by this time i suppose at paris he writes that he was on the point of setting out in pursuance of my advice and will wait there for my direction to proceed to italy or not i shall write to him to continue there till he hears further from me and at the same time to some of my friends there to make france agreeable to him  i shall not perhaps write again very soon letters from england will however find an easy access directed to me under cover to mrs beaumont at florence as you know how  i shall be pretty much in motion if health permit i shall take a view of the works projecting by the duke of modena in order to render his little signory considerable i shall visit the count of belvedere at parma mrs beaumont and her friends will have more of my company than any other persons perhaps i may make a longrequested visit to the altieri family at urbino if i do i must not put a slight on the conte della porretta who pressingly invited me thither i think to pass a few days at rome if i go from thence to naples i shall perhaps once more in the generals company visit portici in order to make more accurate observations than i have hitherto done on those treasures of antiquity which have been discovered in the ancient herculaneum  i have a private intimation from milan that a visit there would be a welcome one to lady sforza i may possibly take that city in my way when i quit italy but how can i without indignation see the cruel laurana  thus my dear and reverend friend have i given you an imperfect sketch of my present intentions as to passing the month that i think of absenting myself from bologna  it is a long time since i have been able to tell you aforehand with regard to some of the most material articles of my life what i will or will not do yet knowing my own motives i cannot say that were the last three or four years of it to come over again i should have acted otherwise than i have done do you my reverend friend with that freedom which has been of inexpressible use to me remind me if i am too ready to acquit myself you know i repeat all the secrets of my heart be not partial to your sincere friend i write not to be praised but corrected dont flatter my vanity i am yet but a young man you have not blamed me a great while i am for this reason a little diffident of the ground i stand upon but if you have no material fault to recollect spare yourself the trouble of telling me so having thus renewed my call upon you for your friendly admonition i will look upon your silence as an acquittal so far as i have gone and we will begin from the date of your next a new account in the mean time he not concerned for my health i am much better than i was my mind was weakened by suspense i long since thought the crisis near if it be not already overpast a few weeks must surely determine it i am not in haste to send this packet a week hence sir alexander nesbit will set out directly for england he has a great desire of being acquainted with my dear dr bartlett and requests me to give him a commission that may introduce him to you were my future destiny in this country absolutely determined i would not however have delayed sending you these letters by a speedier conveyance  sir alexander is a worthy man as such wants not a recommendation to my dear and reverend friend from his  charles grandison  letter xxx lady g to miss byron with the preceding seven letters of sir charles  grosuenorsquare tuesday aug   good god my dear  i dispatch a packet to you received a few hours ago from dr bartlett with desire of forwarding it to you my sister was with me we read the letters together i dispatch them by an express messenger  what shall we say tell me harriet more suspense still dear creature tell me tell me all you think of the contents of this packet if i enter into the particulars i shall never have done scribbling adieu my love  charlotte g return the letters when perused i want to study them before the doctor has them back    letter xxxi miss byron to lady g selbyhouse friday aug    tell you my dear lady g all i think of the contents of the packet you so kindly sent me by an express messenger  what will you say to me if i do i can much better tell you what all my friends here say of them they are for congratulating me upon those contents but can i congratulate myself can i receive their congratulations a woman an angel  so much more worthy of sir charles grandison than the poor harriet byron can be  o how great is clementina how little am i in my own eyes the lady will still be his she must she shall she will change her mind so earnest he so fervently in love with him she who will presume to hope a place in his affections after her my pride my dear is all up can i how mean will any one now appear in his eyes when he thinks of his clementina and who can be contented with half a heart nay not half a one if he does justice to this wonder of a woman it was always my consolation when i looked upon him as lost to myself that it was to a person of superior merit  but who can forbear pitying the glorious man o my dear i am lost in the subject i know not what to say were i to tell you what i thought what were my emotions as i read now his generous pity for the count of belvedere  now his affectionate and respectful address to the noble lady  her agitations of mind previous to the delivery of her paper to him  that paper the contents so greatly surpassing all that i had read of woman yet so much of a piece with the conduct she showed when the struggle between her religion and her love cost her her reason his delicacy yet equal steadiness in his religion  in short the whole of his conduct and hers in the various lights in which they appeared in the different conversations with her with her family  were i to tell you i say what i thought and what were my emotions as i read a volume would not be sufficient nor know i what measure would contain my tears suffice it to say that i was not able to rise in two days and nights and it has been with the greatest difficulty that i obtained pen and ink and leave to write and the physician talks of confining me to my chamber for a week to come  sir charles cries out upon suspense indeed it is a grievous thing  you will observe that in these last letters he mentions me but once and that is in making me a compliment on the favor which the beloved four conferred upon me and all of us in the visit you were so good as to make us and why do you think i take notice of this  not from petulance i assure you but for the praise of his justice as well as delicacy for could sir charles grandison excusably if on other occasions he remembered the poor girl whom he rescued could he excusably i say while his soul was agitated by his own suspense occasioned by the uncommon greatness of clementinas behavior think of any other woman in the world  but you see my charlotta that the excellent man has been perhaps is greatly indisposed can we wonder at it such a prize in view so many difficulties overcome as he had to struggle with yet at last a seemingly insuperable one arising from the lady herself and from motives that increased his admiration of her but a woman may be eloquent from grief and disappointment when a man though his nobler heart is torn in pieces must hardly complain  how do i pity the distresses of a manly heart  but should this noble lady on his return to bologna after a months absence hold her purpose unless he changes his religion i will tell you my thoughts of what will probably be the result he will not marry at all if he cannot love another woman as well as he does clementina ought he and who can equally deserve his love have we not heard from himself as well as from dr bartlett that all the troubles he has had have proceeded from our sex it is true that men and women can hardly ever have any great troubles but what must arise from each other and his have arisen from good women too i hope lady olivia is not deliberately bad and why should so good a man continue to make himself subject to the petulance to the foibles of us wayward women who hardly know our own minds as signor jeronymo told his friend when our wishes are in our power  but sick or well you see sir charles grandison loses not his spirit his enlarged heart can rejoice in the happiness of his friends i will have joy said he once to me and must he not have it in the hopes of the recovery of his friend jeronymo in the restoration of the admirable clementina and in the happiness those recoveries must give to a worthy and illustrious family let me enumerate from him the pleasure he enjoys in the felicity he has given to many though he cannot be in himself the happy person he makes others is he not delighted with the happiness of lord and lady w of his beauchamp and his beauchamps father and mother  of lady mansfield and her family with yours and lord gs happiness does it not rejoice you my dear to have it in your power to contribute to the pleasure of such a brother and how great how honorable how considerate how delicate is his behavior to the noble clementina how patient how disinterested with her family how ready to enter into their sentiments and to allow for them though against himself but he is prudent he sees before him at a great distance he is resolved to have nothing to reproach himself with in future that he can obviate at present but is not his conduct such as would make a considerate person who has any connections with him tremble since if there be a fault between them it must be all that persons and he will not if it be possible for him to avoid it be a sharer in it do you think my dear that had he been the first man he would have been so complaisant to his eve as milton makes adam so contrary to that part of his character which made him accuse the woman to the almighty the woman that thou gave me tempted me and i did eat  to taste the forbidden fruit because he would not be separated from her in her punishment though all posterity were to suffer by it  no it is my opinion that your brother would have had gallantry enough to his fallen spouse to have made him extremely regret her lapse but that he would have done his own duty were it but for the sake of posterity and left it to the almighty if such had been his pleasure to have annihilated his first eve and given him a second  but my dear do i not write strangely i would be cheerful if i could because you are so kind as to take pains to make me so but on reperusing what i have written i am afraid that you have taught me to think oddly tell me truth charlotte is not what has last slipped from my pen more in lady gs manner than in that of  her harriet byron one line more and no more my dear my indulgent aunt selby  they will not let me write on charlotte when i had a thousand things further to say on the contents of this important packet or i should not have concluded so uncharacteristically    letter xxxii sir charles grandison to lady clementina della porretta florence july      i begin dear and admirable lady clementina the permitted correspondence with a due sense of the favor done me in it yet can i say that it is not a painful favor was ever man before circumstanced as i am  permitted to admire the noblest and most amiable of women and even generously allowed to look upon himself as a man esteemed perhaps more than esteemed by her and her illustrious family yet in honor forbidden to solicit for a blessing that once was designed for him and which he is not accused of demeriting by misbehaviour or by assuming an appearance that he made not good  excellent lady am i other than you ever had reason to think me in my manners in my principles did i ever endeavor to unsettle you in your attachments to the religion of your country no madam invincibly attached as i knew you were to that religion i contented myself with avowing my own and indeed should have thought it an ill requital for the protection i enjoyed from the civil and ecclesiastical powers and a breach of the laws of hospitality had i attempted to unsettle the beloved daughter of a house so firmly likewise attached as they always were to their principles from such a conduct could this beloved daughter doubt the free exercise of her religion had she   but hushed be the complainings that my expostulating heart will hardly be denied to dictate to my pen have i not said that i will be all you wish me to be  all hope or all acquiescence  forgive me madam forgive me dear and evertobe respected family that yet i use the word hope such a prize almost in possession  can i forbear to say hope  yet do i not at the same time promise acquiescence  painful as it is to me and impossible as it would be were not allcommanding conscience pleaded most excellent of women i will i do acquiesce if you persevere dear to my soul as you ever must be i resign to your will  the disappointed heart not given up to unmanly despair in a world so subject to disappointments will catch at the next good to that it has lost  shall i not hope madam that a correspondence so allowably begun whatever be the issue in the greater event will for ever last that a friendship so pure will ever be allowed that the disappointed man may be considered as the son the brother of a family which must in all the branches of it be ever dear to him  i will hope it i will even demand the continuance of its esteem why should i not say of its affection but so long only as my own impartial heart and my zeal for the glory and happiness of your whole house shall tell me i deserve this and so long as i can make out my pretensions to the satisfaction of every one of it it cannot be on my side nor will i allow it on yours that the man who once by the favor of your whole family was likely to be happy in a near alliance to it should and perhaps for that reason as it often happens in like instances be looked upon as the most remote from its friendly love  never madam could the heart of man boast a more disinterested passion for an object whose mind was dearer to it than even her person or a more sincere affection to every one of her family than mine does i am unhappily called upon to the proof the proof is unquestionable and  to the last hour of my life you and they madam will be dear to me  adieu most excellent of women  circumstanced as i am what more can i say  adieu most excellent of women  may every good temporal and eternal be yours and every ones of your beloved family prays  your and their most grateful most affectionate and most obedient grandison  letter xxxiii lady clementina della porretta to sir charles grandison bologna tuesday aug   n s i was the more willing sir to become your correspondent as i thought i could write to you with greater freedom than i could speak and indeed i will be very free and very sincere in all i shall write i will suppose that i am writing when i write to you to my brother and best friend and indeed to which of my other brothers can i write with equal freedom  you in imitation of the god of us all require only the heart my heart shall be as open to you as if like him you could look into every secret recess of it  i thank you sir for the kind and generous contents of the letter by which you have opened this desirable correspondence such a regard have you paid in it to the weakness of my mind and to its late unhappy state without mentioning that unhappy state  o sir you are the most delicate of men  what tenderness have you always shown me for my attachment to the religion of my fathers  surely you are the most pious of protestants  protestants can be pious you and mrs beaumont have convinced me that they can little did i think i should ever be brought to acknowledge so much in favor of the people of your religion as you and she by your goodness have brought me to acknowledge o sir what might you not have brought me to by your love by your kind treatment of me and by your irresistible address were i to have been yours and residing in a protestant nation every one of your friends of that religion and all amiable and perhaps exemplarily good i was afraid of you chevalier but no more of this subject you are invincible and i hope i should not have been overcome had i been yours  but do we not pray against running into temptation  again i say no more of this subject at present yet hardly know how to forbear   nothing but the due consideration of the brevity as well as vanity of this life in which we are but probationers and of the eternity of the next could have influenced me to act against my heart dear chevalier how happy should i have been could i have given my hand as that heart would have directed and on such terms as i could have thought my soul secure  how shall i quit this entangling subject i am in the midst of briars and thorns  lend me lend me your extricating hand and conduct me into the smooth and pleasant path in which you at first found me walking with undoubting feet never never for my sake let an unexperienced virgin trust herself with her own imagination when she begins to meditate with pleasure the great qualities of an object with whom she has frequent opportunities of conversing  again am i recurring to a subject i wish to quit but since i cannot i will give my pen its course  pen take thy course mind equally perverse and disturbed i will give way to thee i see there is no withstanding thee   tell me then my brother my friend my faithful my disinterested friend what i shall do what method take to be indifferent to you in another character what i shall do to be able to look upon you only as my brother and friend  can you not tell me will you not will not your love of clementina permit you to tell her  i will help you to words  say you are the friend of her soul if you cannot be a catholic always be a catholic when you advise her and then from your love of her soul you will be able to say persevere clementina and i will not account you ungrateful   o chevalier i fear nothing so much as being thought capable of ingratitude by those i love and am i not can you think that i am not ungrateful once you told me so why if you mean me more than a compliment do you not tell me how to be grateful are you the only man on earth who have it in your will and in your power to confer obligations yet can be above receiving returns what services did you endeavor to do to the soul of a misguided youth at your first acquaintance with him  unhappy youth and how did he at the time requite you for them he has let us know generous selfaccuser what heroic patience you had with him and how bravely you disdained his ungrateful defiance well may he love you as he does after many many months discontinuance of friendship you were called upon to snatch him from the jaws of death by your bravery you were not requited as you might have expected from some of our family  what regret has the recollection cost us all  you were obliged to quit our italy yet called upon as i may say by your wounded friend incurably wounded as it was apprehended you hastened to him you hastened to his sister wounded in her head in her heart you hastened to her father mother brothers wounded in their minds by the sufferings of that son and daughter and whence did you hasten to us from your native country quitting your relations all proud of your love and proud of loving you on the wings of friendly zeal did you hasten to us in a distant region you encountered with you overcame a thousand obstacles the genius of healing in the form of a skilful operator accompanying you all the art of the physicians of your country did you collect to assist your noble purpose success attended your generous wishes we see one another a whole family see one another with that delight which was wont to irradiate our countenances before disaster overclouded them  and now what return shall we make for your goodness to us you say you are already rewarded in the success with which god has blessed your generous endeavors to serve us hence it is that i call you proud and at the same time happy well do i know that it is not in the power of a wife to reward you for what could a wife do by such a man more than her duty and were it possible for clementina to be yours would you that your kindness your love to her should be rewarded at the price of her everlasting happiness  no you answer  you would leave to her the full and free exercise of her religion  and can you promise can you the chevalier grandison undertake if you think your wife in an error that you never will endeavor to cure her of that error you who as the husband ought to be the regulator of her conscience the strengthener of her mind  can you believing your own religion a right one hers a wrong one be contented that she shall persevere in it or can she avoid on the same and even still stricter principles entering into debate with you and will not then her faith from your superior understanding be endangered  of what force will be my confessors arguments against yours strengthened by your love your kindness your sweetness of manners and how will all my family grieve were clementina to become indifferent to them to her country and more than indifferent to her religion  say grandison my tutor my friend my brother can you be indifferent on these weighty matters  o no you cannot my brother the bishop has told me but be not angry with my brother for telling me that you did declare to my elder brother and him that you would not in a beginning address have granted to a princess the terms you were willing to grant me and that you offered them to me as a compromise  compassion and love were equally perhaps your inducements poor clementina  yet were there not a greater obstacle in the way i would have accepted of your compassion because you are great and good and there can be no insult but true godlike pity in your compassion  well sir and do not my father my mother the best and most indulgent of fathers and mothers and do not my uncle and brothers and my other kindred comply with their clementina upon the same affectionate the same pitying motive otherwise religion country the one so different the other so remote would they have consented  they would not will you not then my dear chevalier think that i do but right knowing your motive knowing theirs knowing that to rely upon my own strength is presumption and a tempting of the almighty to act as i act to resolve as i have resolved  o do you my tutor be again my tutor  you never taught me a lesson that either of us might be ashamed to own  do you as i have begged of you in my paper strengthen my mind i own to you that i have struggled much with myself and now i am got  above myself or beneath myself i know not whether  for my letter is not such as i designed it you are too much the subject i designed only a few lines and those to express the grateful sense i have of your goodness to me and our jeronymo indeed to everybody and to beg of you for the sake of my peace of mind to point out some way by which i and all of us may demonstrate our attachment to our superior duties and our gratitude to you   what have i said what a quantity have i written  excuse my wandering head and believe me to be as much the well wisher of your glory as of my own  clementina della porretta  letter xxxiv sir charles grandison to lady clementina rome aug    n s nothing says the most generous and pious of her sex but the due consideration of the brevity as well as vanity of this life and of the duration of the next could have influenced me to act against my heart  condescending goodness what acknowlegements do you make in my favor  but favor  can i say  no not in my favor but on the contrary to the extinction of all my hopes for what pleas remain to be urged when you doubt not my affection my gratitude my tenderness my good faith and think from them will arise your danger  my extricating hand at your command is held out and it shall not be my fault if you recover not the smooth and pleasant path in which you were accustomed to walk with undoubting feet  you bid me tell you what you shall do to be indifferent to me  what pain does the gracious manner of your rejection give me exalted goodness  your brother your friend your faithful your disinterested friend will tell you against himself to the forfeiture of all his hopes he will tell you that you ought not to give your hand as your heart condescending excellence would have directed if you cannot do it and think your soul secure  you will help me to words you say  i repeat them after you persevere clementina  i will not i cannot account you ungrateful  how much does the dear the generous clementina overrate the services which heaven for my consolation so i will flatter myself in a very heavy disappointment that was to follow made me an humble instrument of rendering to the worthiest of families to that heaven be all the glory by ascribing so much to the agent fear you not that you depreciate the first cause give to the supreme his due and what will be left for me to claim what but a common service which any one of your family would in the like circumstances have done for me  it is generous it is noble in you madam to declare your regard for the man you refuse but what a restraint must i act under who value and must for ever value the fair refuser yet think myself bound in honor to acqiesce with the refusal and to prefer your peace of mind to my own to lay open my heart before you would give you pain i will not give you pain yet let me say that the honor once designed me had it been conferred would have laid me under unreturnable obligations to as many persons as are of your family it was at one time an honor too great even for my ambition and that is one of the constitutional faults that i have found it most difficult to restrain but i will glory in their intended goodness and that i lost not their or your favor from any act of unworthiness  continue to me most excellent clementina continue to me lords and ladies of your illustrious house your friendship and i will endeavor to be satisfied  your tutor as you are pleased to call him your friend your brother too clearly do i see the exclusive force of that last recognition owns that he cannot be indifferent to those motives that have so great weight with you he sees your stedfastness and that your conscience is engaged he submits therefore whatever the submission may cost him to your reasoning and repeats your words  persevere clementina  i did tell your elder brother and i am ready to tell all the world that i would not in a beginning address though to a princess have signed to the articles i yielded to by way of compromise allow me madam to repeat his question to which my declaration was an answer  what would the daughters have done that they should have been consigned to perdition vol iii p       i had in my thoughts this further plea that our church admits of a possibility of salvation out of its own pale god forbid but it should the church of god we hold will be collected from the sincerely pious of all communions yet i own that had the intended honor been done me i should have rejoiced that none but sons had blessed our nuptials  but how do your next words affect me  compassion and love say you were equally perhaps your inducements  poor clementina add you inimitably great as what follows this is i should have thought myself concerned as well for my own honor as for your delicacy to have expatiated on the selfpitying reflection conveyed in these words had we been otherwise circumstanced than we are but to write but one half of what in happier circumstances i would have written must as i have hinted give pain to your noble heart the excellent clementina i am sure would not wish me to say much on this subject if she would i must not i cannot  the best of fathers mothers brothers and of spiritual directors in your own way are yours they madam will strengthen your mind their advices and their indulgent love will be your support in the resolution you have taken you call upon me again to approve of that resolution i do i must approve of it the lover of your soul concludes with the repetition of the words you prescribe to his pen  if cooler reflection if reconsideration of those arguments which persuaded me to hope that you would have been in no way unhappy or unsafe had you condescended to be mine  if mature and dispassionate thought cannot alter your present persuasion on this head  persevere clementina in the rejection of a man as steady in his own faith as you are in yours if your conscience is concerned  if your peace of mind is engaged  you ought to refuse you cannot be thought ungrateful  so against himself decides your calledupon and generously acknowleged  tutor friend brother grandison  letter xxxv lady clementina to sir charles grandison bologna aug    n s and do you best of men consent to be governed by my wishes but are you convinced you do not say you are by my reasonings  alas my reasoning powers are weakened my head has received an incurable wound my memory indeed seems returned but its return only serves to make me more sensible of my past unhappiness and to dread a relapse  but what is it i hear olivia is come back to florence and you are at florence fly from florence and from olivia  but whither will you go to avoid a woman who could follow you to england  whither but to england  we are all of us apprehensive for the safety of your person if you refuse to be the hushand of that violent woman yet cannot i bear the thoughts of her being yours but that you have told me she never can be  yet if you could be happy with her why should i be an enemy to her happiness  but to your own magnanimity i will leave this subject  let me advise with my tutor my friend my brother on a point that is now much more my concern than olivia and her hopes  fain very fain would i take the viel my heart is in it my friends my dearest friends urge against my plea the dying request as well as the wishes while living of my grandfathers on both sides i am distressed i am greatly distressed for well do i know what were the views of the two good men now with god in wishing me not to assume the viel but could they foresee the calamity that was to befall their clementina they could not i need not dwell upon the subject and upon the force of their pleas and mine to a man whose mind is capacious enough to take in the whole strength of both at once but you will add an obligation to the many you have already conferred upon me if you can join your weight to my pleas and make it your request that i may be obliged in this momentous article let me expect that you can that you will they all languish for opportunities to oblige the man who has laid them under obligations not to be returned need i to suggest a plea to you the force of which must be allowed from you if you ever with fervor loved clementina  if i know my own heart and i have given it a strict examination two things granted me would make me as happy as i now can be in this life the one that my request to be allowed to sequester myself from the world and to dedicate myself to god be complied with the other to be assured of your happiness in marriage with an english at least not to an italian woman i am obliged to own though i am sensible that i expose to you my weakness by the acknowlegement that the last is but too necessary to the tranquillity of my mind in the situation in which the grant of my first wish will please me let me know chevalier when i have set my hand to the plough that there is no looking back and that the only man i ever thought of with tenderness is anothers and were i not professed never could be mine answer as i wish and i shall be able to follow you sir with my prayers to the country that has the honor of producing such an ornament to human nature  it must not be known you will readily suppose that i have sought to interest you in my plea for this reason i have not shown this letter to anybody father marescotti i have hopes as a religious will declare himself in my favor if you do my brother the bishop surely will strengthen your hand and his though he appears as the brother not as the prelate in support of the family reasons  i am not ashamed to say i long to see you sir i can the more readily allow myself to tell you so as i can declare that i am unalterably determined in my adherence to my written resolution never to trust to my own strength in an article in which my everlasting welfare is concerned o sir what struggles what conflicts did this resolution cost me before i could make it  but once made and upon such deliberation and after i had begged of god his direction which i imagine he has graciously given me i have never wished to alter it forgive me sir you will you are a good man  my god only have i preferred to you  clementina della porretta  letter xxxvi sir charles grandison to lady clementina florence aug    n s my dear correspondent asks if i am convinced by her reasonings  i repeat that i resign to your will every hope every wish respecting myself in a case where conscience can be pleaded no other reasonings are necessary  but what can i say most excellent of women to the request you make that i will support you in your solicitude to take the veil i hope you only propose this to me by way of asking my advice  let me say you advise with my tutor my friend my brother  i have given the highest instance that man could give of my disinterestedness and i will now as you require suppose myself a catholic in the humble advice i shall offer to my sisterly friend and this will the rather appear as i should as a protestant argue against any ones binding him or herself by vows of perpetual celibacy  need i asks my dear correspondent suggest a plea for you to make the force of which must be allowed if ever you fervently loved clementina at what plea does the excellent clementina hint is it not at an herodian one herod directed that his mariamne should be put to death that she might not be the wife of any other man if he returned not alive from the court of augustus caesar before whom he was cited to answer for his conduct which had been obnoxious to that prince in the contest between him and antony for the empire of the world  why if ever she honored her grandison with her esteem does she not enforce the same plea with regard to him can she avowing the esteem be so generous as to wish him to enter into the married state and even to insist upon it as a step that would contribute to her future peace of mind yet hope to prevail upon him to make it his request that she may be secluded from a possibility of ever enjoying the same liberty were i married and capable of wishing to fetter and restrain thus my wife in case of her surviving me i should think she ought to despise me for the narrowness of my heart what then is the plea that a young lady in the bloom of beauty would put me upon making  and to whom  to her own relations who all languish as she expresses herself for opportunities to oblige him and who are extremely earnest to dissuade her from entering upon the measure she wishes him to promote can he madam to use your own words in the solemn paper you give me think of taking such advantage of their generosity to him  but can clementina della porretta who is blessed with the tenderest and most indulgent of parents and who has always gloried in her duty to them whose brothers love her with a disinterestedness that hardly any brothers before them have been able to show can she in opposition to the will of her grandfathers wish to enter into a measure that must frustrate all their hopes from her for ever  dear lady consider  you my beloved correspondent who hold marriage as a sacrament surely cannot doubt but you may serve god in it with much greater efficacy than were you to sequester yourself from a world that wants such an example as you are able to give it but madam your parents propose not marriage to you they only at present beseech not command you they know the generosity of your heart not to take a step that must entirely frustrate all their hopes and put an option out of your own power should you change your mind let me advise you madam disclaiming all interested views and from motives of a love merely fraternal for such is your expectation from the man you honor with your correspondence to set the hearts of relations so justly dear to you at ease and to leave to providence the issue they never madam will compel you and give me leave to say that piety requires this of you does not the almighty everywhere in his word sanctify the reasonable commands of parents does he not interest himself if i may so express myself in the performance of the silial duty may it not be justly said that to obey your parents is serve god would the generous the nobleminded clementina della porretta narrow as i may say her piety by limiting it i speak now as if i were a catholic and as if i thought there were some merit in secluding ones self from the world when she could at least equally serve god and benefit her own soul by obeying her parents by fulfilling the will of her deceased grandfathers and by obliging all her other near and dear relations lady clementina cannot resolve all the world into herself shall i say there is often cowardice there is selfishness and perhaps in the worlds eye a too strong consession of disappointment in such seclusions  there are about you persons who can give this argument its full force  i cannot do it o my clementina my sister my friend i cannot be so great so undivested in this instance as you can be  but i can be just i presume to say i cannot be ungenerous i tell you not what i hope to be enabled by your noble example in time to do because of the present tenderness of your health but you must not madam expect from me a conduct that you think it would become you to disavow delicate as the female mind is and as is most particularly my dear correspondents that of the man on such an occasion as this should show at least an equal delicacy for has he not her honor as a woman to protect as well as his own as a man to regard  distress me not my dear clementina add not i should rather say to my distress by the declaration of yours i repeat that your parents will not compel you put it not out of your power to be prevailed upon to do an act of duty god requires not that you should be dead to your friends in order to live to him their hope is laudable will lady clementina della porretta put it out even of the almightys power to bless their hope will she think herself unhappy if she cannot punish them instead of rewarding them for all their tender and indulgent goodness to her  it cannot be god almighty perfect his own work so happily begun in the full restoration of your health this blessing i have no doubt will attend your filial obedience but can you my dear correspondent expect it if you make yourself uneasy and keep your mind in suspense as to your duty and indulge yourself in supposing that the will of god and the will of your parents are opposite when theirs is solely designed for your good spiritual and temporal a great deal now depends upon yourself o madam will you not in a smaller instance were your heart ever so much engaged to the cloistered life practice that selfdenial which in the highest you enforce upon me all your temporal duties against you and your spiritual not favoring much less impelling you  but once more i quit a subject that may and no doubt will be enforced in a much stronger manner than i can enforce it i will soon very soon pay my duty to you and all yours you own your wishes to see me because you are fortified by your invincible adherence to your resolution i will acknowledge anguish of heart i cannot as i told you above be so great as you but if you will permit your sisterly love to have its full operation and if you wish me peace of mind and a cordial resignation to your will let me see you madam on the next visit i shall have the honor to make you cheerful serene and determined to resign your will to the reasonable will of parents who i am confident i again repeat it will never compel you to marry  have they not already given you a very strong instance that they will not  in a word let me hear you declare that you will resign yourself to their will in this article of the veil and i shall then with the more cheerfulness endeavor to resign to yours so strongly and repeatedly declared in the letter before me to dear lady  your fraternal friend and everobliged servant grandison lady olivia madam arrived this day at her own palace it is impossible that anything but civility can pass between her and your greatlyfavoured correspondent    letter xxxvii sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna thursday aug      i shall hereafter have a pretty large supplement to give you to my literary journal having found it necessary as much as possible in the past month to amuse myself with subjects without myself and i shall send you now the copies of three letters of mine written in italian to lady clementina and two of hers in answer to the first and second of them  i arrived here yesterday but before i proceed to acquaint you with my reception i should mention that lady olivia arrived at her own place at florence on friday last i was then in that city but newly returned from naples and rome she sent one of her gentlemen to me the night of her arrival to acquaint me with it and to desire me to attend her next morning i went  her first reception of me was polite and agreeable but the moment her aunt maffei withdrew and we were alone her eyes darting a fiercer ray wretch said she what disturbance what anxieties have thou given me  but it is well that thy ingratitude to the creature who has risqued so much for thee has been rewarded as it ought to be by a repulse from a still prouder heart if possible than thy own  you lady olivia answered i have reason to impute pride to me you have given me many opportunities to show you that i a man can keep my temper when you a woman have not been able to keep yours yet in me never met with an aggressor  not an aggressor sir  to say nothing of the contempts you cast upon me here in my own italy what was your treatment of me in your england  paltry island i despise it  to resolve to leave me there to refuse to compliment me with a day an hour o my detested weakness what a figure did i make among your friends and declaredly to attend the motions of the haughtiest woman in europe thank god for your own sake yes sir i have the charity to say for your own sake that you are disappointed  i pity you lady olivia from my soul i pity you and should abhor myself were i capable of mingling insult with my pity but i leave you  forgive me chevalier catching my arm as i was going i am more displeased with myself than with you a creature that has rendered herself so cheap to you but sir it is only to you cannot but be uneasy to herself and when she is she must misbehave to everybody else say you forgive me   she held out her hand to me but immediately on lady maffeis coming in followed by servants withdrew it  her behavior afterward was that of the true passionate woman now ready to rave now in tears i cannot dr bartlett descend to particulars a man who loves the sex who has more compassion than vanity in his nature who can value even generally faulty persons for the qualities that are laudable in them must be desirous to draw a veil over the weaknesses of such i left her distressed there may be cases in which sincerity cannot be separated from unpoliteness i was obliged to be unpolite or i could not have been sincere and must have given such answers as would perhaps in some measure have entitled the lady to think herself amused poor woman she threatened to have me overtaken by her vengeance but now on the disappointment i had met with at bologna it became absolutely necessary for me to encourage or to discourage this unhappy lady  i could not have been just to her had i not been just to myself  a very extraordinary attempt was made next day on my person i am apt to believe from this quarter it succeeded not and as i was on the tuesday to set out for bologna i let it pass off without complaint or enquiry  i paid the count of belvedere a visit as i had promised the general at naples and the count at parma received me with the highest civilities and both from the same motive the count will hope the general accompanied me with his lady part of my way to florence the motive of his journey is to rejoice personally with his friends at urbino and bologna on the resolution his sister has taken and to congratulate her upon it as he has already done by letter the copy of which he showed me there were high compliments made me in it we may speak handsomely of the man whom we neither envy nor fear he would have loaded me with presents but i declined accepting any in such a manner however as he could not be dissatisfied with me for my refusal  i paid also my respects at urbino to the altieri family and the conte della porretta in my way to rome and naples and met with a very polite reception from both for the rest of the time of my absence from bologna my literary journal will account  on wednesday afternoon i went to the palace of porretta i hastened up to my jeronymo with whom as also with mr lowther i had held a correspondence in my absence and received favorable intelligences from them  jeronymo rejoiced to see me i was inexpressibly delighted to find him so much recovered his appetite he told me was restored his rest was balmy and refreshing he sat up several hours in the day and his sister and he gave joy to each other and to all their friends but he hinted to me his wishes still to call me brother and begged of god in a very earnest manner snatching my hand and wetting it with his tears that it still might be so  the marquis the marchioness the bishop and father marescotti joined to thank and applaud me for my part of the correspondence with their beloved daughter for on my declining to support her in her wishes to be allowed to take the veil she had showed them the copy of her second letter as well as my reply to it the blessings which they poured out upon me were mingled with their tears and father marescotti and the bishop declared that they would in every prayer they put up to heaven for themselves and the family remember me and beg of god to supply to me by another and even they said a better clementina the disappointment i had so unexpectedly met with from theirs the general and his lady and the count arrived the day before but they were not present  while they were all complimenting and applauding the almost silent man for in so critical a situation what could i say camilla came in and whispering the marchioness clementina said the marchioness is impatient to see her friend chevalier i will introduce you i followed her  the young lady the moment she beheld me flew to me with open arms as to her brother her fourth brother as she called me and thanked me she said a thousand thousand times for my letters to her my mamma said she has seen them all but ah sir your third  i did not think you would have refused me your interest with my friends i cannot cannot give up that point it was always my wish madam turning to her mother to be gods child that does not make me less yours and my papas o chevalier you have not quieted you have not convinced my heart  i promise myself that i could have left you without a plea my dear correspondent returned i had my heart been at ease and the argument less affecting to myself and surely if lady clementina had been convinced she would have acted up to her conviction  o sir you are a dangerous man i see if a certain event had taken place i should have been a lost creature  are not you sir convinced that i should in my notions of a lost creature if you are i hope you will act up to your conviction  was this necessary to be said to me i think on recollection she halfsmiled when she said it  my dear dr bartlett you see clementina could be pleasant on an occasion so solemn  but perhaps she saw me only affectedly cheerful little at present as she imagines it i think it not impossible that she may in time be brought to yield to the sense of her duty laid down by such powerful advocates as she has in her own family whatever happens may it be happy to her and this family and then i cannot be wholly joyless what is there in this life worth  but let me not be too abstracted this world if we can enjoy it with innocent cheerfulness and be serviceable to our fellow creatures is not to be despised even by a philosopher  i hope madam said i to her that at least you suspend your wishes after the sequestered life she allowed the force of one or two of my arguments but i could perceive that she gave not up her hope of being complied with in her wishes to assume the veil  the general and his lady and the count being come in hastened up to pay their compliments to me how profuse were the two gentlemen in theirs  at the marchionesss motion we went to jeronymo and found the marquis the bishop and father marescotti coming to us and then every one joining in their acknowlegements of obligation to me and wishing it in their power to make me as happy as they declared i had made them i said it was in their power i hoped to do me an unspeakable pleasure  they called upon me as with one voice it is answered i that my dear friend jeronymo may be prevailed upon to accompany me to england mr lowther would think himself very happy in his attendance on him there rather than to stay here and yet if my request should not be granted he is determined not to leave him till he is supposed to be out of danger  they looked upon one another with eyes of pleasure and surprise jeronymo wept i cannot cannot bear said he such a weight of obligation grandison we can do nothing for you and you have brought me your lowther to heal me that you might have the killing of me yourself  clementinas eyes were filled with tears she went from us with some little precipitation  o chevalier said the marchioness my clementinas heart is too susceptible for its own ease to impressions of gratitude you will quite kill the poor child  or make her repent her resolution  what is there but favor to me replied i if my request can be complied with i hope my dear jeronymo will not be unattended by others of his friends i have had the promises of the two young lords our baths are restorative i will attend you to them my dear jeronymo the difference of air of climate may probably be tried with advantage let me have the honor of entertaining you in england looking all round me and that i will consider as a full return of the obligations you think so highly of and are so solicitous to discharge  they looked upon one another in silence  would to god proceeded i that you my lord and you madam directing myself to the father and mother would honor me as my guests for one season  you once had thoughts of it had a certain happy event taken place  i dare promise you both after the fatigues you have undergone a renewal of health from our salutary springs i should be but too happy if in such company a sister might be allowed to visit a brother  but if this be thought too great a favor that sister in your absence cannot but give and receive pleasure sometimes in visiting mrs beaumont at florence sometimes her brother and his lady at naples and i will engage my two sisters and their lords to accompany me in my attendance on you back to bologna my sisters will be delighted with the opportunity of visiting italy and of paying their respects to a young lady whose character they revere and to whom once their brother had hoped to give them the honor of a relation  they still continuing silent but none of them seeming displeased you will by such a favor my dear lords and you madam to the marchioness do me credit with myself as i may say i shall return to my native country if i go alone after the hopes you had all given me like a disappointed and rejected man my pride as well as my pleasure is concerned on this occasion my house in the country my house in london shall be yours i will be either inmate or visiter at your pleasure no man loves his country better than i do but you will induce me to love it still better if by your compliance with my earnest request you shall be able to obtain either health or pleasure from a twelvemonths residence in it oblige me my dear lords oblige me madam were it but to give yourselves a new relish to your own country and palace on your return our summers have not your fervid sun our commerce gives us in the highest perfection all your justly boasted autumnal fruits nor are our winters so cold as yours oblige me for the approaching winter only and stay longer as you shall find inclination  dearest grandison said jeronymo i will accept of your invitation the moment i am told that i may undertake the journey   the journey my lord interrupted i  your cabin shall be made near as convenient to you as your chamber you shall be set ashore within half a league of my house in london god give us a pleasant voyage and in a few days time you will not know except by amended health and spirits that you are not in this your own chamber  surely said the general my sister was right in her apprehensions that she should not be able to continue a catholic had she been this mans i wish you my lord you madam and jeronymo would go you have had a long course of fatigues and troubles you love the chevalier winter with him however i have heard much of the efficacy of the english baths clementina must not go my wife and i will make her as happy as possible in your absence and take grandison at his word bring him and his sisters back with you their lords i understand have been among us they will not be sorry to visit italy a second time as no doubt they are men of taste  but when chevalier do you think of going  the sooner the better were it but to take advantage of the fine season it will be but what mariners call a trip to england you will make me very happy you can have no other way of discharging the obligations you are so sollicitous about i will return with you the health of lady clementina i flatter myself will be quite confirmed by that time signor jeronymo i hope will be restored likewise what joy shall we be enabled to give one another   they took only till the morning to consult and give me an answer  letter xxxviii sir charles grandison in continuation mr lowther and his colleagues having been consulted gave it as their opinion that jeronymo might be removed by litter to the nearest seaport and there embark for england but that it is most eligible to stay till the next spring by which time they hope the two old wounds may be safely cicatrized and the new one only kept open  but they all engaged that then not only jeronymo and the two young lords but some others of the family will be my guests in england and in the mean time that the bishop and father marescotti will in turn correspond with me and acquaint me with all that passes here  clementina drank chocolate with us she had been made acquainted with their determination and approved of the promises of a visit to be made me next year by some of the principals of the family what a hard circumstance is it whispered she as she sat next me that the person who would be most willing to go and i flatter myself would not be the least welcome must not be of the company i should have been glad to have made one visit to the country where the chevalier grandison was born  and what a perverseness thought i is there in custom that would not permit this kind explicitness in lady clementina were she not determined to consider the brother in the man before her rather than a still nearer relation by how many ways my dear dr bartlett may delicate minds express a denial  negatives need not to be frowningly given nor affirmatives blushingly pronounced  jeronymo and i being left alone he challenged me on the visible concern which he and every one as he said saw in my countenance on the turn his sister had taken had it not been in my heart he was sure it would not have been there  can you wonder at it my dear friend said i when i came over greatly as i thought of your sister i did not think she had been so great as she has shown herself i admired her ever but i now more than admire her taught to hope as i was and so unexpectedly disappointed as i have been i must have been more than man were i not very much affected  no doubt but you must and i am cordially concerned for your concern but my dear grandison it is only god that she prefers to you she suffers more than you can do she has no other way she assures me to comfort herself but by indulging her hopes that she shall not live long  dear creature she flatters herself that her reason is restored in answer to her fervent supplications which she says she put up to heaven in all her lucid intervals that for the sake of her parents and brothers it might be restored and that then she might be taken to the arms of mercy but if your heart be deeply affected my grandison   it is jeronymo i am not an insensible man but should now our dear clementina be prevailed upon to descend from the height to which she has soared however my wishes might be gratified by the condescension yet while she believed her conscience would be wounded by it i could not but think it would be some diminution to her glory and how as she has hinted in one of her letters to me would it be possible were i to see my beloved wife unhappy with her scruples to forbear endeavoring to quiet her mind by removing them and could this be effected without giving her an opinion of the religion i profess in opposition to hers and would not that subject me to a breach of articles o my dear jeronymo matters must stand just as they do except she could think more favorably of my religion and less favorably of her own  he began to talk of their obligations to me i declared that they could no other way give me pain do not said i let this subject ever be again mentioned by you or any of the family every one my dear jeronymo is not called upon by the occasion as i have had the happiness to be would my friend envy me this happiness  i wish dr bartlett with all my heart that i could think of any thing that i could accept of to make such grateful spirits easy it pains me to be placed by them in such a superior light as must give them pain what my dear dr bartlett can i do consistent with my notions of friendship to make their hearts easy  he was afraid he said that i should now soon think of leaving them  i told him that having no doubt of lady clementinas perseverance in her resolution and of her leave to return to my native country i should be glad for my own sake as well as the ladys to be allowed to depart in a few days mr lowther as it would make jeronymo as he had declared more easy would stay behind me but dismiss him my friend said i as soon as you can he had obtained abroad a happy competency and was returned to england when i first knew him with intent to enjoy it he is as rich as he wants to be and can gratisy only the natural benevolence of his heart by attending my dear friend i hope to get him to accept of apartments with me in my london house and to fix his retirement if not with me in my paternal seat in its neighborhood at least he has merit that is not confined to his profession but for what he has done for my jeronymo he will always hold a prime place in my heart  it is true dr bartlett and i please myself that he will be found as worthy of your friendly love and my beauchamps as of mine if i can at last be indulged in my long long hopedfor wish of settling in my native country with some tolerable tranquillity of mind i shall endeavor to draw around me such a ollection of worthies as shall make my neighborhood one of the happiest spots in britain  the marchioness came up to us clementina said she is apprehensive that you soon will leave us her father and brothers are walking with her in the garden they will i dare say be glad of your company  i left jeronymo and his mother together and joined the marquis the general the bishop and clementina the generals lady and father marescotti were in another ally in earnest conversation  the marquis made me a high compliment and after a few turns the prelate led off his father and brother and left clementina and me alone together  were you not cruel chevalier said she in your last lettet to me not only to deny me your weight in the request my heart was and is still set upon but to strengthen their arguments against me great use have some of my friends made of what you wrote o sir you have won the heart of giacomo but you have contributed to oppress that of his sister indeed indeed i cannot be easy if i am denied the veil  dear lady clementina remember that the full establishment of your health depends under god upon the quiet of your own mind give not way i beseech you to uneasy apprehensions what daughter may rely upon the indulgence of a father and mother what sister upon the affection of brothers if you may not upon yours you have seen how much their happiness depends upon your health would you doubt the efficacy of that piety while you are in the world of which you have already shall i say to my cost given an instance so glorious to yourself that the sufferer by it cannot help applauding you for it  o chevalier say not at your cost if you wish me to be easy  with the utmost difficulty have i restrained and do i restrain myself on these occasions i must however add on this a few words you have obliged me madam to give one of the greatest instances of selfdenial that ever was given by man let me beseech you dearest lady clementina for your own sake for the sake of your duty as well to the departed as to the living and may i add for my sake that you would decline this now favorite wish of your heart  she paused and at last said well sir i see i must not expect any favor from you on this subject let us turn into that shaded ally and now sir as to the other part of my request to you in my last letter  it was not a request made on undeliberate motives  what is that madam  how shall i say it  yet i will  if chevalier you would banish from my heart  again she stopped i thought not at that moment of what she meant  if you would make me easy   madam   you must marry  then sir shall i not doubt of my adhering to my resolution but say not a word till i have told you that the lady must be an english woman she must not be an italian olivia would not scruple to change her religion for you but olivia must not be yours you could not be happy ipersuade myself with olivia do you think you could  i bowed in confirmation of her opinion  i thought you could not let not clementina be disgraced in your choice of a wife i have a proud heart let it not be said that the man of whom clementina della porretta thought with distinction undervalued himself in marriage  this dr bartlett was a request of the same generous import that she mentioned in her resverie before i left italy how consistently delicate she had tears in her eyes as she spoke i was too much affected with her generosity to interrupt her  if you marry sir i shall perhaps be allowed to be one in the party that will make you a visit in england my sisterinlaw has within this hour wished to be one she will endeavor to prevail upon her lord he can deny her nothing to accompany her you will be able to induce mrs beaumont once more to visit her native country you and your lady and perhaps your sisters and their lords will return with us thus shall we be as one family if i am not to be obliged in another wish i must in this and this must be in your power and will you not make me easy  admirable clementina who can be so great as you such tenderness as i read in your eyes such magnanimity never before met in woman you can do everything that is noble  but that very greatness of soul attaches me to you and makes it at least while i am an admiring witness of your excellence   hush chevalier not a word more on this subject it affects me more than i wish it did i am aftaid i am chargeable with affectation  but you must however marry i shall not be easy while you are unmarried  when i know it is not possible to be  but no more of this subject now  how long is it that we are to have you among us  if i have no hopes madam   dear chevalier speak not in this strain  she turned her face from me  the sooner the better  but your pleasure madam   i thank you sir  but did i not tell you that i have pride chevalier  ah sir you have long ago found it out pride will do greater things for women than reason can  let us walk to that seat and i will tell you more of my pride  she sat down and making me sit by her  i will talk to these myrtles fancifully said she turning her head from me shall the chevalier grandison be acquainted with the weakness of thy heart clementina  shall he in compassion to thy weakness leave his native country and come over to thee  shall the success that has attended his generous effort show his power to the confirmation of thy weakness  shall thou enabled by the divine goodness to take a resolution becoming they character be doubtful whether thou can adhere to it and give him room to think thee doubtful  shall he in consequence of this doubtfulness make officious absences to try thy strength of mind  and shall thou fail in the trial his compassionate generosity puts thee to  no clementina  then turning to me with a downcast eye  i thank you sir for all the instances of generous compassion you have shown me my unhappy disorder had entitled me in some measure to it it was the hand of god perhaps a punishment for my pride and i submit to it nor am i ashamed to acknowledge the kindness of your compassion to me i will retain a grateful sense of it to the last hour of my life i wish to be remembered by you with tenderness to the last hour of yours i may not live long i will therefore yield to your request so earnestly made and to the wishes of my dearest friends in suspending at least my own i will hope to see you in the happy state i have hinted at in england and afterward in italy i will suppose you of my family i will suppose myself of yours on these suppositions in these hopes i can part with you as if i live it will be a temporary parting only an absence of a few months and have i not behaved well for the whole last month and several days over though i reckoned to myself the time as it passed more than once every day as so much elapsed and nearer to the time of your return  i own it blushing  and now sir i return to you the option you offered me be the day the solemn day at your nomination  your sister clementina will surrender you up to her sisters and yours  o sir listing up her eyes to me and beholding an emotion in me which i tried to conceal but could not how good how compassionate how affectionate you are  but name to me now your day this seat when you are far far distant from me shall be a seat consecrated to the remembrance of your tenderness i will visit it every day nor shall the summers sun nor the winters frost keep me from it  it will be best taking her hand admirable lady it will be best for us both for me i am sure it will that the solemn day be early next monday morning let me set out  sunday evening  the day on my part shall be a day passed in imploring health happiness and every blessing on my dearest clementina on our jeronymo and their whole family and for a happy meeting to us all in england  sunday evening if you please i will  i could not speak out the sentence  she burst into tears reclined her face on my shoulder  her bosom heaved  and she sobbed out  oh chevalier  must must  but be it  be it so  and god almighty strengthen the minds of both  the marchioness who was coming toward us saw at distance the emotion of her beloved daughter and fearing she was sainting hastened to her and clasping her arms about her  my child my clementina said she  why these streaming eyes look upon me love  ah madam the day the day is set  next monday  the chevalier will leave bologna  god forbid  chevalier you will not so soon leave us my dear we will prevail upon the chevalier   i arose and walked into a cross alley from them i was greatly affected  o dr bartlett these good women  why have i a heart so susceptible yet such demands upon it for fortitude  the general the bishop and father marescotti came to me i briefly recounted to them the substance of the conversation that had passed between lady clementina and me the marquis joined his lady and daughter and clementina in her tender way gave her father and mother an account of the same  the marquis and his lady leaving her to her camilla joined us o chevalier said the marquis how can we think of parting with you  and so soon  you will not so suddenly leave us  not if lady clementina commands the contrary if she do not the sooner the better it will be for me i cannot bear her generous excellence she is the most exalted of women  see the dear lady before us leaning on her camilla as if she wanted support  my sister and you chevalier said the general will no doubt correspond we shall none of us deny her that liberty as she has already expressed to you her wishes that you would marry may we not hope that you will try your influence over her upon the same subject in your future letters the marriage of either will answer the end she proposes to herself by urging yours  good heaven thought i  do they believe me absolutely divested of human passions  i have been at continual war as you know dr bartlett with the most ungovernable of mine but without wishing to overcome the tender susceptibilities which properly directed are the glory of the human nature  this is too much to be asked said the young marchioness how can this be expected  you know not madam said the bishop supporting his brothers wishes what the chevalier grandison can do to make a whole family happy though against himself  lady clementina said the equally unfeeling though good father marescotti thinks she is under the divine direction in the resolution she has taken this world and all its glories are but of second consideration with her were it to cost her her life i am confident she would not alter it as therefore the chevalier can have no hopes   i cannot ask this said the marquis you see how hard a task referring to me  o that the great obstacle could be removed my dear grandison taking my hand cannot cannot  but i dare not ask  if it could my own sons would not be more dear to me than you  my lord you honor me you engage my utmost gratitude it is with difficulty that i am able to adhere to my engagement not to press her to be mine when i have the honor to be with her i have wished her to resign her will to that of her father and mother as you have seen knowing the consequence i am persuaded that if either were to marry the other would be more easy in mind and i had much rather follow her example than set her one  you will see what my return to my native country will do for us both but she must not be precipitated if she is her wishes to take the veil may be resumed punctilio will join with her piety and if not complied with she may then again be unhappy  they agreed to follow my advice to have patience and leave the issue to time  i left them and went to jeronymo i communicated to him what had passed and the early day i had named for setting out on my return to england this i did with as much tenderness as possible yet his concern was so great upon it that it added much to mine and i was forced with some precipitation to quit his chamber and the house and to retire to my lodgings in order to compose myself  and thus my dear dr bartlett is the day of my setting out fixed i hope i shall not be induced to alter it mrs beaumont i know will excuse me going back to florence olivia must i hope she will i shall write to both  i shall take my route through modena parma placentia lady sforza has desired an interview with me i hope she will meet me at pavia or turin if not i will attend her at milan i promised to pay her a visit before i quitted italy but as her request to see me was made while it was thought there might have been a relation between us i suppose the interview now can mean nothing but civility i hope if i see her her cruel daughter will not be present  letter xxxix sir charles grandison in continuation parma monday night aug    monday night sept   here i am my dear dr bartlett just arrived  the count of belvedere allows me to be alone i am not fit for company  the whole family jeronymo and clementina excepted dined with me on saturday clementina was not well enough to leave her chamber she would endeavor she said on sunday right when i was to take my leave of them all to behave with as much presence of mind as she did on a former occasion all the intervenient time she said was necessary to fortify her heart but alas the circumstances between us then and now were not the same we had for some time past been allowedly too dear to each other to appear either of us so politely distant as we did then  she never once asked me to suspend the day of my departure every one else repeatedly did we both thought it best as the separation was necessary that it should not be suspended  i had many things to do many letters to write much to say to mr lowther and he to me i declined therefore their invitation to attend them home in the evening as well as to dine with them next day the solemn visit was to be made yesterday in the evening and every visit near the time would have been as so many farewels my own heart at least told me so and forbad me more than one parting scene the time so near they themselves wished it past  the count had come from urbino on purpose with the two young lords to take leave of me what blessings did that nobleman and the marquis and marchioness invoke upon me the general had more than once tears in his eyes he besought me to forgive him for everything in his behavior that had been disagreeable to me his lady permitted me to take leave of her in the most affectionate manner and said that she hoped to prevail on her lord to visit me himself and to allow her to bear him company in my own country the bishop supplicated heaven to reward me for what he called my goodness to their family father marescotti joined in his supplications with a bent knee the marquis and marchioness both wept and called me by very endearing names vowing everlasting love and gratitude to me jeronymo my dear jeronymo one of the most amiable of men how precious to my soul will ever be the remembrance of his friendly love his only consolation was and it is mine that in a few months we shall meet in england they wanted to load me with presents they pained me with their importunities that i would accept of some very valuable ones they saw my pain and in pity to me declined their generous solicitations  clementina was not present at this parting scene she had shut herself up for the greatest part of the day her mother and her sisterinlaw had been her only visiters and she having declared that she was afraid of seeing me it was proposed to me whether it were not best for me to depart without seeing her i can well spare to myself said i the emotions which already so great will on taking leave of her be too powerful for my heart if you think that when i am gone she will not wish as once she was so earnest even to discomposure for a farewell visit that she had allowed herself to see me  they all were then of opinion that she should be prevailed upon camilla at that instant came down with her ladys desire that i would attend her in what way camilla is my clementina asked the marchioness everyone attending the answer in great grief madam almost in agonies she was sending me down with her warmest wishes to the chevalier and with her excuses but called me back saying she would subdue herself she would see him and bid me hasten for fear he should be gone  the two marchionesses went up directly i was in tremors surely thought i i am the weakest of men  the bishop and general took notice of my emotion and pitied me they all joined in the wish so often repeated that i could yet be theirs  i followed camilla lady clementina when i entered sat between the mother and sister an arm round each of their necks her face was reclined as if she were ready to faint on the bosom of her mother who held her salts to her i was halfway in the room before either mother or daughter saw me the chevalier grandison my best sister said the young marchioness look up my love  she reaised her head then stood up courtesied and gushing into tears turned her face from me  i approached her her mother gave me the hand of her clementina  comfort her comfort my clementina good chevalier  you only can  sit down my love take my seat sir  the young lady trembled she sat down her mother seated herself tears in her eyes i sat down by clementina the dear lady sobbed and the more as she endeavored to suppress her emotion  i addressed myself to her sisterinlaw who had kept her seat  your ladyship said i gives me a very high pleasure in the hope of seeing you and your lord a few months hence in company with my jeronymo what a blessing is it to us all that that dear friend is so well recovered i have no doubt but change of climate and our salutary springs will do wonders for him let us by our patience and resignation entitle ourselves to greater blessings the consequence as i hope of those we have already received  please god i will see you in england chevalier said the young marchioness if my lord is in the least favorable to my wishes and i hope my beloved sister may be of the party you madam and the marquis i hope  looking at her motherinlaw  i hope you will not go without us my dear replied the marchionss if our dear clementina shall be well we will not leave her behind us  ah madam  ah sir  said clementina how you flatter me but this this night if the chevalier goes early in the morning is the last time i shall ever see him  god forbid replied i  i hope that we may many many years rejoice in each others friendship let us look forward with what pleasure we may my heart madam wants your comfortings i have a greater opinion of your magnanimity than i have reason to have of my own i depart not but in consequence of your will  enable me by your example to sustain that consequence in everything you must be an example to me i could not have done as you have done bid me support my spirits in the hope of seeing you again and seeing you happy tell me that your endeavors shall not be wanting to be so and i shall then be so too dear lady clementina my happiness is bound up with yours  ah sir i am not greater than you and i am less than myself i was afraid when i came to the trial  but is your happiness bound up with mine o that i may be happy for your sake i will endeavor to make myself so you have given me a motive best of men how much am i obliged to you will you cherish my remembrance will you forgive all my foibles  the trouble i have given you  i know you depart in consequence of my  perverseness  perhaps you think it though you will not call so  what shall i do if you think me either perverse or ungrateful  i do not i cannot think you either may i be assured of your correspondence madam your ladyship turning to her mother will give it your countenance   by all means answered the marchioness we shall all correspond with you we shall pray for you and bless you every day that we live you will be to me as you have always been a fourth son  my dearest clementina say if your mind is changed if it be likely to change if you think that you shall not be happy if the chevalier   o madam permit me to withdraw for one moment  she hurried to her closet she shut the door and poured out her soul in prayer and soon returning  it must be so  with an air of asamed greatness let thy steadiness o grandison excuse and keep mine in countenance  bear witness my sister forgive me my mamma but never did one mortal love another as i do the man before us but you both and you my dear chevalier know the competition and shall not the unseen casting up her eyes surcharged with tears be greater with me than the seen be you my brother my friend and the lover of my soul this person is unworthy of you the mind that animates it is broken disturbed  pray for me as i will for you   then dropping down on one knee god preserve and convert thee best of protestants and worthiest of men guide thy footsteps and bless thee in thy future and better lot but if the woman whom thou shall distinguish by thy choice loves thee not person and mind as well as she before thee she deserves thee not  i would have raised her but she would not be raised  seeming full of some other great sentiments i kneeled to her clasping my arms about her may you madam be ever ever happy  i resign to your will  and equally admire and reverence you for it though a sufferer by it lasting as fervent be our friendship  and may we know each other hereafter in a place where all is harmony and love where no difference in opinion can sunder as now persons otherwise formed to promote each others happiness  i raised her and arose and kissing first one hand then the other and bowing to the two marchionesses was hastening from her  she clapped her hands together  he is gone  o stay stay chevalier  and will you go   i was in too much emotion to wish to be seen  she hastened after me to the stairs  o stay stay i have not said half i had to say   i returned and taking her hand bowed upon it to conceal my sensibility  what further commands with a faltering voice has lady clementina for her grandison  i dont know  but will you must you will you go  i go i stay i have no will but yours madam  the two marchionesses stood together rapt in silent attention leaning on each other  clementina sighed sobbed wept then turning from me then toward me but not withdrawing her hand i thought said she i had a thousand things to say  but i have lost them all  go thou in peace and be happy and god almighty make me so adieu dearest of men  she condescendingly inclined her cheek to me i saluted her but could not utter to her what yet was upon my lips to speak  she withdrew her hand she seemed to want support her mother and sister hastened to her i stopped at the door her eyes pursued my motions by her uplifted hands she seemed praying for me i was apprehensive of her fainting i hastened toward her but restraining myself just as i had reached her again hurried to the door and on my knees with clasped hands audibly there besought god to sustain support preserve the noble clementina and seeing her seated in the arms of both ladies i withdrew to mr lowthers apartment and shut myself in for a few moments when a little recovered i could not but step in to my jeronyme he was alone drying his eyes as he sat but seeing me enter he burst out into fresh tears once more my jeronymo  i would have comforted him but wanted comfort myself  o my grandison embracing me as i did him   clementina the angel clementina ah my jeronymo  grief again denied me further speech for a moment i saw that my emotion increased his  love love said i the dear  i would have added clementina but my trembling lips refused distinct utterance to the word  i tore myself from his embrace and with precipitation left the tenderest of friends  about eleven according to the english numbering of the hours i sent to know how the whole family did father marescotti returned with my servant he told me that the lady fainted away after i was gone but went to rest as soon as recovered they all were in grief he said he was charged with the best wishes and with the blessings of every one with those of the two marchionesses in particular signor jeronymo was so ill that one of his italian surgeons proposed to fit up with him all night for mr lowther had desired to accompany me as far as modena and him i charged with my compliments to each person of the family and with my remembrances to servants who well deserved kindness from me and who father marescotti told me were all in tears on my departure i prevailed on the father himself to make my acknowlegements to the good camilla he offered and i thankfully accepted of his prayers for my health and happiness which he put up in the most servent manner on his knees and then embracing me with a tenderness truly paternal we parted blessing each other  this morning early i set out the count of belvedere rejoiced to see me and called me kind for being his guest though but for one night for i shall pursue my journey in the morning he assures me that he will make me a visit in england  you will hardly till i arrive at paris have another letter my dear dr bartlett from  your everaffectionate charles grandison  letter xl sir charles grandison to dr bartlett paris aug    paris sept    i set out from parma early on tuesday morning as i intended the count of belvedere was so obliging as to accompany me to pavia where we parted with mutual civilities  i paid my respects to lady sforza at milan as i had promised she received me with great politeness our conversation chiefly turned on the differences between the other branches of her family on one part and herself and lady laurana on the other she owned that when she sent to desire a visit from me she had supposed that the alliance between them and me was a thing concluded upon and that she intended by my mediation to reconcile herself to the family if they would meet her halfway  she was so indiscreet as they lay general blame on her noble niece as a person given up to a zeal that wanted government she threw out hints injurious to the sincerity of the three brothers as well as to that of the father and mother with regard to me all which i discountenanced  i have hardly ever conversed with a woman so artful as lady sforza i wonder not that she had the address to fire the count of belvedere with impatience and to set him on seeking to provoke me to an act of rashness which after what had happened between me and the young count altieri some years ago at verona might have been fatal to one if not to both and by that means rid italy if not the world of me and at the same time revenged herself on the count for rejecting her daughter who as i have told you before has a passion for him in a manner that she called too contemptuous to be passed over  she told me that she doubted not now that i had been circumvented by what even she an italian called italian finesse but her niece would be prevailed upon to marry the count and bid me mind her words ah my poor laurana added she  but i will renounce her if she can be so mean as to retain love for a man who despises her  a convent she said after such a malady as clementina had been afflicted with would be the fittest place for her she ascribed to hers and lauranas treatment of her with great vehemence on my disallowing her assertion the foundation of her cure she wished that were clementina to marry it might have been me preferably to any other man since the love she bore me was most likely to complete her recovery which was not to be expected were she to marry a man to whom she was indifferent  but added she they must take their own way  lady laurana was on a visit at the borromean palace her mother sent for her unknown to me i could very well have excused the compliment i was civil however i could be no more than civil and after a stay of two hours pursued my route  nothing remarkable happened in my journey i wrote to jeronymo and his beloved sister from lions  at the post house there i found a servant of lady olivia with a letter he was ordered to overtake and give it into my own hands were he to travel with it to paris or even to england lady olivia will be obeyed the man missed me by my going to visit lady sforza at milan i enclosed the letter as also a copy of mine to which it is an answer when you read them you will be of opinion that they ought not to pass your own hands perhaps you will choose to read them in this place  letter xli sir charles grandison to lady olivia bologna saturday aug    0 now at last is the day approaching that the writer of this will be allowed to consider himself wholly as an englishman he is preparing to take perhaps an everlasting leave of italy but could he do this and not first bid adieu to two ladies at florence whose welfare will be ever dear to him  lady olivia and mrs beaumont it must be to both by letter  i told you madam when i last attended you that possibly i should never see you more if i told you so in anger pardon me now in a farewell letter i would not upbraid you i will be all in fault if you please i never incurred the displeasure of olivia but i was more concerned for her than for what i suffered from it and yet her displeasure was not a matter of indifference to me  i wish not madam for my own happiness with more sincerity than i do for yours would to heaven it were in my power to promote it i will flatter myself that my true regard for your honor daughter as you are of a house next to princely and of fortune more than princely will give me an influence which will awaken you to your glory allow madam the friendly the brotherly expostulation  let me think let me speak of olivia in absence as a fond brother would of a sister most dear to him i will so speak so think of you madam when far distant from you when i remember my italian friends it will always be with tender blessings and the most affectionate gratitude allow me olivia to number you with the dearest of those friends your honor your welfare present and future is and ever will be the object of my vows  god and nature have done their parts by you let not your own be wanting to what purpose live we if not to grow wiser and to subdue our passions dear lady illustrious woman how often have you been subdued by the violence of yours and to what submissions has your generous repentance subjected you even to your inferiors let me not be thought a boaster  but i will presume to say that i am the rather entitled to advise as i have made it my endeavor and i bless god have not been always unsuccessful to curb my passions they are naturally violent what do i owe to the advice of an excellent man whom i early set up as my monitor let me in this letter be yours  your situation in life your high birth your illustrious line of ancestors are so many calls upon you in whom the riches and the consequence of so many noble progenitors center to act worthy of their names of their dignities of your own and of the dignity of your sex the world looks up to you your education too so greatly beyond that of most italian ladies with the expectation of an example  yet have not evil reports already gone out upon your last excursion the world will not see with our eyes nor judge as we would have it and as we sometimes know it ought to judge my visit to italy when you were absent from it and in england was of service to your fame the malignant world at present holds itself suspended in its censures and expects from your suture conduct either a confutation or a confirmation of them it is therefore still in your power rejoice madam that it is for ever to establish or for ever to depreciate your character in the judgment both of friends and enemies  how often have i seen passion and evenrage deform features that are really lovely shall it be said that your great fortune your abundance has been a snare to you that you would have been a happier nay a better woman had not god so bountifully blessed you  can your uatural generosity of temper allow you to bear such an imputation as that the want of power only can keep you within the limits pardon olivia the lover of your fame which the gentleness of your sex which true honor prescribe  you are a young lady three fourths of your natural life heaven permitting are yet to come you have noble qualities shining accomplishments you will probably in a very few years perhaps in a few months be able to establish yourself with the world so far only as you have gone the inconsideration of youth will be allowed an excuse for your conduct blessed with means as you are you still have it in your power let me repeat to be an honor to your sex to your country to your splendid house and to the age to which you are given  the monitor i mentioned you know him by person by manners from my earlier youth born as he knew me to be the heir of a considerable fortune suggested to me an address to heaven which my heart has had no repugnance to make a daily one that the almighty will in mercy withold from me wealth and affluence and make my proud heart a dependant one even for my daily bread were riches to be a snare to me and if i found not my inclinations to do good as occasions offered enlarge with my power  o that you olivia were poor and low if the being so and nothing else would make you know yourself and act accordingly  and that it were given to me by acts of fraternal love to restore you as you could bear it to an independence large as your own wishes  wha an uncontrollable man would lady olivia have made had she been a man with but the same passions that now diminish the grand  soul and so large a power to gratify them  what a sovereign  look into the characters of absolute princes and see whose of all those who have sullied royalty by the violence of their wills you would have wished to copy or to have been compared with  how has the unhappy olivia though but a subject dared  how often has that tender bosom whose glory it would have been to melt at anothers woe and to rejoice in acts of kindness and benevolence to her fellow creatures been armed by herself not the mistress but the slave of her passions not with defensive but offensive steel alluding to the poniard she wore in her bosom  hitherto providence has averted any remediless mischief but providence will not be tempted  believe me still believe me madam i mean not to upbraid you my dear olivia i will call you how often has my heart bled for you how paternally though but of years to be your brother have i lamented for you in secret i will own to you that but for the withholding prudence and withholding honor that i owned to both our characters because of a situation which would not allow me to express my tenderness for you i had folded you in your contrite moments to my bosom and on my knees besought you to act up to your own knowledge and to render yourself worthy of your illustrious ancestry and what but your glory could have been what but that is now my motive  with what joy do i reflect that i took not god be praised for his restraining goodness advantage of the favor i stood in with a most lovely and princelyspirited woman an advantage that would have given me cause to charge myself with baseness to her in the hour wherein i should have wanted most consolation with what apprehension dreading for myself because of the great the sometimes almost irresistible temptation have i looked upon myself to be shall i say the sole guardian of olivias honor more than once most generous and confiding of women have i from your unmerited favor for me besought you to spare me my pride and as often to permit me to spare you yours  not the odious vice generally known by that name the fault of fallen angels but that which may be called a prop a support to an imperfect goodness which properly directed may in time grow into virtue  that friendly pride let me add which has ever warmed my heart with wishes for your temporal and eternal welfare  i call upon you once more my friend how unreproachingly may we call each other by that sacred name the friend of your fame the friend of your soul calls upon you once more to rejoice with him that you have it still in your power to tread the path of honor again i glory and let us both that we have nothing to reproach each other with i leave italy a country that ever will have a title to my grateful regard without one selfupbraiding sigh though not without many sighs i own it to olivia justice requires it justice to a lady olivia loves not but who deserves not only hers but the love of every woman for she is an ornament to her sex and to human nature yet be it known to olivia that i am a sufferer by that very magnanimity for which i revere her  a rejected man  will olivia rejoice that i am  she will what inequalities are there in the greatest minds but subdue them in yours for your own sake not for mine subdue them the conquest will be more glorious to you than the acquisition of an empire could be  let me conclude with an humble but earnest wish that you will cultivate as once you promised me the friendship of one of the best of women mrs beaumont disposed as she your neighbor is to cultivate yours i shall then hear often from you by the pen of that excellent woman your compliance with this humble advice will give me madam for your own sake and for the pleasure i know mrs beaumont will have in it the greatest joy that is possible for you to give to a heart that overflows with sincere wishes for your happiness a heart that will rejoice in every opportunity that shall be granted to promote it for i am and ever will be  the friend of your fame of your true glory and your devoted servant grandison  letter xlii lady olivia to sir charles grandison translated by dr bartlett florence aug    sept   i am to take it kindly that you have thought fit to write to the unhappy olivia before you leave italy i could not have expected even this poor savor after the parting it was your pleasure to call everlasting cruel man  can i still call you so  i did before i had this letter and was determind that you should have reason to repent your cruelty but this letter has almost reconciled me to you so far reconciled me however as to oblige me to lay aside the intended vengeance that was rolling toward you from slighted love you have awakened me to my glory by your dispassionate your tender reasonings your letter for i have erased one officious passage in it is in my bosom all day it is on my pillow at night the last thing and the first thing do i read it the contents make my rest balmy my uprising serene but it was not till i had read it the seventh time and after i had erased that obnoxious passage that it began to have that happy effect upon me i was above advice for the first day i could not relish your reasonings resolutions of vengeance had possessed me wholly what a charm could there be in a letter that should make a flighted woman lay aside her meditated vengeance a woman too that had fallen beneath herself in the object of that despised love  allow me grandison to say so in the account of wordly reckoning it was so and when i thought i hated you it was so in my own account yet could you have returned my love i would have gloried in my choice and attributed to envy all the insolent censures of maligners  but even at the seventh perusal when my indignation began to give way would it have given way had you not in the same letter hinted that the proud bologna had given up all thoghts of a husband in the man to whom my heart had been so long attached  allow me to call her by the name of her city i love not her nor her family i hate them by their own proud names it is an hereditary hatred augmented by rivalry a rivalry that had like to have been a successful one and is she not proud who whatever be her motive can refuse the man who has rejected a nobler woman yet i think i ought to forgive her for has she not avenged me if you are grieved that she has refused you i am rejoiced be the pangs she has so often given me if possible forgotten  what a miserable wretch however from my own reflections did this intelligence make me intelligence that i received before your letter blessed m hands let me so express myself the contents i hope will be the means of blessings by purifying my heart  and why a miserable wretch  o this man of sentiments the most delicate of life and manners the most unblameable yet of air and behavior so truly gallant had it not been for thy forwardness olivia had it not been for proposals shame to thyself shame to thy sex too plainly intimated to him proposals that owed their existence to inconsiderate love a love mingled i will now confess with passions of the darkest hue  envy malice  and those aggravated by despair  would on this disappointment from the bologna have offered his hand to the florentine  but now do i own that it cannot that it ought not to be for what olivia is there in the glitter of thy fortune thy greatest dependence to attract a man whom worldly grandeur cannot influence who has a fortune of his own so ample that hundreds are the better for it  a man whose economy is regulated by prudence who cannot be in such difficulties as would give some little merit to the person who was so happy as to extricate him from them  a man in short who takes pleasure in conferring obligations yet never lays himself under the necessity of receiving returns prince of a man what prince king emperor is so truly great as this man and is he not likewise surrounded by his nobles  what a number of people of high interior worth make up the circle of his acquaintance  and is there not cannot there yet be hope the proud bologna now as she is out of the question  the florentine wants not pride but betrayed by the violence of her temper she has not had the caution to confine herself within the bounds of female shall i say hypocrisy what she could not hide from herself she revailed to the man she loved but never however was there any other man whom she loved upon whom but one man the haughty object of her passion did she ever condescend to look down who but he was ever encouraged to look up to her  and did not his gentle his humane his unreproaching heart seem to pity rather than despise her till she was too far engaged at the time that she first cast her eyes upon him his fortune was not high his father a man of expense was living and likely to live his sisters whom he loved as himself were hopeless of obtaining from their father fortunes equal to their rank and education olivia knew all this from unerring intelligence his friends his bartlett his beauchamp and others were not in circumstances that set them above owing obligations to him slender as were his own appointments  then it was that thou olivia valuedst thyself for being blessed with means to make the power of the man thou lovedst as large as his heart thou would have vested it all in him thou would have conditioned with him that this he should do for one sister this for the other this for one friend this for another and still another to the extent of his wishes and with him and the remainder thou would have been happy  surely there was some merit in olivias love  but alas she was not prudent her temper supposed to be naturally haughty and violent hurried her into measures too impetuous the soul of the man she loved too great to be attracted by riches by worldly glory and capable of being happy in a mere competence was how can i say it i blush while i write it disgusted by a violence that had not been used to be restrained by the accustomed reserve it was all open day no dark machinating night in the heart of the undissembling olivia she persecuted the object of her passion with her love because she thought she could lay him under obligation to it by hoping to prove herself more she made herself appear less than woman she despised that affectation that hypocrify in her sex which unpenetrating eyes attribute to modesty and shame  shame of what of a natural passion  but you grandison were too delicate to be taken with her sincerity if you had penetration to distinguish between reserve and openness of heart you had not greatness of mind enough to break through the low restraints of custom and to reward the latter in preference to the former yet who better than you knows that women in love are actuated by one view and differ only in outward appearance will bars bolts walls rivers seas any more withold the supercilious than the less reserved that passion which made the florentine compass earth and seas in hopes of obtaining its end made perhaps the prouder bologna and from pride a more pitiable object  yet who ever imputed immodesty to olivia who ever dared to harbor a thought injurious to her virtue you only custom her judge have the power but not i hope the will to upbraid her you can the creature who conscious of having alarmed you by the violence of her temper would have lived with you on terms of probation and left it to your honor on full consideration and experience of that temper to reward her with the celebration or punish her with rejection her whole fortune devoted to you had subjected herself to your challenges but nobody else could harbor a thought inglorious to her  and must she yield to the consciousness of her own unworthiness from a proposal made by herself which tyrant custom only can condemn  o yes she must there is among your countrywomen one who seems born for you and you for her if she can abate of a digni y that a first and only love alone can gratify and accept of a secondplaced love a widowerbatchelor as i may call you she i know must will be the happywoman to her the slighted florentine can resign which with patience she never could to the proud bologna and the sooner because of the immortal hatred she bears to that woman of bologna you grandison have been accustomed to be distinguished by women who in degree and fortune might claim rank with princesses degree and fortune captivate you not  this humbler fairone is more suitable to your own degree and in the beauties of person and mind at least in those beauties of the latter which you most admire she is superior either to your bolognese or florentine let my pen praise her though malice to clementina and despair of obtaining my own wishes mingle with my ink  she is mild though sparkling she is humble yet has dignity she is reserved yet is frank and openhearted nobody can impute to her either dissimulation or license of behavour we read her heart in her countenance and have no thought of looking further for it wisdom has its seat on her lips modesty on her brow her eves avows the secrets of her soul and demonstrate that she has no one that she need to be ashamed of she can blush for others for the unhappy olivia she did more than once but for herself she need not blush i loved yet feared her the moment i saw her i dared not to try myself by her judgment it was easy for me to see that she loved you yet such were your engagements your supposed engagements that i pitied her and can we be alarmed by or angry at her whom we pity  unworthy grandison unworthy i will call you because you cannot merit the love of such a spotless heart you who could leave her and under color of honor when there was no preengagement and when the proud family had rejected you prefer to such a fine young creature a romantic enthusiast  o may the sweet maiden who wants not due consciousness of interior worth assert herself and by refusing your secondplaed addresses vindicate the dignity of beauty and innocence unequalled  if you grandison cannot forgive olivia for loving you too well for rendering herself too cheap to you if you cannot repair in her own eyes the honor of one who in that cae must be sunk in yours beyond the power of restoration if you cannot forgive attempts of the hand in which the heart had no share but resisted in a word if you cannot forgive the fervor of a love that at times combating my pride had nearly overturned my reason also  then let this virgin goodness be yours and olivia will endeavor to forgive you  yet  o that yet  ah grandison  but how can a woman bear that refusal which however superior she may be in rank in fortune gives her an inferiority to the man of her wishes in the very article in which it should be a womans glory to retain dignity even were the man superior to her in birth and in all other outward advantages i disdain thee grandison in this light i will tear thy proud image from my heart or die  one request only let me make and permit your pride to comply with it return not to me but accept accept as a token of love the cabinets which perhaps will be in england before you they will be thought by you of too great value but they are not too great for the grandeur of my fortune and the magnificence of my spirit the medals alone make a collection that would do credit to the cabinet of a sovereign prince these are in your taste they are nothing to olivia but for your sake accept of these cabinets as some atonement for the trouble i have given you for the attempts i have made upon your liberty and more than once but oh with how feeble a hand upon your life how easy had it been to take the latter your soul so fearless braving menace and danger had i been resoved to take it how many ministers of vengeance in my country had i been determined to execute it would my fortune have procured me how easy would it have been for me to conceal my guilt from all but myself had the slowworking bowl or even the sharppointed poniard given thee up to my great revenge  it is happy for us both however that the proud bigot rejected you your death and my distraction had probably been the consequence of her acceptance of you  yet how i rave  the moment i had seen you my vengeance would have been arrested as more than once it was o grandison how dear are you  were you now i will endeavor to say to the soul of olivia dearer than same than glory and whatever the world deems valuable  all that i ask of you now that the bologna in disappointing you has disappointed herself great revenge is within your own power to grant without detriment to yourself and i hope without regret it consists of two or three articles the first is to resolve within yourself that you will not now should that heat of the zealots imagination which has seemed to carry her above herself subside as i have no doubt but it will and should she even follow you to your native place as a still nobler woman ignobly did that you will not now receive her offered hand  o grandison if you do   next that you will thus fairly though foolishly dismissed and the whole family rejoicing in your dismission well as they pretend to love you put it out of your own power since the florentine can have no hope to give the bolognese any my soul thirsts to see her in a nunnery i could myself assume the veil in the same convent i think i could for the pleasure of exulting over her for the pangs she has occasioned me but for her olivia would have been mistress of her own wishes  preach not to me grandison against that spirit of revenge which ever did and ever must actuate my heart slighted love will warrant it or nothing can have i not lost the man i loved by it can i regain him if i conquer that not ignoble vehemence of a great mind  no  forbear then the unavailing precept i am not of bologna i am no zealot while the warm blood flows in my veins i pretend not to be above human nature when i can divest myself of that then perhaps i may follow your advice i may seek to cultivate the friendship of mrs beaumont but till then she would not accept of mine  o grandison born to distinction princely in your munificence amiable in your person great in your mind in your sentiments you have conquered your ambition  you may therefore unite yourself to the politest country maid and the loveliest that ever adorned your various climate yet o that in the same hour the bolognese might assume the veil and the lovely english maid refuse your offered hand  my third request is as before requested that you will not refuse the cabinets which will be soon embarked for you be not afraid of me grandison i form no pretensions upon you from this present valuable as you perhaps may think it your simple acceptance is all the return i hope for write only these words with your own hand  olivia i accept your present and thank you for it receive it only as a token of my past love for a man whose virtues i admire and by degrees shall hope to imitate that sir when a certain event was most my wish was not the least motive for that wish but now what will be the destiny of the bewildered creature who is left at large to her own will who can tell a will that only one man in the world could have subjugated his control would have been freedom  i would not have you imagine that a correspondence by letter is hoped for as a return for the present of which i entreat your acceptance but when i can assure you that your advice will probably be of great service to me in the conduct of my future life as i have no doubt it will from the calm effects that the letter which has now a place in my bosom has already produced there i am ready to flatter myself that a wish so ardent and so justifiable will be granted to the repeated request of  olivia   continuation of sir charles grandisons letter no xl begun p     olivia you see my dear dr bartlett concludes her letter with a desire of corresponding with me as she has put it i cannot refuse her request how happy should i think myself if i could be a means effectually to serve her in the conduct of her future life  i have written to her that i shall think an intercourse by letters an honor done me if she will allow me to treat her with the freedom and the singleness of heart of an affectionate brother  as to her particular recommendation of a third person i tell her that must be the subject of the future correspondence to which she is pleased to invite me  olivia may be in earnest in her warm commendations of a lady of whose excellencies nobody can write or speak with indifference but i have no doubt that she is very earnest to know my sentiments on the subject but what must be the mind of the bachelorwidower as she calls me if already i can enter into the subject with anybody with lady olivia especially the most sensible i will not say subtle creature on earth is certainly a woman in love what can escape her penetration what can bound her curiosity  i tell her that i can neither decline nor accept of her present till i see the contents of the cabinets she is pleased to mention it will give me pain i say to refuse any favor from lady olivia by which she intends to show her esteem of me but favors of so high a price will and ought to give scruples to one who would not be thought ungenerous  i had always admired i tell her her collection of medals but they are a family collection of two or three generations and i should not allow myself to accept of such a treasure unless i could have an opportunity given me to show if not my merit my gratitude and that i saw no possibility of being blessed with in any manner that could make the acceptance tolerably easy to myself i cannot my dear dr bartlett receive from this munificent lady a present that is of such high intrinsic worth had she offered me anything that would have had its value from the giver or to the receiver for its own sake and not equally to anybody else for instance had she desired me to accept of her picture since the original could not me mine i would not have refused it though it had been incircled with jewels of price but circumstanced as this unhappy lady and i are could i have asked her for a favor of that nature  i think i have broken through one delicacy in consenting to correspond with this lady she should not have asked it i never knew a pain of so particular a nature as this lady a not ungenerous though a rash one has given me my very heart recoils dr bartlett at the thought of a denial of marriage to a woman expecting the offer whom delicacy has not quite forsaken  but a word or two more on this subject of presents when the whole family at bologna were so earnestly solicitous to show their gratitude to me by some permanent token i had once the thought of asking for their clementinas picture in miniature but as i was never to think of her as mine and as probably my picture if but for politeness sake would have been asked for in exchange i was afraid of cherishing by that means in her mind the tender ideas of our past friendship and thereby of making the work of her parents difficult and do they not the more excusably hope to succeed in their views as they think their success will be a means to secure health of mind to their child but if they visit me in england i will then request the pictures of the whole family in one large piece for the principal ornament of grandisonhall  by what olivia says of designs on my liberty i believe she means to include the attempt made upon me at florence which i hinted at in my last and supposed to come from that quarter what she would have done with me had the attempt succeeded i cannot imagine i should not have wished to have been the subject of so romantic an adventure  a prisoner to a lady in her castle  she is certainly one of the most enterprising women in italy and her temper is too well seconded by her power she would not however in that case have had recourse to fatal acts of violence once you know she had thoughts of exciting against me the holy tribunal but i was upon such a foot as a traveller and as an english protestant though avowed not behaving indiscreetly that i had friends enough even in the sacred college to have rendered ineffectual any steps of that sort and after all her machinations were but transitory ones and the moment she saw me given over  my first enquiry after my arrival here was after my poor cousin grandison my poor cousin indeed what a spiritless figure does he make i remember you once said that it was more difficult for a man to behave well in prosperity than in adversity but the man who will prove the observation to be true must not be one who by his own extravagance and vice has reduced himself from an affluence to which he was born to penury at least to a state of obligation and dependence good god that a man should be so infatuated as to put on the cast of a dye the estate of which he is in unquestioned possession from his ancestors yet who will say that he who hopes to win what belongs to another does not deserve to lose his own  i soothed my cousin in the best manner i could consistently with justice yet i told him that his repentance must arise from his judgment as well as from his sufferings and that he would have less reason for regretting the unhappy situation to which he had reduced himself if the latter brought him to a right sense of his errors i was solicitous dr bartlett for the sake of his own peace of mind that he should fall into a proper train of thinking but i told him that preachment was no more my intention than recrimination  i have two hands to one tongue my cousin said i and the latter i use not but to tell you that both the former are cordially at your service you have considered this matter well no doubt added i can you propose to me any means of retrieving your affairs  there is said he one way it would do everything for me but i am afraid of mentioning it to you  if it be a just way fear not if it be anything i can do for you out of my own single purse without asking any second or third person to contribute to it command me  he hesitated  if it be anything my cousin said i that you think i ought not in justice in honor to comply with do not for your own sake mention it let me see that your calamity has had a proper effect upon you let not the just man be sunk in the man in adversity and then open your mind freely to me  he could not he said trust the mention of the expedient to me till he had given it a further consideration  well sir be pleased to remember that i will never ask you to mention it because i cannot doubt but you will if on consideration you think it a proper expedient  when some friends who came to visit me on my arrival were gone my cousin resumed the former subject but he offered not to mention his expedient i hope it was not that he had a view to my emily i am very jealous for my emily if i thought poor everard had but an imagination of retrieving his affairs by her fortune nothing but his present calamity should hinder me from reneuncing for ever my cousin  i enquired particularly into the situation he was in and if there were a likelihood of doing anything with the gamesters but he could not give me room for such an expectation i find he has lost all his estate to them duntonfarm excepted which having been much out of repair is now fitting up for a new tenant and will not for three or four years to come bring him in a clear fifty pounds a year  i have known more men than one who could not live upon fifteen hundred a year bring themselves to be contented with fifty but mr grandison is so fallen in spirit that he never will be able to survive such a change of fortune if i do not befriend him poor man he is but the shadow of what he was the first formerly in the fashion in body and face so erect his steps so firm gait so assured air so genteel eye so lively  but now in so few months gaunt sides his halfworn tarnishdlaced coat big enough to lap over him hollow cheeks puling voice sighing heart creeping feet  o my dr bartlett how much does it behove men so little able to bear distress to avoid falling into it by their own extravagance but for a man to fall into indigence through avarice for what is a spirit of gaming but a spirit of avarice and that of the worst sort how can such a one support his own reflections  i had supposed that he had no reason in this shattered state of his affairs to apprehend anything from the prosecution set on foot by the woman who claimed him on promise of marriage but i was mistaken she has or pretends to have he told me witnesses of the promise poor shameful man what witnesses needed she if he knows he made it and received the prostigate consideration  i am not happy my dear friend in my mind i hope to be tolerably so if my next letters from bologna are favorable as to the state of health of the beloved brother and sister there  it would have been no disagreeable amusement to me at this time to have proceeded directly to ireland the rather as i hope a visit to my estate there is become almost necessary by the forwardness the works are in which i set on foot when i was on that more than agreeable spot but the unhappy situation of mr grandisons affairs and my hopes of bringing those of lady mansfield to an issue together with the impatience i have to see my english friends determine me to the contrary tomorrow will be the last day of my stay in this city and the day after my cousin and i shall set out for calais  very quickly therefore after the receipt of this letter which shuts up the account of my foreign excursions will you by your paternal goodness if in london help to calm the disturbed heart of  your charles grandison   letter xliii lady g to miss byron london tuesday sept   congratulate us my dearest miss byron on the arrival of my brother he came last night it was late and he sent to us this morning and to others of his friends my lord and i hurried away to breakfast with him ah my dear we see too plainly that he has been very much disturbed in mind he looks more wan and is thinner than he was but he is the same kind brother friend and good man  i expected a little hint or two from him on my past vivacities but not a word of that nature he felicitated my good man and me and when he spoke of lord and lady l and his joy in their happiness he put two sisters and their good men together as two of the happiest pairs in england politic enough for as we sat at breakfast two or three toysome things were said by my lord no ape was ever so fond and i could hardly forbear him but the reputation my brother gave me was a restraint upon me i see one may be flattered by underserved compliments into good behavior when we have a regard to the complimenter  aunt nell was all joy and gladness she was in raptures last night it seems at her nephews first arrival he rejoiced to see her and was so thankful to her for letting him find her in town and at his house that she resolves she will not leave him till he is married the good old soul imagines she is of importance to him in the direction of the family matters now i have left him  i harriet there is selfimportance  but good creatures these old virgins they do so love to be thought useful  well and is not that a good sign on aunt nells part does it not look as if she would have been an useful creature in the days of nightrail and notableness had she been a wife in good time i always think when i see those badgerly virgins fond of a parrot a squirrel a monkey or a lapdog that their imagination makes our husband and children in the animals  poor things  but as to her care i dare say that will only serve to make bustle and confusion where else would be order and regularity for my brother has the best of servants  i wished her in in berkshire fifty times as we sat at breakfast for when i wanted to ask my brother twenty thousand questions and to set him on talking we were entertained with her dreams of the night before his arrival and last night  seas crossed rivers forded  dangers escaped by the help of angels and saints for the resveries of the former night and for the last the music of the spheres heaven and joy and festivity  the plump creature loves good cheer harriet  in short hardly a word could we say but what put her upon recollecting a part of one of her dreams yet some excuse lies good for an old soul whose whole life has been but one dream a little fallalishly varied  and would you think it yes i believe you would my odd creature was once or twice put upon endeavoring to recollect two or three dreams of his own of the week past and would have gone on if i had not silenced him by a frown as he looked upon me for his cue as a tender husband ought  beauchamp came in and i thought would have relieved us but he put my aunt in mind of an almostforgotten part of her dream for just such a joyful meeting just such expressions of gladness did she dream of as she now beheld and heard between my brother and him felicitating each other duce take these dreaming souls to remember their resveries when realities infinitely more affecting are before them but reflection and prognostic are ever inspiriting parts of the pretension of people who have lived long dead to the present the past and the future filling their minds and why should not they be indulged in the thought that they know something more than those who are less abstracted and who are contented with looking no further than the present  sir charles enquired after sir harrys health mr beauchamp with a concern that did him credit lamented his declining way and he spoke so respectfully of lady beauchamp and of her tenderness to his father as made my brothers eyes glisten with pleasure  lord and lady l dr bartlett and emily were at colnebrook but as they had left orders to be sent for the moment my brother arrived for you need not doubt but his last letter prepared us to expect him soon they came time enough to dine with us there was a renewal of joy among us  emily the dear emily fainted away embracing the knees of her guardian as she unawares to him threw herself at his feet with joy that labored for expression but could not obtain it he was affected so was beauchamp so were we all she was carried out just as she was recovering to a shame and confusion of face for which only her own modesty could reproach her  there are susceptibilities which will show themselves in outward acts and there are others which cannot burst out into speech lady ls joy was of the former mine of the latter sort but she is used to tenderness of heart mine are ready to burst my heart but never hardly can rise to my lips  my eyes however are great talkers  the pleasure that sir charles lord l and dr bartlett mutually expressed to see each other was great tender and manly my bustling nimble lord enjoyed over again his joy at that of every other person and he was ready goodnaturedly to sing and dance  that is his way poor man to show his joy but he is honest for all that dont despise him harriet he was brought up as an only son and to know that he was a lord or else he would have made a better figure in your eyes the man wants not sense i assure you you may think me partial but i believe the most foolish thing he ever did in his life was at church and that at st georges hanoversquare poor soul he might have had a wife better suited to his taste and then his very foibles would have made him shine but harriet it is not always given to us to know what is best for ourselves black women i have heard remarked like fair men fair men black women and tempers suit best with contraries were we all to like the same person or thing equally we should be forever engaged in bro as it is human nature  vile rogue as i have heard it called is quarrelsome enough so my lord being a lost man fell in love if it please you with a saucy woman he ought to be meek and humble you know he would not let me be quiet till i was his we are often to be punished by our own choice but i am very good to him now i dont know harriet whether it is best for me to break him of his trifling or not unless one were sure that he could creditably support the alteration now can i laugh at him and if the baby is froppish can coax him into good humor a sugarplumb and a courtesy will do at any time and by setting him into a broad grin i can laugh away his anger but should i endeavor to make him wise as the man has not been used to it and as his education has not given him a turn to significance dont you think he would he would be awkward and what is worse assuming well i will consider of this before i attempt to newcast him mean time i repeat  dont you my dear for my sake think meanly of lord g  ha ha ha hah  what do i laugh at do you ask me harriet  something so highly ridiculous  i have  i have  sent him away from me so much ashamed of himself  he bears anything from me now that he knows i am only in play with him and have so very right a heart  i must lay down my pen  poor soul hah hah hah hah  i do love him for his simplicity  well i will not tell you what i laughed at just now for fear you should laugh at us both my brothers arrival has tuned every string of my heart to joy the holding up of a straw will throw me into titteration  i can hardly forbear laughing again to think of the shame the poor soul showed when he slunk away from me after all he ill brooks to be laughed at does not that look as if he were conscious  but what harriet will you ask mean i by thus trifling with you and at this time particularly  why i would be glad to make you smile either with me or at me i am indifferent which so that you do but smile  you do  i protest you do  well now that i have obtained my wishes i will be serious  we congratulated my brother on the happy turn in the healths of his italian friends without naming names or saying a word of the sister we had like to have had he looked earnestly at each of us bowed to our congratulations but was silent dr bartlett had told us that he never in his letters to my brother mentioned your being not well because he knew it would disturb him he had many things to order and do so that except at breakfast when aunt nell invaded us with her dreams and at dinner when the servants attendance made our discourse general we had hardly any opportunity of talking to him but in the space between teatime and supper he came and told us that he was devoted to us for the remainder of the day persons present were lord and lady l myself and my good man dr bartlett mr beauchamp and emily good girl quite recovered and blyth as a bird attentive to every word that passed the lips of her guardian  o but aunt nell was also present  poor soul i had like to have forgot her  in the first place you must take it for granted that we all owned we had seen most of what he had written to dr bartlett  what troubles what anguish of mind what a strange variety of conflicts has your heart had to contend with my dear sir charles began mr beauchamp and at last what a strange disappointment from one of the noblest of women  very true my beauchamp he then said great and glorious things of lady clementina we all joined in admiring her he seemed to have great pleasure in hearing us praise her  very true harriet  but you have generosity enough to be pleased with him for that  aunt eleanor i will not call her aunt nell any more if i can help it asked him if he thought it were possible for the lady to hold her resolution now you have actually left italy nephew and are at such a distance dont you think her love will return  good soul she has substantial notions still left i find of ideal love those notions i fansy last a long time with those who have not had the opportunity of gratifying the silly passion  be angry if you will harriet i dont care  well but thus gravely as became the question answered my brother  the favor which this incomparable lady honored me with was never disowned on the contrary it was always avowed and to the very last she had therefore no uncertainty to contend with she had no balancings in her mind her contention as she supposed was altogether in favor of her duty to heaven she is exemplarily pious while she remains a zealous roman catholic she must persevere and i dare say she will  i dont know what to make of these papists said our old protestant aunt nell  aunt nell did i say cry mercy  thank god you are come home safe and sound and without a papistical wife  it is very hard if england cannot find a wife for you nephew  we all smiled at aunt nell  the duce is in me i believe  aunt nell again  but let it go  when lady g asked lady l saw you or heard you from the dowager countess of d  is there any other countess of d lady l said sir charles a fine glow taking possession of his cheeks  your servant brother thought i i am not sorry for your charming apprehensiveness  no sir replied lady l  would you brother said boldface you know who that is harriet that there should be another countess of d  i wish my lord d happy charlotte i hear him as well spoken of as any of our young nobility  you dont know what i mean i warrant sir charles resumed with an intentional archness your saucy friend  i believe i do lady g i wish miss byron to be one of the happiest women in the world because she is one of the best  my dear to emily i hope you have had nothing to disturb or vex you from your mothers husband   nor from my mother sir  all is good and as it should be you have overcome   that is well my dear  would not the bathwaters be good for sir harry my dear beauchamp  a second remove thought i but i will catch you brother i will warrant as rustics sometimes in their play do a ball on the rebound  now you will be piqued i warrant harriet your delicacy will be offended because i urged the question i see a blush of disdain arising in your lovely cheek and conscious eye restoring the roses to the one and its natural brilliancy to the other indeed we all began to be afraid of a little affectation in my brother but we needed not he would not suffer us to put him upon the subject again after a few other general questions and answers of who and who and how and how and what and when andsoforth he turned to dr bartlett  my dear friend said he you gave me pain a little while ago when i asked you after the health of miss byron and her friends you evaded my question i thought and your looks alarmed me i am afraid poor mrs shirley  miss byron spoke of her always as in an infirm state how charlotte would our dear miss byron grieve were she to lose so good a relation  i intended not answered the doctor that you should see i was concerned but i think it impossible ble that a father can love a daughter better than i love miss byron  you would alarm me indeed my dear friend if lady g had not by her usual liveliness just now put me out of all apprehensions for the health of miss byron i hope miss byron is well  indeed she is not said i with a gravity becoming the occasion  god forbid said he with an emotion that pleased everybody  not for your sake harriet  be not affectedly nice now but for our own   his face was in a glow  what lady l what charlotte said he ails miss byron  she is not well brother replied i but the most charming sick woman that ever lived she is cheerful that she may give no uneasiness to her friends she joins in all their conversations diversions amusements she would fain be well and likes not to be thought ill were it not for her faded cheeks her pale lips and her changed complexion we should not know from herself that she ailed anything some people reach perfection sooner than others and are as swift in their decay  poor miss byron seems not to be built for duration  but should i write these things to you my dear yet i know that lady clementina and you are sisters in magnanimity  my brother was quite angry with me  dear dr bartlett said he explain this speech of charlotte she loves to amuse  miss byron is blessed with a good constitution she is hardly yet in the perfection of her bloom set my heart at rest i love not either of my sisters more than i do miss byron dear charlotte i am really angry with you  my goodnatured lord reddened up to his naked ears at hearing my brother say he was angry with me sir charles said he i am sorry you are so soon angry with your sister it is too true miss byron is ill she is i fear in a declining way   pardon me my dear lord g  yet i am ready to be angry with anybody that shall tell me miss byron is in a declining way  dr bartlett  pray   indeed sir miss byron is not well  lady g has mingled her fears with her love in the description miss byron cannot but be lovely her complexion is still fine she is cheerful serene resigned   resigned dr bartlett  miss byron is a saint she cannot but be resigned in the solemn sense of the word  resignation implies hopelessness if she is so ill would not you my dear dr bartlett have informed me of it  or was it from tenderness  you must be kind in all you do  i did not apprehend said lady l that miss byron was so very much indisposed did you my lord to lord l upon my word doctor sister it was unkind if so that you made me not acquainted   and then her goodnatured eye dropped a tear of love for her harriet  i was sorry this went so far my brother was very uneasy so was mr beauchamp for him and for you my dear  that she is and endeavors to be so cheerful said beauchamp shows that nothing lies upon her mind  my fathers illness only can more affect me than miss byrons  emily wept for her miss byron she has always been afraid that her illness would be attended with ill consequences  my dear love my harriet you must be well see how everybody loves you i told my brother that i expected a letter from northamptonshire by the next post and i would inform him truly of the state of your health from the contents of it  i would not for the world have you think my harriet that i meant to excite my brothers attention to you by what i said your honor is the honor of the sex for are you not one of the most delicateminded as well as frankest of it it is no news to say that my brother dearly loves you i did not want to know his solicitude for your health where he once loves he always loves did you not observe that i supposed it a natural decline god grant that it may not be so and thus am i imprudently discouraging you in mentioning my apprehensions of your all health in order to show my regard for your punctilio but you shall you will be well and the wife of  the best of men  god grant it may be so  but however that is to be we have all laid our heads together and are determined for your delicacysake to let this matter take its course since after an opening so undesignedly warm you might otherwise imagine our solicitude in the affair capable of being thought too urgent i tell you my dear that worthy as sir charles grandison is of a princess he shall not call you by his name but with all his soul  as my brother laid it out to us this evening i find we shall lose him for some days the gamesters whom mr grandison permitted to ruin him are at winchester dividing i suppose and rejoicing over their spoils of the last season whether my brother intends to see them or not i cannot tell he expects not to do anything with them they no doubt will show the foolish fellow that they can keep what he could not and sir charles aims only at practicable and legal not at romantic redresses  sir charles intends to pay his respects to lord and lady w at windsor and to the earl of g and lady gertrude who are at their berkshire seat my honest lord has obtained my leave at the first asking to attend him thither  my brother will wait on sir harry and lady beauchamp in his way to lady mansfields  beauchamp will accompany him thither poor grandison as humble as a mouse though my brother does all he can to raise him desires to be in his train as he calls it all the way and never to be from under his wing my brother intends to make a short visit to grandisonhall when he is so near as at lady mansfields dr bartlett will accompany him thither as all the way and hopes he will approve of everything he has done there and in that neighborhood in his absence the good man has promised to write to me emily is sometimes to be with me sometimes with aunt eleanor at the antients request though lord and lady l mutter at it my brothers trusty saunders is to be left behind in order to dispatch to his master by man and horse any letters that may come from abroad and i have promised to send him an account of the healths andsoforth of our northamptonshire friends i think it would be a right thing in him to take a turn to selbyhouse i hope you think so too dont fib harriet  adieu my dear for gods sake be well prays your sister your friend and the friend of all your friends everaffectionate and obliged  charlotte g  letter xliv miss byron to lady g thursday sept   i will write to your letter as it lies before me i do most heartily congratulate you my dear lady g on the arrival of your brother i do not wonder that his fatigues and his disappointment have made an alteration in his person and countenance sir charles grandison would not be the man he is if he had not sensibility  you could not know your brother my dear if you expected from him recriminations on your past odd behavior to lord g i hope he does not yet know a tenth part of it but if he did as he hoped you saw your error and would be good for the future he was right surely to forget what you ought not but with contrition to remember you are very naughty in the letter before me and i love you too well to spare you  what can you mean my dear by exulting so much over your aunt for living to an advanced age a single woman however ineffectual let me add to my former expostulatory chidings on this subject would you have one think you are overjoyed that you have so soon put it out of any ones power to reproach you on the like account if so you ought to be more thankful than you seem to be to lord g who has extended his generosity to you and kept you from the odium upon my word my dear lady g i think it looks like a want of decency in women to cast reflections on others of their sex possibly for their prudence and virtue do you consider how you exalt by your ludicrous freedoms the men whom sometimes you affect to despise no wonder if they ridicule old maids it is their interest to do so lords of the creation sometimes you deridingly call the insulters lords of the creation indeed you make them  and pray do you think that the same weakness which made your aunt grandison tell her dreams in the joy of her heart as an old maid might not have made her guilty of the same foible had she been an old wife joy is the parent of many a silly thing dont you own that the arrival of your brother which made your aunt break out into dreamtelling made you break into laughter even in a letter of which you were ashamed to tell the cause  wives my dear should not sall into the mistakes for which they would make maids the subject of their ridicule you know better and therefore should be above joining the foolish multitude in a general cry to hunt down as you reckon them an unfortunate class of people of your own sex your aunt grandisons dreams let me add were more innocent than your weaking mirth  you must excuse me  i could say a great deal more upon the subject but if i have not said enough to make you sorry for your fault a great deal more would be ineffectual  so much therefore for this subject  poor dear emily  i wonder not at the effect the arrival and first sight of her guardian had upon her tender heart  but how wickedly do you treat your lord  fie upon you charlotte  and fie upon you again for writing what i cannot for your creditsake read out to my friends i wish my dear i could bring you to think that there cannot be wit without justice nor humor without decorum my lord has some few foibles but shall a wife be the first to discover them and expose him for them cannot you cure him of them without treating him with a ridicule which borders upon contempt  o my dear you show us much greater foibles in yourself than my lord ever yet had when you make so bad an use of talents that were given you for better purposes one word only more on this subject  you cannot make me smile my dear when you are thus unseasonable in your mirth henceforth then remember that your excursiveness allow me the word i had a harsher in my head upon old maids and your lord can only please yourself and i will not accept of your compliment why because i will not be a partaker in your fault as i should be if i could countenance your levity  levity harriet  yes levity charlotte  i will not spare you whom do you spare  but do you really think me so ill as you represented me to be to your brother i dont think i am if i did i am sure i should endeavor to put my thoughts in an absolutely new train nor would i quit the hold which at proper times i do let go to reenter the world as an individual who imagines herself of some little use in it and who is therefore obliged to perform with cheerfulness her allotted offices however generally insignificant i may comparatively be  you say you had no thoughts of exciting your brothers attention by your strong coloring when you described the effects of my indisposition to him attention  compassion you might as well have said  i hope not and i am obliged to mr beauchamp for his inference from the cheerfulness that nothing lay upon my mind now though that inference seemed to imply that he thought if he had not made the observation something might have been supposed to lie upon my mind i am much better satisfied that he made it than if sir charles had  upon the whole i cannot but be pleased at two things in your letter the one that sir charles expressed so great a concern for my health the other that you have all promised and that voluntarily and from a sense of the fitness of the measure that everything be left to its natural course  for my sake and for goodnesssake pray let it be so i think the opening as you call it was much very much too warm bless me my dear how i trembled as i read that part  i am not methinks quite satisfied with it though i am with your intention  consider my dear half a heart  a preferred lady  for quality fortune and every merit so greatly preferable  o my charlotte i cannot were the best to happen that can now happen take such exceeding joy as i once could have done in the prospect of that best  i have pride  but let us hear what the next letters from italy say and it will be then time enough if the truly admirable lady shall adhere to her resolution to come with my scruples and drawbacks your aunt grandison is of opinion that she will not adhere who can tell what to say imagination unnaturally heightened may change into one altitude from another i myself sincerely think and have so often said it that an uncharitable mind would perhaps charge me with affectation for it that lady clementina and no other woman can deserve sir charles grandison  adieu my dear pray tell your brother that i never thought myself so ill as your friendly love made you apprehend me to be and that i congratulate you with all my heart and him also it would be an affectation to forbear it which would imply too much on his safe arrival in england but be sure remember that i look upon you and your lord upon my lord and lady l and upon my sweet emily if she sees what i write as guardians of the honor of the punctilio if you please since no dishonour can be apprehended from sir charles grandison of  your and their harriet byron  letter xlv dr bartlett to lady g monday sept    in obedience to your ladyships commands i write but it must be briefly an account of our motions  sir charles would not go out of town till he had made a visit to mr and mrs reeves and enquired after miss byrons health of which he received an account less alarming than we from our love and our fears had given him  we arrived at windsor on wednesday evening my lord and lady w expected him not till the next day  i cannot find words to express the joy with which they received him my lord acknowleged before us all that he owed it to god and to him that he was the happiest man in the world my lady called herself with tears of joy a happy woman and sir charles told me that when he was led by her to her closet to talk about the affairs of her family she exceedingly abashed him by expressing her gratitude to him for his goodness to them all on her knees while he was almost ready on his he said to acknowledge the aunt that had done so much honor to his recommendation and made his uncle so happy  sir charles in order to have leave to depart next morning as soon as he had breakfasted promised to pass several days with them when he could think himself a settled englishman  you madam and lady l equally love and admire lady w i will not therefore enlarge to you on her excellencies everybody loves her her servants as they attend look at their lady with the same delight mingled with reverence as those of my patron look upon him  poor mr grandison could not help taking notice to me with tears on the joint acknowlegements of my lord and lady made to my patron that goodness and beneficence brought with them their own rewards saw you not my good dr bartlett said he how my cousins eyes glistened with modest joy as my lord and lady ran over with their gratitude i thought of him as an angel among men  what a wretch have i been how can i sit at table with him yet how he overwhelms me with his goodness  my patron having heard that sir hargrave pollexfen was at his house on the forest he rode to make him a visit though some few miles out of his way i attended him  sir hargrave is one of the most miserable of men he is not yet fully recovered of the bruises and rough treatment he met with near paris but he is so miserably sunk in his spirits that my patron could not but be concerned for him he received him with grateful acknowlegements and was thankful for his visit but he told him that he was so miserable in himself that he could hardly thank him for saving a life so wretched  mr merceda it seems died about a sortnight ago  that poor man was thought to be pretty well recovered and rode out several times but was taken on his return from one of his rides with a vomiting of blood the consequence as imagined of some inward bruises and died miserably his death and the manner of it have greatly affected sir hargrave  and poor bagenhall sir charles said he is as miserable a dog as i am  sir hargrave understanding as he said that i was a parson begged me to give him one prayer   he was so importunate and for sir charles to join in it that we both kneeled with him  sir hargrave wept he called himself a hardened dog  strange man  but i think i was still more affected sir hargrave shocked me by your noble brothers humanity than by sir hargraves wretchedness tears of compassion for the poor man stealing down his manly cheek  god comfort you sir hargrave said he wringing his hand  dr bartlett is a good man you shall have the prayers of us both  he left him he could stay no longer followed by the unhappy mans blessings interrupted by violent sobbings  we were both so moved that we broke not silence as we rode till we joined our company at my lords  i recounted what passed at this interview to mr grandison your ladyship will not want me to be very particular in relating what were his applications to and reflections on himself when i tell you that he could not have been more concerned had he been present on the occasion  mr beauchamp was with us when i gave this relation to mr grandison he was affected at it and with mr grandisons sensibility but how happy for himself was it that his concern had in it no mixture of self reproach it was a generous and humane concern like that of his dear friend  sir charless next visit was to the good earl of g and here we left my lord g the best natured and one of the most virtuous and prudent young noblemen in the kingdom your ladyship will not accuse me of flattery when you read this but you will perhaps of another view  yet as long as i know that you love to have justice done to my lord and in your heart are sensible of the truth of what i say and i am sure rejoice in it i give cheerful way to the justice and the rather as you look upon my lord as so much yourself that if you receive his praises with some little reluctance it is with such a modest reluctance as you would receive your own glad at the same time that you were so justly complimented  my lord will acquaint your ladyship with all that passed at the good earls and how much overjoyed he and lady gertrude were at the favor they thought your brother did them in dining with them his lordship will tell you also how much they wish for you for they propose to winter there and not in hertfordshire as once they thought to do  here sir charles enquired after their neighbor mr bagenhall  he is become a very melancholy man his wife is as obliging as he will let her be but he hates her and the less wonder for he hates himself  poor woman she could not expect a better fate to yield up her chastity to be forced upon him afterward by way of doing her poor justice what affiance can he have in her virtue were she to meet with a trial  but that is not all for though nobody questions her fidelity yet what weight with him can her arguments have were she to endeavor to enforce upon his mind those doctrines which were they to have proceeded from a pure heart might nowandthen have let in a ray of light on his benighted soul a gloomy mind must occasionally receive great consolation from the interposal and soothing of a companionable love when we know it comes from an untainted heart  poor mr grandison found in this case also great room for selfapplication and regret without my being so officious as to remind him of the similitude though the woman who is endeavored to be imposed on him for a wife is a more guilty creature than ever mrs bagenhall was  and here madam allow me to observe that there is such a sameness in the lives the actions the pursuits of libertines and such a likeness in the accidents punishments and occasions for remorse which attend them that i wonder they will not be warned by the beacons that are lighted up by every brother libertine whom they know and that they will so generally be driven on the same rock overspread and surrounded as it is in their very sight by a thousand wrecks  did such know your brother and learn from his example and history what a variety there is in goodness as he passes on from object to object exercising not officiously but as opportunity offers his noble talents to the benefit of his fellow creatures surely they would like honest mr sylvester the attorney endeavor to give themselves solid joy by following what that gentleman justly called so selfrewarding an example  forgive me madam if sometimes i am ready to preach it is my province who but your brother can make every province his and accommodate himself to every subject  we reached sir harry beauchamps that night and there took up our lodgings  sir harry seems to be in a swift decay and he is very sensible of it he rejoiced to see your brother i was afraid sir charles grandison said he that our next meeting would have been in another world may it be in the same world and i shall be happy  this was a wish a thought not to be discouraged in a dying man sir charles was affected with it you know madam that your brother has a heart the most tender and at the same time the most intrepid of human hearts i have learned much from him he preaches by action till i knew him young man as he then was and still is my preaching was by words i was contented that my actions disgraced not my words  lady beauchamp as my patron afterward told me confessed in tears that she should owe to him all the tranquillity of mind that she can hope for if she survive sir harry o sir said she till i knew you i was a narrow selfish creature i was jealous of a fathers love to a worthy son whose worthiness i knew not as a son and as a friend that was the happiest day of our beauchamps life which introduced him to an intimacy with you  here on friday morning we left mr beauchamp sorrowing for his fathers illness and endeavoring by every tender act of duty to comfort his motherinlaw on a deprivation with which i am afraid she will soon be tried  my beauchamp loves you sir charles said sir harry at parting in the morning after breakfast and so he ought wherever you are he wants to be but spare him to his mother and me for a few days he is her comforter and mine fain very fain would i have longer rejoiced if god had seen fit in the love of both but i resign to the divine will pray for me you also dr bartlett pray for me my son tells me what a good man you are  and may we meet in heaven i am afraid sir charles that i never shall see you again in this world  but why should i oppress your noble heart god be your guide and protector take care of your precious health you have a great deal to do before you finish your glorious course and come to this last period of human vanity  my patron was both grieved and rejoiced  rejoiced to see sir harry in a frame of mind so different from that to which he had been a witness in sir hargrave pollexsen and grieved to find him past all hopes of recovery  sir charles pursued his journey cross the country to lady mansfields we found no convenient place for dining and arrived at mansfieldhouse about five on friday afternoon  my lady mansfield her daughter and sons were overjoyed to see my patron mr grandison told me that he never from infancy to this time shed so many tears as he has shed on this short tour sometimes from joy sometimes from grief i dont know madam whether one should wish him reestablished in his fortune if it could be done since calamity rightly supported is a blessing  here i left my patron and proceeded on saturday morning with mr grandison to the hall if sir charles finds matters ripened for a treaty between the mansfields and their adversaries as he has been put in hopes he will go near to stay at mansfieldhouse and only visit us at the hall incognito to avoid neighbourly congratulations till he can bring things to bear  mr grandison just now told me that sir charles before he left town gave him a  00 l bank note to enable him to pay off his debts to tradesmen of which at his desire he had given him in a list amounting to   0 l  he owes he says  00 l more to the widow of a winemerchant but being resolved to pay it the moment money comes into his hands he would not acquaint sir charles with it  i have the honor to be  your ladyships most faithful and obedient servant ambrose bartlett  end of vol v
