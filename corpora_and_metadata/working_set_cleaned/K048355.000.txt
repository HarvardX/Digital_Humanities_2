a new tale of a tub  a new tale of a tub written for the delight and instruction of every british subject in particular and all the world in general  duplex libelli dos est quod risum movet et quod prudente vitam consilio monet phaedrus london printed for j ridgway no   yorkstreet st jamesssquare     0  the editor unto the christian reader the manuscript copy of the following unaccountable and most surprising work fell into my hands gentle reader by the mere favor of good chance for i being placed at my table eating mine supper sent for some cheese for the same and lo around it were wrapped some leaves of the treatise now presented unto thee my curiosity being stirred i hasted to the cheesemongers and was so fortunate as to redeem the whole except a few leaves which were torn therefrom and which defects i have carefully marked by asterisms  the cheesemonger could give me no essential information concerning the manuscript except that he bought it among others in grubstreet from the effects of a deceast author  the author was without doubt of an elevated turn of mind for he lived in a cockloft as to the treatise it must speak for itself but i cannot help observing that it is not deficient in nonsense and that this gives me the warmest expectations that it will sell like bread  i could after painful endeavors learn nothing further concerning the author of this erudite and diverting work except that he was born and that he died but where and when must be left to the discoveries of future antiquaries  the manuscript had passed through the hands of some learned critics who have marked small annotations which i present unto thee as i found them fruere et vale  a new tale of a tub chapter i birth parentage and education of james tory a vast you critic with the brown face and sharp nose what you are already prying to discover some nakedness are you you are rummaging your pockets for your little rule and line to apply to this sublime treatise but i let you to know that this great and arduous work has so many angles tangents and capricious excrescences that it sets your rule and line at defiance be gone then call for pen ink and paper and write some work of your own  and then write a criticism upon it  and reduce it to your rules  your rules indeed all rules have exceptions and to confirm a proverb i shall tell you a little story  a worthy old gentleman of my acquaintance sick of the gang of town servants hired a raw lad from the country and resolved to tutor him himself so upon the evening of hobnails arrival he was summoned to the parlour and testy began thus i do not wish hob to overload your memory with too many instructions at once but i shall content myself my lad with giving you one at a time and when i see that you practice that then i shall give you another as you are but raw from the country the first lesson i shall give you is to be upon your guard against the roguish deceptions of this vile town in buying make it a general rule never to give above half what is asked hob bowed and retired next morning the postman comes with a letter and asks sixpence hob remembering the rule pours threepence into his hand and the door in his face rat tat a tat goes the knocker again and again so as to alarm the neighborhood and awake my old gentleman to the pangs of the gout from his first slumber the reason of the uproar is asked the story is told d  n you for a fool says old testy do not you know that there is no rule without exceptions  this work mr critic must not be judged by rules but by exceptions and to show you how much i despise your rules i have a strong inclination to begin my tale of a tub at the end and so to walk backwards like a crab to the beginning but hold i shall not allow your rules to put me out of my way neither so i shall begin at the beginning and commence at the commencement lest i fall under the ignorant monks description of a hebrew book item a book which begins at the end  the place and time of james torys birth are strongly contested among the literati some say that he was a relation of nimrod and laid the first stone of the tower of babel that is he was born with the first monarchy warburton  others say that he was the son of one of the patriarchs alluding to filmers patriarchal scheme wherein absolute indefcasible right is derived from the patriarchs warburton  some profound antiquaries as m gebelin m baily dr parsons and colonel vallancey do most strenuously assert that james tory was begot by the devil upon eve and that adam was made a cuckold while he was eating the apple it is not certain whether in was an apple that adam are some suppose the fatal fruit to be the pear called cuisse madame steevens  they also add that satan laid aside his crown of horns upon this occasion that he might not frighten his mistress and that adam clapped it upon his own head and from that memorable hour horns and cuckoldry have been concatenated they also add that the word james in the shamscrit and malabaric languages signifies love and that tory means power  from this have lord monboddo and some other clear metaphysicians concluded that this is a nut and that the kernel of allegory is that satan being kicked out of the upper boxes for his love of power and the same love of power being as chaucer tells the ruling passion indeed the essential form of woman the two loves of power thus coalescing begot a quintessential form of love of power which form was called james tory i hope what i have said is not clear if it be clear the reader has only to submit it by letter to lord monboddo and he will render it as dark as any metaphysical question needs to be the darkness or tenebrancy of metaphysics progenerates from the tenebrificous oscitancy of man johnson   james tory from a child was always fond of riding upon a high horse and looking down upon his equals he used to say that he was a king nay king of kings and some thought him very wise and some thought his brain was not a little deranged he would often tell the little boys his companions that they were but ants and vermin while he was the very image and lieutenant of god they in return told him that he was an unruly brat and only superior to them in pride and uncharitableness and that they knew him better than the mother that bore him this is an evident allusion to the history of john dawson and his mother printed at london       to black letter steevens  he told them he had always a sure argument to convince the refractory they asked for his argument and as he was a stout boy and loved to play with those weaker than himself he would kick them all round and then take their sugar plumbs from them even when grown up this was his chief argument in debate and he called it his argumentum ad puerum for the argumentum ad hominem he did not like and never used  when he came to mansestate he was the loyalest subject the king had he said that kings were the images of god especially inspired by him and infallible that men were made for kings as sheep are made for men that the devil was the first whig and stood at the head of the first opposition a grave man present told him that he was speaking rank blasphemy by comparing the weakness and fallibility of man with the omnipotence and infallibility of his creator that kings had generally two legs and seldom three eyes and that they were not only men but in virtue of their education the weakest of men that till he could prove that kings were endued with all the perfections of the deity  that i shall prove at once said james and knocked the grave man down  but the grave man was a personage of wealth and influence and the consequence was that james was banished  chapter ii how james tory came to england and became manager of an estate james was thus forced to set sail and abandon his native country after many adventures not recorded in this authentic history james was landed in england  his proud humor stuck close by him and exposed him to many disagreeable accidents he was rolled in the kennel at the point of portsmouth for using his argumentum ad pucrum to an english sailor see the ballad of jack and sall steevens  and was tossed into a dung cart for repeating it to a carman  james thought he had got into the infernal regions a learned allusion le roi dangleterre est le roi denfer says a french proverb warburton  and being like other blustering bullies a coward at heart was about to be circumspect when a certain lord made james the manager of an estate  here james was in his element he again called himself the lieutenant of god and oppressed the poor tenants and shared their spoils with the rich ones he became fond of the rich tenants because they supported and shared his extortions  he was also a great usurer and aspiring to get soon rich by this practice as he was one evening smoking a pipe with the parson of the parish he requested the parson to preach against usury the honest clergyman told him that it might he looked upon as a satire against james himself and that he begged to be excused but james insisting violently the parson promised that he would and accordingly next sunday he preached so well against this crying vice that all the usurers in the neighborhood were frightened and gave up the trade so that james got the whole  james though the greatest knave in the parish always affected great piety he would pray and roll up the whites of his eyes in the high way church and king was his constant toast and when he wanted to oppress any poor tenant in an extraordinary way he always took a clergyman with him and gave him part of the spoils and said all that he did was for the service of god and the good of the church  he used to observe that the barbarians who established the feudal system of king and aristocracy and forgot that the people were men were very wise for wisdom could only be found in kings and nobles and clergy and was denied to all else for wise purposes for the people were mere pecora campi and their business was like bees to make honey for the king peers and clergy and then to be singed to death for their pains  chapter iii digression on estates i have always admired what parson adams calls the pedestrian expedition because of the perfect freedom which attends it in a coach or in a chaise one cannot look every way sir and one cannot stop to get out and examine every thing curious an equipage is one of the many miseries of the great and forms one link of the chain of formality which constrains them and prevents that free enjoyment of existence which the great would envy the peasantry for if they had sense enough to form an idea of its delights  in a buggy madam or upon a horse one is forced to attend more to the horse than to the landscape whereas on foot one is quite at ones ease one may step to a ditch to gather a wild flower one may ascend a hill to enjoy a prospect one may descend into a hollow glen to look up at a cascade one may  but hold what may one not do  now this profound work is a species of pedestrian expedition in literature the author is not mounted in the phaeton of poetry nor in the chaise of dissertation nor in the buggy of novelwriting nor upon the horse of criticism and far less in the statecoach of history no sir he is a literary powell only he does not walk for a wager rather he is upon a pedestrian excursion of pleasure and is resolved to see and describe any object which strikes him though it may be a little out of his way the only rule he shall sollow in his digressions and wanderings is not to forget his road and get into a morass  estates are of many kinds but chiefly of three if managed by one person it is an emblem of monarchy if by a few of the richer tenants it is an aristocracy if by all in conjunction for common good it is a democracy  each plan has its faults and its excellencies  faults are  in a monarchy it is ten to one if the manager does not forget that he is made for the tenants and not the tenants for him hence he becomes a tyrant and commands about him without law or reason you fellow you have a fair estate of your own give it to me or i shall put you to death you dick you have a handsome wife you unconscionable dog lend her to me for a night or you shall be hanged in her garters the author is so full of double meanings that i take this to allude to the order of the garter steevens an error of the learned critic the sense is literal warburton    but this is nothing the tenants tremble before their tyrant and get slavish and lazy and cannot have spirits to work so all are unhappy and the estate goes to wreck and is sold to the best bidder perhaps the manager is a weak man and knows it and in this case the tyranny is worse he buys him a certain number of chests with good locks which cannot be picked then by degrees he puts impositions upon the tenants till he squeezes most of their money into the said chests then he employs his cash in bribing the better sort of tenants to do as he pleases and they employ theirs in bribing the inferior class and thus the money of the tenants is employed in bribing them and all is one mass of corruption o fie  give me some civet good apothecary to sweeten mine imagination a general pestilence is not so destructive to mankind as general corruption in a state the one destroys the body the other the soul all honesty is tainted conscience hangs quite wide and loose and is at last cut into shreds and made into a purse this is the worst kind of tyranny and the ne plus ultra of bad government open despotism only degrades the mind but this blackens rots more scientifically it nigrates and putredinates johnson  and annihilates it not to add that in the former the tenants can do nothing against main force while in the latter they have the additional consolation to know that all is owing to their own simplicity and that they are oppressed because they are dupes  the faults of aristocratical management are chiefly that here are many tyrants instead of one and the evil increases in proportion one may escape the attention of one tyrant but a number forms an argus with a hundred eyes alluding to the inscription which a gentleman put upon his library hic argus esto non briarius steevens  and nothing escapes them my neighbor may be one of the tyrants and may take a fancy to my garden if the aristocracy be hereditary it is still worse than if elective for the latter will stand upon character will run after the shadow of fame while the members of the former may be gamblers and horsejockeys what then they are born better than other men their very vices and faults are entitled to respect and they are universally respected and imitated o ho says beelzebub this is my own invention i have a patent for it yes infernal demon what plan could contribute so much to people your domains as to institute a hereditary order of right honorable vices to attract the respect and imitation of all mankind  the faults of a democracy in managing an estate consist chiefly in its envy of merit for as all are equal the people think that merit and abilities are also equally shared among them which will never be the case and if superior merit appear all join in an ostracism against it this management likewise tends much to anarchy and anarchy to tyranny nay a democracy if not very wisely adjusted is often the worst of all tyrannies exerted against particular classes of its own members contrariorum eadem est ratio which means madam that if you will bend a serpent round and put its tail in its mouth the head and tail will become all one let us not however confound a plethocracy plethocracy is from the greek  the mob warb with a democracy the government of the mob with the government of the people the mob in modern countries is in political consideration of the same account with the slaves in greece and rome not that they should be real slaves but on the contrary as free and happy as their station and education will permit but as the ancient slaves they should hold no share of government even in a democracy the reason is their want of education the violence of their passions and the weakness of their reason they are perpetual children and not even to be trusted with the management of themselves lest they should do themselves harm a democracy should consist of the middle ranks of people and its superiority to other forms arises from this that the middle class is always the most enlightened and the most rational of the community neither giddy with power and wealth nor debased by the frozen hand of penury  now for excellencies  those of a monarchy are            hiatus valde deflendus        those of an aristocracy i never could discover  those of a democracy consist in its being the only form which preserves all the dignity of man not only so but gives him additional dignity ennobles the man and leads to great thoughts and great actions genius of athens where art thou but stop athens contained only about thirty thousand people and what has the government of so small a state to do with that of millions certain it is that plato and aristotle and cicero in their theoretic republics formed no idea probably could form no idea of a republic extended beyond the bounds of one city yet pedants apply their maxims to modern states as if my little boy there god bless him should pretend to manage a warhorse because he can ride a hobbyhorse see the history of whittington and his cat      black letter steevens  holland and venice are not republics but aristocracies switzerland the same america consists of federative republics perhaps it may be one republic but it is not yet tried let france try the experiment which we look on it is a dangerous experiment a democracy of twentyfour millions would be a phenomenon in human history let them try let us mend our own ways and wait  chapter iv first appearance of will whig james tory proceeded in the management of the estate as you have heard he was a bullying dog and abused every body without opposition if he appeared off went the hats of the tenants and down they bowed lower than to the rector wrong for the spiritual power was always above the temporal see my alliance of church and state warburton   but james was always for more and more respect till at last his pride arose to such a pitch that he said he was gods vicegerent and as such must never be approached without a degree of adoration and every knee must be bent in his presence  now the bending of the knee depends considerably as natural historians observe upon the flexibility of the muscles and suppleness of the joints and as ceremonialists remark upon the cleanness of the floor where the knee is to be bent  both these circumstances operated against the requisition of james the knees of the farmers were very stiff and were bent with much the same facility as those of an elephant james was dirty as well as proud and his floors were none of the cleanest so the farmers began to be clamorous and a meeting was called when a clever young fellow got up and spoke thus  we are informed in scripture my friends that pride was not made for man it is so heterogeneous to his nature and condition that if introduced into his frame it saps the very powers of reason by slow but sure degrees it is like cider which intoxicates by inflation it is a windy complaint and if not emitted downwards flies to the brain and swells it with extravagant schemes if many a great conqueror and rattling blade had had able physicians the world would never have been troubled with them it appears to me under favor that a strong carminative has become absolutely necessary to our manager james tory as i know a little of medicine i shall prepare a carminative draught and carry it to him myself  the farmers were all pleased with this motion and gave will whig for this was the young mans name full power to prepare and administer the said carminative potion to james tory in their names  will soon got the draught ready and being admitted to the presence of james addressed him in such terms as these  mr james the tenants upon this estate being informed by evident symptoms that you are much troubled with a windy complaint called pride have desired me to present this potion to you which will prove a speedy and effectual cure  james was so convulsed with rage that at first he could neither speak nor move but when he recovered the use of his tongue and of his hands he employed the former in calling will a thousand ugly names and the latter in throwing the potion in his face and breaking the pot on his head  as will was prepared for such a reception he contented himself with tripping up the heels of james and left him sprawling upon his dirty floor  chapter v of the family of the whigs when a man makes any figure one feels a natural desire to know who he is and all about him as in this delightful and instructive treatise the author has made it is humble endeavor to please his reader in all his lawful desires he now stops to give such information as he can recover concerning will whig  as to the parentage of will there are many disputes among the antiquaries and genealogists some say that the family was originally of greek extraction others say roman because the abhorrible essence of whiggism is deducted by many from the revivescence of erudition and the liberate spirit of the greek and roman authors johnson  these reports perhaps arose among ignorant people from the circumstance that will was a great greek and latin scholar  some orientalists will have it that the family was tyrian others carthaginian certainly the latter government was considerably democratic see polybius who imputes the fall of carthage to its democracy and the rise of rome to its aristocracy warburton  but oriental scholars are fond of vague conjecture and seldom sacrifice to good sense  after much lucubration and great examination of this subject i am inclined to think that the whig family came to this country from the woods of germany their features and manners agreed so perfectly with the description of the ancient germans given us by that wag tacitus that i have little doubt upon this score and the constant tradition of the family confirms this idea if the reader will not believe me let him to use the style of dr bentley go and think for himself and be d  d i remember i once convinced a great antiquary that the whigs were of german extract after all my other arguments had failed by telling him that will whig always used both hands to buckle his shoes as the germans generally do an argument must be accommodated to the auditor intellectus est in intelligente ad modum intelligentis warburton  see  s travels  will whigs ancestors were once in great repute and managed this very farm now oppressed by james tory because among our ancestors the germans the people were the sole fountain of power see tacitus in germania warburton  but they afterward fell back in the world and had lived in poverty and neglect for many generations  wills father was a plain industrious husbandman and his mother a comely clean old woman as good a manager as ever trod in shoes but withal as good a scold as ever wore out a tongue  as will was their only son and a promising youth they had made a shift to give him a good education at school and college whence he imbibed a spirit superior to that of any young farmer in the neighborhood and his father always said that the boy would do honor to the family  will was a tall handsome lad with a ruddy complexion and yellow hair there seems hardly a line in this profound work but what has as allegorical meaning and there is little doubt but the wellknown features of the ancient germans are here alluded to warburton the author rather seems to me to allude to the song of the yellowhaired laddie steevens    with his friends he was as gentle as a child but upon the sight of oppression or cruelty of any kind he was as bold as the oaken stick he constantly wore many a servant of james tory did he thrash handsomely for attempting to take the hens of old women and to use freedoms with the young nay when one of them was going to steal a blind mans dog will almost murdered him in short he was the universal protector and all who were injured came to will for help or advice will would have terebrated his temporary intervals more sapiently in revolving the sacrific scripture and learning a submissive demeanance to the higher potencies johnson  at the least specimen of injustice his blood would boil and at any tale of generosity tears would leap from his eyes  chapter vi digression on pedigrees ladies are apt to smile at the perusal of genealogies no wonder they are in the secret  when a certain monarch was told that in such a family there had not occurred one instance of female frailty he answered the family cannot be ancient  the pedigree of the whig family we have not given because we could not find it in the records we believe however with the heralds that every man in it was the son of his father and know to a certainty that every woman was the daughter of her own mother  the pedigrees even of the royal families of europe extend not beyond  00 years or poor  0 generations and yet how many mistakes are in them only known to the ladies welsh and irish pedigrees extend to the flood and to adam their women were apparently very chaste  or their genealogists very foolish  charming sex from which arise all our pleasures worthy of that name how can you take such delight in puzzling a poor devil of a genealogist  chapter vii digression upon old books and old wigs many an old book have i looked into in order to discover the genealogy of the whigs and a good old wig did i burn by stooping heedlessly near my lamp in the intenseness of my lucubration this chapter shall therefore treat of old wigs and old books by way of memorial  an old wig and an old book may be compared together for both sit easy the wig has already gone through all the twistings and trials necessary to make it keep close and comfortable to the head and the book has passed the fiery trials of the critics and one does not read it to find fault but to learn  a library of old books may be considered as inhabited by the souls of all the authors do you wish to converse with a soul and to gather its best and most refined thoughts take down its book  a new book like a fine lady must be approached with great delicacy that you may not discompose its prim appearance and rich dress an old book like an old friend may be used with no ceremony you may toss it like an old wig where ever you please                              hiatus in codice          this defect in the manuscript is to be regretted for there seems to be no doubt but the author here gave a catalogue of all the black letter pamphlets published in the sixteenth century steevens   chapter viii how will whig opposed james tory let me return to my subject it may easily be believed that after the adventure which has been narrated james tory singled out will whig for the object of his most cordial detestation nor was will wanting in return  james did every thing in his power to mortify will and will wrote satires upon james and sent them all over the parish james could not punish will because it was not then discovered that truth was a libel  but the enmity between them was further exasperated upon the following occasions  james as the reader has been told was very pious and a pious knave is the worst of all for a common knave pays some respect to common rules but a pious knave has no rule but his internal feelings and sets all human laws and social decencies at defiance nor is it a crime to cheat the ungodly  now james in his great piety and christian charity formed a book of prayers for children surely an allusion to the book of common prayer proposes to the church of scotland in the reign of charles the first and which was the first spring of the grand rebellion warburton  and would insist upon this book being used by the dissenting tenants though they thanked him and said they could pray very well he swore a great oath that if they would not kneel to him they should at least kneel to god they became angry and said they would not kneel because it was pagan and an invention of antichrist and that they believed that james himself was but a bastard of the whore of babel will whig laughed at all this but encouraged them in their obstinacy because useful to him in his designs against james tory wise men sometimes encourage the folly of others because it serves their purposes  this dispute was terminated by an old woman who threw a joint stool at the head of james tory this was really the well known termination of this great scheme warburton  james was carried home in bad plight and never had courage to revive his scheme  but as his hot head was fertile in projects he resolved to build a boat for his amusement when he went a fishing and to make all the tenants contribute to the expense of this boat this allegory must refer to the ship money affair another spring of the grand rebellion warburton  this turned out still worse than the praying scheme for as philosophers justly observe a mans purse is the most sensitive part about him and he will defend it at the risque of his life the tenants were all alarmed and saw that if they yielded to this demand it would become a precedent for future exactions a meeting was called and will whig took the chair it was resolved with only two dissentient voices not to pay a penny  james being informed of this meeting came to it with some soldiers to seize upon will whig is this the visit of charles i to the house of commons in order to seize the refractory members warburton the dubiety of the erudite commentator is a proof of somnolency for the appearance is clarificous johnson    but will had escaped before his arrival  matters now came to the last extremity between james and will both had followers and many skirmishes and some sharp battles happened between them but will at the end got the better and shut james up in his house not to appear upon pain of a broken head  the question now was how to manage the estate and as in all ferments the scum is apt to get uppermost so it happened here some of the dissenting tenants were the worst fanatics that were ever blown up like empty bladders with crazy enthusiasm these having attained great reputation among the rest for their superior sanctity now made use of their religious reputation to persuade the others that religion and honesty were all one that as they were the most religious they were also the most honest and so ought for common benefit to be preferred to the management of the estate the government of those fanatics who constituted the commonwealth of england warburton   but no sooner were they installed than they showed that their religion was but a cloak for selfinterest bayles famous problem that atheism is less hurtful to society than superstition was verified at once every one was guided by his own inward light and guided to actions which in others would have been esteemed diabolical but as they were the deeds of the godly were all holy the inward light was so variously refracted and reflected in their mental prisms and mirrors that it proved a mere wildfire and led them into morasses where they would strip themselves naked and dance in the mud to the no small merriment of the byestanders and yet the light of reason they never would use calling it a farthing candle which might be had in every shop  at last one of them who was a very cunning and clever fellow oliver cromwell warburton  and only a pretender to the inward light with the assistance of some soldiers seized upon these fanatics and shut them up in dark cells after procuring their consent in presence of the tenants that he should manage the estate himself  will whig was not a little astonished to find a new manager in full possession and with all the tyrannical powers and dispositions of james tory will resolved not to allow one of his comrades to be his lord and master and with the assistance of the old soldiers he turned him out and james tory taking advantage of the tumult got his place again  chapter ix how james tory turned papist and got upon a high horse and rode to the devil all this was effected so speedily that will whig had not time nor opportunity to cause james tory to sign a bond for a more equitable management of the estate before he was put again into his office  the consequence was that james instead of being grateful for the unexpected restitution of his place was exasperated at the ill usage he had met with anal now looked upon all the tenants as his enemies his anger at the dissenting tenants in particular was extreme and from mere opposition to their calvinistic tenets he resolved to turn roman catholic he found that religion very convenient because he might commit any crime he pleased and be pardoned at once by confessing it to his priest  at first he was contented to go to mass privately and did not much like to be seen by any of the tenants he became more close and insidious than ever and was always forming plots against will and will sometimes returned the compliment alluding to the mealtub plot and other plots in the reign of charles ii warburon the  in which the plot was found is now in the colction of mr pegge but it wants the bottom and sides steevens    james was now as has been observed particularly irritated against the dissenting tenants who worshipped a certain stern and bloody idol called calvin he would sometimes set the law at defiance in his eager revenge against them and would proceed to such lengths as to burn their houses nay to cut off an ear or two of the proprietors if he could catch them at an unguarded hour but as the ears of all fanatics are particularly large and long and of very vigorous growth this was no great oppression  but he proceeded to still greater extremities against the poor worshippers of calvin he would insist that every one of them should say god save james tory and when they refused he caused them to be put into diverse torturing engines till the poor devils were all in blood and had every joint of their body dislocated  will whig whose generous heart could not bear to see even folly and fanaticism crushed by oppression warmly took their part and going to the presence of james who was then dallying with a favorite mistress an allusion to the whoremongership of charles ii warburton  he spoke to him thus  what business have you sir with any mans opinion any more than with the color of his coat if he pays his rent and does not disturb his neighbors is it not enough do not you know that opinions vary as much as faces and must i give up a part of my long nose to mend your short one do as you would be done by in the devils name and let every man use his wife and his opinion as he pleases how would you like sir to have your opinions subject to those of another and has not any man of opposite opinion the same right to quarrel with you as you have to quarrel with him suppose i am a deist and adore but one god am not i as rational as you who adore three and yet would kill any polytheist if you could catch him a truce then with your persecution of these poor devils and learn that to persecute any society is the way to increase and condense it if you wish them to change their opinions let them alone and neglect and time will effect what persecution can never do look at this snowball which i have brought as an emblem for your instruction if you will imprison it in your cellar it will last for ever but put it in the genial warmth of the sun and it will melt and vanish away  d  n your snowballs said james in great rage would you pretend to instruct me how to manage get along you tatterdemallion out of my sublime presence this moment  will was going to reply but seeing some of james myrmidons at hand he thought it prudent to retreat and wait for a fitter opportunity of taking his revenge  james now thought himself above all contradiction and to show the tenants how much he despised all that they could say he bought unto himself a high horse and rode to mass publicly the allegory is here so plain as to require no interpretation warburton   this grieved even those tenants who had hitherto befriended james and all muttered their discontent they resolved to carry their complaints to the lord of the estate and he at their request consented that if james would not behave as he ought he should be deprived  but james far from altering his behavior was occupied with quite a new and odd idea proceeding as some suppose from mere intoxication  not contented with going to mass himself he would insist that all the tenants should go to mass and ordered them all upon pain of death to believe that a crust of bread was the leg of a duck is this transubstantiation warburton this transubstantiationality is so longitudinous a word or effation that i must consess my predilection for its verbosity and quintessentialness it had been a superior consideration for old england to have manducated this leg of a duck than to have been matter of manducation to rats johnson     the tenants seeing james so far gone clapped him upon his high horse and conducting him out of the bounds of the estate they wished him a good journey  chapter x how will whig became manager of the estate upon this great event a meeting was called and it was agreed that will whig should be recommended to the lord as the properest person to manage the estate the lord consented and will was installed accordingly  will promised great things but the tenants were so angry with james for wanting them to go to mass and to believe that a crust of bread was the leg of a duck that this insult was uppermost in their thoughts and they made it almost the only article in their agreement with will that he should never insist upon these subjects will could not help laughing at their simplicity when it lay in their power to prescribe any terms to him and very cheerfully promised not to desire them to act or believe in such matters but as they wished  will began his management in a tolerable manner the good of the tenants was always in his mouth and yet their good was often sacrificed to that of frogland as the author gets into more modern affairs i always understand his allegory but dare not and happily need not explain it warburton the caution of the learned critic surprises me for the author palpably alludes to homers battle of the frogs and mice steevens  warburton is rectitudinous and the obsuscance of the second commentator is stupendous johnson    a neighboring parish where will had some relations will however by a formal deed confirmed all the tenants of the estate in their rights and provided against future encroachments  as the tenants were surrounded with bad neighbors who would come when an opportunity offered and steal their effects will insisted that a body of watchmen should be provided at the common expense and that he should be their leader and paymaster the oldest tenants in vain represented that this was giving will too much power and that watchmen were the worst of all thieves the measure was carried a standing army warburton   the consequence was that will became more powerful than james tory had ever been a body of watchmen attended him every where and will began to forget his equals  chapter xi how will whig increased the rents and employed them in bribery alas what heart or head can bear the giddy elevation of power power is like an intoxicating liquor the more that is drank the more is called for till at last the drinker is lost in absolute stupor such is the effect of power that most of the royal races in the world have terminated in imbecility witness among others the two first regal progenies of france and the saxon races of england which began with men of talents and terminated with saints  even will whig as honest a lad as ever breathed with a heart as warm as summer and a head as cool as autumn could not withstand the inflating draught of power  he soon begun to dress himself so like james tory that it was hardly possible to distinguish them at a distance the tenants were all surprised at the change but soon learned at their expense that a manager will be a manager  instead of his old familiar intercourse with the tenants will never went out but with a troop of his watchmen about him as much as to say keep your distance instead of his old hearty laugh he would hardly deign to smile and he forbad the tenants to have any puppetshows before he had seen them lest the puppets should mimic the change of his behavior the act for restraining the freedom of the stage warburton s  he took such a liking to a piece of ground he had in a country called henland lying beyond frogland that he would often retire there and waste the rents of the estate in idle frolics nay he has been heard to declare that he would at any time sacrifice the management of the estate to the interests of henland  upon pretense of the necessity of a greater number of watchmen to defend the property of the tenants he raised new contributions and then sent the watchmen to defend his own ground in henland the tenants began to murmur but their murmurs were increased when will whig upon various pretenses raised all the rents of the estate  james tory dared not to venture upon such a trying measure for he was sensible that the tenants hated him and might murder him if he gave such great provocation but will was so much persuaded of the confidence which the tenants reposed in him that he thought they would oppose no measure of his  the tenants however were very clamorous upon this occasion and will found it absolutely necessary to use effectual means to pacify them  for this purpose he called some of the richer tenants to his cabinet and told them that he did not mean to have the sole profit of these exorbitant rents but that if they would support his cause he should give each of them a share of the emoluments the rich tenants greedily assented to the proposal and will said that he found every man had his price  the tenants who before were an honest good sort of people soon became the wickedest set in the world an universal corruption took place their time which was formerly employed in useful labor and rural recreations was now spent in alehouses and gambling  no management can be carried on without influence and money is the surest influence became an universal maxim among the tenants the wiser shook their heads and said that a secret and mysterious management for the interest of a few individuals indeed required influence of a particular kind but an open and liberal plan of management calculated for the benefit of all required no influence but the good opinion of the greater part of the tenants which was sure to attend it  mankind said they have always been used as children by their governors nothing can be more simple than a good government nothing more complex than a bad frankness incites confidence and mystery annuls it secrecy in government is useless either to friends or enemies wax is a system of wickedness and therefore secrecy should attend its projects but in peace no government should have mysteries and most especially not to its own people a king should come forward and say my people my friends your good is mine our interests are one i have no projects but for your happiness i shall tell you freely what i mean to do and do you tell me freely what you with  thus did they compare their grounds to a kingdom and surely the government of both should be equally simple and for the common good  will however still had his own way at first he used to follow the wishes of the tenants but now he had only to propose a scheme and it was carried by a majority  some of the tenants however were left virtuous because will could not afford to bribe all they began frankly to tell will that he was as great a knave as james tory and paid as little attention to the good of the tenants and that they would call back james if he did not reform  are not you a great rogue said one of them to will to oppress those very people who made you manager think on the carminative draught which you exhibited to james tory and take one yourself for you need it as for james he was born a tyrannous fellow and we never knew him otherwise but for you one of us a creature of our own making to follow his example nay to oppress us more than he did you shall be taught better manners in faith  will only laughed and asked them what other manager they had in embryo  chapter xii how james tory opposedd will whig in the disposition of this sublime work the author has always been obliged to sacrifice the haut gout of fancy to the insipidity of truth fiction that goddess of flowers can sprinkle them as she pleases and make a parterre of a wilderness but truth has only her mirror and can only show objects as they really are  if therefore the incidents in this work appear monotonous let it be considered that truth makes them so and will not permit madam fancy to use her magical wand  not all the mirth of rabelais can equal that of the tenants when james tory unexpectedly made his appearance among them one day at a fair he was mounted upon an ass and from that convenient pulpit or rostrum made a speech to the tenants  he told them how much he had been misrepresented in his absence as he learned from the friends he yet had on the estate he asked them what they had gained by exchanging his administration for will whigs had he taken any carminative draught himself had he not shown more pride and exerted more oppression than their old manager and what title has he to be proud if i was proud and perhaps am have i not a title  at this moment an unlucky boy clapping a thistle apparently an allusion to the scottish rebellion of      or      warburton under suddenly and landed james in the mud  a great laugh arose but some of the tenants who were still friendly to james or thought him a fit tool for their purposes against will whig helped him up and cleaned him and afterward resolved to maintain him among them and give him a cottage to live in  james was soon at all the secret meetings which the discontented tenants held to concert measures against the oppression of will whig and as adversity teaches wisdom he became a formidable opponent to the manager  he retaliated all wills old invectives against his management upon that of will he spoke much of the public good and of liberty and property the farmers were as much transported at the change of james torys sentiments as they would have been at the finding wine in a smallbeer barrel and believed james to be quite a reformed man james only wanted to regain the management  will whig endeavored to introduce excisemen into the parish but james mustered his opposition so effectually that will had almost been torn in pieces and he was glad to relinquish the scheme  nothing could be more ludicrous than to see james tory mounted upon his ass this alludes to baaam and his ass steevens an error surely for no angel is mentioned as inspiring the ass of james tory the ass is apparently a mere symbol of ignorance and obstinacy warburton  and bawling for liberty except the infatuation of the farmers who believed him in carnest  chapter xiii digresson upon opposition what is called opposition in great matters is in small called contradiction a quality with which every master of a family must be tolerably well acquainted  the spirit of contradiction in a family is generally of the feminine gender and it is well known that it does not proceed so much from a desire of liberty as from a desire of power  this is also very often the case with opposition in a political sense  one would imagine that if every man in an assembly voted according to his conscience he would hardly in any two questions find himself exactly in the same company yet it so happens in some great assemblies that the same body of men will ever propose questions and another body acting as one man always oppose them it is an obvious point that neither body has any conscience or attends to the public good  this will further appear when we consider that put the one body of men upon the right side of the house and the others opposite in a word make them change places and the very same measures will be proposed by the opposing body and opposed by the proposing  no point in natural philosophy has so much puzzled the adepts as this  some think it proceeds from animal magnetism and imagine that there must be a principle of attraction upon one side of the house and of repulsion upon the other  others suppose that the whole mystery proceeds upon the principles of electricity and that as the ancients believed that when it thundered upon the right hand it was a happy omen but when upon the left unfortunate so in this case the electric fire of eloquence is regarded as fortunate on the right and unfortunate upon the left and as when men sit facing the right hand of the one is in opposition to the left of the other each body turns to the right and so the assembly constantly opinionates and divides as the members happen to sit q e d  but others not contented with this solution account for the fact in this way they suppose that there is suspended in a net fixed to the roof of the house a certain number of purses and patents to which the members are constantly looking up and as they cannot ascend to reach the said net except by mutual assistance and by forming themselves into such pyramids of men as are shown at sadlers wells it is necessary that each body should keep together for the benefit of all its members nay as at sadlers wells if one man of the pyramid were to dissent from the others in any motion it would ruin the pyramid such is nearly the case here  one of these pyramids of men is commonly called a ministry and the other an opposition the man at the top of the former is king for the time and can easily reach at the patents and purses and hand them down to those who support him the latter pyramid is so short that the man at the top cannot reach to the net till he can persuade some of the bottom supporters of the other pyramid to lend a hand to his  a ministry is vulgarly defined to be a body of men who impose taxes upon the people that the ministry may be enabled to bribe their representatives this is called the perfection of government and by some the english constitution  in this excellent plan of government it is necessary that the people be dupes else they will be apt to laugh at the idea of being bribed with their own money they will say we shall not pay enormous taxes to enable you to govern arbitrarily by bribery no relieve us of our taxes and govern arbitrarily by power deliver us from our representatives and from the taxes we pay to bribe them and govern us as you please as indeed you do at any rate  as to an opposition it has been briefly defined a set of men who with to be ministers  liberty and the public good are names for certain pills sold both by ministerial and antiministerial quackdoctors and are thought a sovereign cure for the jaundice sore eyes and other political evils  but as the ministerial quacks generally set up their carriages and live at their ease they commonly leave the said pills and other little medicines to be sold by the quacks of opposition who would otherwise be at a loss how to live and il faut vivre  an opposition mountebank gets often upon a stage called the hustings where he eats fire and vomits flame and handles serpents and all for the public good over his head is a board inscribed liberty and property and after a speech in much the following terms he sells his medicines and machines  gentlemen hem hem i do not come here for private emolument whatever evildisposed people may say but for the public good hem hem for liberty gentlemen d  n me hem hem the public good gentlemen is as i take it hem hem a sort of a

potabile of politics a great favorite with all parties if you will give a man a drop of this in a morning he may pick pockets all day long and yet never be discovered  this little box contains a most precious ointment for all who itch after places and pensions only rub your thumb with it and you will find a patent in your pocket  here is an invaluable parcel of caustic powder for weak consciences only rub the conscience with it every evening when going to bed and you will not only never have bad dreams or tormenting reflections but your conscience will get quite seared and you may do with it whatever you please if you do not cut it out and sell it to a pawnbroker as many of my friends have done and yet never suffered any inconvenience  look gentlemen here is a viol of liquor worth its weight in diamonds only throw a little of it in the faces of the spectators and their sight will be so confounded that they shall look upon you as quite a different person from what you really are miss  will appear the most modest of women mr  the most honest of mankind a jesuit shall seem a patriot a madman a philosopher a highway man a methodist preacher this is called the cozening liquor gentlemen and is very rarely to be got for the ministry generally buy all they can procure  this gentlemen is a political barometer for the regulation of the stocks if the mercury begins to fall sell

you see all the designs of the minister in their just light in vain shall he cover them with the wool of secrecy or draw the curtain of dissimulation it is composed of euphrasy and rue gentlemen as our great poet says  then purged with euphrasy and rue the visual nerve for he had much to see   here is my grand secret the infallible murmuring trumpet gentlemen which may be heard from one extremity of the british empire to the other and yet the sound is little louder than a whisper this is the grand machine for spreading scandal against a minister and discontent against his government often at the sound of it has a minister fallen to the ground as the walls of jericho did before the trumpets of israel  this gentlemen is a viol of ink of a very black sort and not apt to wash out of peculiar use in the composition of libels  here is a private printing press constructed upon such expeditious principles that it will throw off a thousand handbills in a minute it is not served by printers devils but by real devils which have been bound to it by my great friend whom i have always in my eye the magician grominagrobus  look at this large pair of bellows gentlemen they are formed of the lungs of stentor and of a great senator conjoined their effect upon the windmill of public good i can assure this honorable audience from experience is quite stupendous and amazing from mere strength of explosion they will turn it even against the wind of eloquence  this gentlemen is a box of sugarplumbs not for children no they are used by some members who call them witticisms and scatter them in the house when they have nothing else to do  lastly here is a rattle equal to any horselaugh in the world to confound an opponent when we cannot confute him  the rabble greedily buy up the quacks articles and give him notes payable in the course of seven years which he receives at the treasury of the ministry or of the opposition as the windmill turns with a thousand per cent interest  chapter xiv how will whig proved that a high horse is a low one will whig got prouder and prouder every day at last nothing would serve him but he must have a high horse as james tory had in his management and rightly for i can assimilate no conception of a manager who has not a horse of great altitude see my taxation no tyranny johnson   a great war horse was accordingly got lord how he did stamp and foam and rear and terrify old maids in dark nights he overturned two old women and snorted at a ploughboy these two old women are the witch of endor and sarah gubbins whose story was printed at london       vo black letter steeven a mistake the two old women i do not choose to explain but the ploughboy is the landed interest wareurton     will however proceeded with some prudence in this momentous affair he convened most of the tenants at a public house and made them tipsey with rumbo cider and stingo when it began to get dark he sent for his high horse and led the tenants out to see it  my friends says will i know that it is reported by my enemies that i have got as high a horse as ever james tory had but as you are grave and sober men i wish to convince you of the contrary before i begin to ride him do look at him gentlemen and you will find that he is so far from being a high horse that he is as low a horse as any man of my size can ride without having his feet in the dirt which would neither be for my honor nor yours nor that of the estate which i have the honor to manage  it is so dark that we can see nothing said one of the tenants  do handle him then gentlemen said will feeling is the truth  one of the tenants accordingly went up to the horses forequarters and another to his hind but d  n the horse resounded at once from both ends the horse bit the one and kicked the other  the tenants seeing this did not care to run any further risque but said they would take wills word as to the size of the horse and immediately signed a paper which will presented to them testifying to all whom it might concern that the horse was not the highest horse in the world but such a horse as will found it absolutely necessary to ride  will also bought of a quack some cozening liquor and threw it in the eyes of the tenants so that all believed that the horse was rather of the lowest  chapter xv how james tory supplanted will whig in the management the tenants were after all that had past not disatisfied so much with will whigs management as they had been with that of james tory for will with all his faults had done more toward the real improvement of the estate in a few years than james had done in his long management all the great and publicspirited schemes which had ever been entered into by the tenants originated in wills noddle  james tory was however using all the arts he could to undermine will and art was the chief talent of james whereas will was upon the whole a frank open fellow and too wise to be cunning except now and then to guard against james and then with a fox he was a fox and a half  james found however that he made some progress in the good will of the tenants because he got and kept together a number of them who opposed will in some points prejudicial to their interests but he could not hope to get the management again as long as will kept all his senses about him and he was forming schemes how to administer to will a strong opiate when an accident gave him all the advantage which he could desire  will was riding his high horse one morning that is allegoricaly at the beginning of a new reign warburton  when lo at the turning of a lane stood james torys ass eating thistles  wills horse started and reared and threw his master with great violence who fell upon his head and was taken up so much hurt that his life was despaired of he was long dangerously ill and would certainly have died if he had had a physician  james in the mean while availed himself of the illness of will and as no other person offered the lord appointed and the tenants reluctantly consented that james should resume the management  chapter xvi how james bribed and swore and lied james tory found the greater part of the tenants so adverse to his administration that he was forced to improve upon will whigs plan of bribery hardly was there left a tenant upon the estate who did not fall a prey to saintseducing gold  he pretended that he forgave all his old enemies and that there should be no more parties upon the estate but he always employed his old friends and did not like the adherents of will whig he would however send the latter upon any dangerous business that if it failed they might bear the blame whereas if it succeeded he knew that he should have all the praise with the additional same of being candid and impartial  he swore solemnly and repeatedly that he was an honest man and encouraged swearing so much by rule that no tenant could sell a pennyworth of snuff without swearing that it was right snuff and paid excise swearing proceeded to such a pitch that at last the tenants came one night and burned the pillory and agreed that every man should swear what he pleased  this was the more surprising as james was always a pretender to great piety and upon the resumption of his office he renewed his acquaintance with the parson of the parish and turned up the whites of his eyes as before  adversity had indeed taught james a little moderation but at bottom he was still the same man will whig had carried many dangerous measures by art and persuasion but james was always for force d  n you do you oppose my sovereign will was his common expression to unruly tenants even in bribery instead of putting a purse of gold into a tenants pocket he would often throw it at his head and knock him down with it  withal he was a monstrous liar he indeed no longer insisted that the tenants should believe a crust of bread to be the leg of a duck but he would tell them that a notorious knave was an honest man that a highwayman was the fittest person to be a justice of peace because he had experience of business and the like he would also boldly assert that the moon was made of green cheese and that will whig was an enemy of the estate he said that the greatest part of mankind were made to be driven to market by the less and that it was a vulgar error to suppose that rivers rose from springs and ran to the sea while he could demonstrate that rivers rose from the sea and run up the land losing their saltness by the filtration of their progress an allusion to misconceptions on the origin of government warburton   he was quite a jesuit in politics and had always two faces under a mask he said there was a certain oil without the influence of which the wheels of no government could roll and that this oil was money forgetting that no oil is necessary except the wheels be rusty  he squeezed the rents to the utmost pitch an pretense of the good of the estate though it was well known that he did this for the purpose of bribery and his own profit  chapter xvii how james lost a part of the estate there was a large extent of ground belonging to the estate which lay upon the further side of a large river and was chiefly inhabited by the worshippers of calvin james hated this worship cordially for he was at heart a roman catholic and a great favourer of catholics the tenants of this part had however in some degree escaped the rapacity of james because being at a distance his authority over them was not so immediate  james wishing to gain all he could and forgetting that his masters claim to that part of the estate was a little dubious endeavored to rack the rents of its tenants he visited them in person for that purpose but only got a bloody nose upon which he commenced an action of battery against the tenants and they countersuited him by an indictment for attempting privately to steal from their persons  will whig who had been well for some time and had opposed james torys new management as usual began to appear with great vehemence upon this occasion he had not opposed james when he racked the tenants rents on this side the river because he was afraid of the argument adverecundiam and chiefly because he was in hopes of having the management again in which case the racked rents would have been useful to him and his friends but he saw plainly that in the present case james had the wrong sow by the tail and that he was running a risk of losing part of the estate by mere greediness  as will foresaw so it came to pass the tenants on the further side of the river irritated by the tyrandic spirit of james declared that his management did not extend to that part of the estate and after a troublesome lawsuit james was nonsuited and the tenants beyond the river were declared freeholders  chapter xviii how james and will formed a coalition it might have been expected that this mortification would have been of essential service to james by the abatement of his pride but james was one of those who if they are pounded in a mortar as says the holy scripture will be still the same he could not part with his high horse not he  will whig had still so strong a party that he not a little embarrassed james in his management in fact their squabbles had such an effect that the tenants neglected their industry and nothing could be done for the benefit of the estate  a cunning fellow called solomon cacataba observing this and that the wiser sort of the tenants were sick both of james and will aspired to the management himself representing to the lord the disatisfaction of the tenants he procured a mandate appointing him manager  james and will hearing of this hung their ears and james proposed to will to have a meeting at a public house  after a hearty drink and a game at cards james addressed himself thus to will it is truly ridiculous my lad for you and me to struggle about the management and thus give an upstart an opportunity to out wit us both suppose we form a coalition and agree to manage jointly there will be enough for both at least our profits will be better than none at all as we have now  will assented and the coalition was formed  the consequence was that by the influence of their numerous followers they soon regained the management but as james was still the old man and some of their mutual measures were suggested and followed out by him and especially as solomon cacataba who was a mountebank of the first order had been very profuse of cozening liquor the tenants were discontented  this encouraged hector truboy a follower and disciple of solomon cacataba but in faith a clever and good lad to apply to the discontented tenants for a deputation to be sent to the lord recommending him hector truboy as the properest person to manage the estate seeing that solomon was rather disliked on account of his jesuitic principles and james and will were supposed to be little better than old rogues the tenants agreed and further represented that much was to be hoped from the youth of hector truboy as not enured or experienced in vice  the lord graciously assented and hector truboy became manager but the tenants were much disappointed for his advisers were chiefly the old friends of james tory and his measures were of course mostly tyrannical and capricious he was however rather fortunate and good fortune in a general or a minister is equivalent to great ability                          quaedam desiderantur                chapter xix a digression on coalitions when you mix strong and weak sweet and four you form a coalition commonly called punch a pleasant liquor but not wholesome  when you mix vegetable and animal and oil and vinegar you form a coalition commonly called a sallad which is both pleasant and wholesome  in like manner political coalitions may prove either good or bad for the health of the state  coalitions in religion are wished for by all honest men who look upon true religion as incompatiable with a spirit of controversy and enmity but to the great consolation of the enemies of religion the sects are still destroying each other and infidelity triumphs in the civil war mindful of the remark of tacitus dum singuli pugnant universi vincuntur go on my friends says the laughing infidel fight about high church and low church till neither church exists fight about your tithes till none are paid fight about your surplices till they are torn from your backs fight about bishop and presbyter till both are annihilated fight i say and fight bravely  political coalitions have always been common not a party madam ever existed since the world began but was in same degree formed by coalition opinions vary like faces every man has his own the party has only a single leading opinion which unites them in other respects they are a coalition  but some coalitions shock by their excessive violence were you to present at your table madam a plate of salmogundy mixed with strawberries every guest would stare  no one is shocked at a coalition between a watchman and a housebreaker between a pickpocket and a trading justice between a prime minister and a jesuit between a chief lord of the treasury and a commissary between  stop sacrifice to harpocrates the god of silence warburton   no madam these are all matters of course  but a coalition between a catholic bishop and a calvinistic presbyter between a lord chancellor of england and a burgomaster of amsterdam between the devil and an exorcist between the king and john wilkes between the duke of richmond and cohorn the engineer between charles fox and the queen of france between a cat and a rat between a man and his wife would be truly surprising  a wonder madam lasts only for nine days  chapter xx the birth and education of jack commongood about this time jack commongood began to make a stir upon the estate  jack was the son of parents in a moderate situation of life neither poor nor rich but what they had was independent he was from his infancy a remarkable shy boy fond of retirement and of doing good unseen he seemed always lost in thought and with all will whigs frankness and goodness of heart he had more solidity and sedateness money he put no value upon except to give away in charity  having lost his father and mother very early in life he was trained up by a cruel uncle a relation of will whigs jack profited as all do in the school of adversity and with all the abilities of will whig had a humility the most profound when jack began to promise great things james tory pretended that he was his relation but this jack always denied and indeed he had not a particle of james torys cunning or tyranny  all jacks studies centered in the doing of good to his fellow creatures he was well versed in classical learning but he said that he would prefer one good action to all the learning in the world and he proved that he did not speak in vain  he would often assert that mankind were complete masters of every art except the only one which they ought to prefer to all the art of bettering themselves and the society they live in  the italian proverb that opinion is the queen of the world pleased him much and he often wished that the reign of this fantastic queen were at an end and reason enthroned king in her place  a conqueror he always termed a butcher and affected great contempt for war except in selfdefence or in defense of freedom with the french moralist he laughed at the madness of mankind who esteem a sword which destroys men a badge of honor and decoration while the instrument which creates men is an object of shame  he would say that the happiness of mankind depended solely upon the rectitude of their opinions and while their opinions were false they would ever be miserable can that country be wise or happy where a soldier is a title of honor and a mechanic a term of contempt nobility should attend utility i know no real nobles except the mechanic and the farmer but mankind will always honor shadows and neglect the substance those nations who adore the sun have some excuse but how numerous are they who worship wooden idols of their own making and are struck with awe at the finery with which they themselves have dressed them  in such paradoxes did jack indulge they at first attracted notice merely by their novelty but the more they were examined the more solid they were found the tenants began to be much pleased with jack and to say that to this vigor of youth he added more than the wisdom of age  chapter xxi the speech of jack to james and will when jack commongood came to mans estate he began to attend the meetings of the tenants where he was distinguished by his intrepidity and the novelty and force of his reasoning  at one of these meetings which james tory and will whig regularly attended they jointly proposed an important scheme in outward appearance for the good of the estate but which in reality would only have terminated in lodging a good sum o money in their pockets jack saw through this immediately and rising up addressed them in these terms  gentlemen i honor you both equally you james tory have done harm to the estate and you will whig have done it little good even when detached from each other your administrations resembled each other so nearly that all the tenants saw that a change of men was not a change of measures to load the tenants with taxes and corrupt them with bribery were the leading objects of both do you really suppose gentlemen that the tenants will be your dupes for ever do you not know that they see through your schemes if you must deceive us do not at least insult our understandings what is your private interest what are your parties to the good of the estate drop them in the name of common honesty and if you formed an union for the sake of ambition and interest as your enemies say do form another for the good of the estate and the tenants wipe away by present merit the memory of past offenses let the knowledge of the contempt into which you are fallen act as a spur to incite you to redeem yourselves from it by actions of real worth and public benefit such as envy herself cannot distort from their just beauty  james and will who had not been accustomed to such free remonstrances gasped like dying cods and slunk away in confusion  chapter xxii jacks visit to frankland james and will were at first quite angry with jack and by means of their adherents gave him so many mortifications that jack thought proper to retire to frankland a neighboring estate  here jack was surprised with a very odd scene for frankland which had been long oppressed by bad management had all of a sudden become one of the freest estates in the country  this was owing entirely to the spirit of the tenants which long oppression had roused into a flame they had seized upon the management themselves and made a new code of rules to determine all questions by concerning the management the public good was to be the only law tithes were abolished and the imprudent power and claims of the richer annihilated they would allow of no nobility but that of merit and all men were to be equal as god made them  some heads had been broken upon the occasion but what is the death of a few men to the good of thousands and the descendants of three thousands never had such a revolution been accomplished with as little bloodshed jack justly observed that it was seldom the public good could be accomplished without broken heads that a little bloodshed makes a great noise whereas the death of successive millions from want and misery occasioned by tyrannic government is not attended to so great is the power of that mad lady opinion  jack was glad to find some of his own schemes realized and still happier to reflect that to set his fellowtenants to rights there was no occasion for such extremities let us said he put an effectual stop to bribery resorm our old laws agree what tenants are to be invited to the meetings insist upon the tenants being mentioned first in all solemn deeds instead of the manager and some other matters and we shall do verywell  chapter xxiii how jack commongood was made manager of the estate james and will finding that they could not regain the confidence of the tenants and observing that jack was very popular among them generously agreed to serve their wishes by inviting him back and lending him all their influence to procure the management and hector truboy as generously resigned his place in favor of jack  jack could hardly believe his good fortune but as soon as he was installed he insisted upon will whigs dropping all connection with james tory whom jack could not abide will cheerfully exchanged the friendship of james for that of jack for wills connection with james had been what shakespeare calls a halffaced fellowship  when jack had accomplished this purpose he took will into all his councils and as they agreed in most points and had much the same train of thinking their friendship became most firm wills experience assisted the genius of jack and jacks honesty checked the selfinterest of will  james was detested by both but permitted not only to remain upon the estate but always to speak his mind freely at every meeting for jack said an opposition
