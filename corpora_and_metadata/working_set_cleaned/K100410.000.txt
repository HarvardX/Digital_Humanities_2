verses humbly addressed to sir thomas hanmer on his edition of shakespeares works  by a gentleman of oxford  london printed for m cooper in paternoster row      price six pence  to sir thomas hanmer sir while owned by you with smiles the muse surveys the expected triumph of her sweetest lays while stretched at ease she boasts your guardian aid secure and happy in her sylvan shade excuse her fears who scarce a verse bestows in just remembrance of the debt she owes with conscious awe she hears the critics fame and blushing hides her wreath at shakespeares name long slighted fancy with a mothers care wept over his works and felt the last despair torn from her head she saw the roses fall by all deserted though admired by all  and oh she cried shall science still resign  whatever is natures and whatever is mine  shall taste and art but show a cold regard  and scornful pride reject the unlettered bard  ye myrtled nymphs who own my gentle reign  tune the sweet lyre and grace my airy train  if where ye rove your searching eyes have known  one perfect mind which judgment calls its own  there every breast its fondest hopes must bond  and every muse with tears await her friend twas then fair isis from her stream arose in kind compassion of her sisters woes twas then she promised to the mourning maid the immortal honors which thy hands have paid  my bestlovd son she said shall yet restore  thy ruined sweets and fancy weep no more each rising art by slow gradation moves toil builds on toil and age on age improves the muse alone unequal dealt her rage and graced with noblest pomp her earliest stage preserved through time the speaking scenes impart each changeful wish of phaedras tortured heart or paint the curse that marked the the oedipus of sophocles thebans reign a bed incestuous and a father slain line after line our pitying eyes overflow trace the sad tale and own anothers woe to rome removed with equal power to please the comic sisters kept their native ease with jealous fear declining greece beheld her own menanders art almost excelled but every muse essayed to raise in vain some labored rival of her tragic strain ilissus laurels though transferred with toil drooped their fair leaves nor knew the unfriendly soil when rome herself her envied glories dead no more imperial stooped her conquered head luxuriant florence chose a softer theme while all was peace by arnos silver stream with sweeter notes the etrurian vales complained and arts reviving told  a cosmo reigned their wanton lyres the bards of provence strung sweet flowed the lays but love was all they sung the gay description could not fail to move for led by nature all are friends to love but heaven still rising in its works decreed the perfect boast of time should last succeed the beauteous union must appear at length of tuscan fancy and athenian strength one greater muse elizas reign adorn and even a shakespeare to her fame be born yet ah so bright her mornings opening ray in vain our britain hoped an equal day no second growth the western isle could bear at once exhausted with too rich a year too nicely johnson knew the critics part nature in him was almost lost in art of softer mold the gentle fletcher came the next in order as the next in name with pleased attention midst his scenes we find each glowing thought that warms the female mind each melting sigh and every tender tear the lovers wishes and the virgins fear his their characters are thus distinguished by mr dryden every strain the loves and graces own but stronger shakespeare felt for man alone drawn by his pen our ruder passions stand the unrivaled picture of his early hand with gradual steps and slow exacter france saw arts fair empire over her shores advance by length of toil a bright perfection knew correctly bold and just in all she drew till late corneille from epick the favorite author of the elder corneille lucan brought the full expression and the roman thought and classic judgment gained to sweet racine the temperate strength of maros chaster line but wilder far the british laurel spread and wreaths less artful crown our poets head yet he alone to every scene could give the historians truth and bid the manners live waked at his call i view with glad surprise majestic forms of mighty monarchs rise there henrys trumpets spread their loud alarms and laureled conquest waits her heros arms here gentler edward claims a pitying sigh scarce born to honors and so soon to die yet shall thy throne unhappy infant bring no beam of comfort to the guilty king the tempus erit turno magno cum optaverit emptum intactum pallanta etc time shall come when glosters heart shall bleed in lifes last hours with horror of the deed when dreary visions shall at last present thy vengeful image in the midnight tent thy hand unseen the secret death shall bear blunt the weak sword and break the oppressive spear wherever we turn by fancy charmed we find some sweet illusion of the cheated mind often wild of wing she calls the soul to rove with humbler nature in the rural grove where swains contented own the quiet scene and twilight fairies tread the circled green dressed by her hand the woods and valleys smile and spring diffusive decks the enchanted isle o blessed in all that genius gives to charm whose morals mend us and whose passions warm often let my youth attend thy various page where rich invention rules the unbounded stage there every scene the poets warmth may raise and melting music find the softest lays o might the muse with equal ease persuade expressive picture to adopt thine aid some powerful raphael should again appear and arts consenting fix their empire here methinks even now i view some fair design where breathing nature lives in every line chaste and subdued the modest colors lie in fair proportion to the approving eye  and see where see the tragedy of julius caesar antony lamenting stands in fixed distress and spreads his pleading hands over the pale corse the warrior seems to bend deep sunk in grief and mourns his murdered friend still as they press he calls on all around lifts the torn robe and points the bleeding wound but coriolanus see mr spences dialogues on the odyssey who is he whose brows exalted bear a rage impatient and a fiercer air even now his thoughts with eager vengeance doom the last sad ruin of ungrateful rome till slowadvancing over the tented plain in sable weeds appear the kindredtrain the frantic mother leads their wild despair beats her swollen breast and rends her silver hair and see he yields  the tears unbidden start and conscious nature claims the unwilling heart over all the man conflicting passions rise rage grasps the sword while pity melts the eyes thus generous critic as thy bard inspires the sister arts shall nurse their drooping fires each from his scenes her stores alternate bring spread the fair tints or wake the vocal string those sibylleaves the sport of every wind for poets ever were a careless kind by thee disposed no farther toil demand but just to nature own thy forming hand so spread over greece the harmonious whole unknown even homers numbers charmed by parts alone their own ulysses scarce had wandered more by winds and waters cast on every shore when raised by fate some former hanmer joined each beauteous image of the tuneful mind and bad like thee his athens ever claim a fond alliance with the poets name oxford dec        finis
