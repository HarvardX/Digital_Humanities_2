the memoirs of the countess of berci  taken from the french by the author of the female quixote  in two volumes  vol i  london printed for a millar in the strand m dcc lvi  the history of the chevalier des essars and the countess of berci part i in the reign of one of the greatest princes the french monarchy ever had lived a young nobleman equally illustrious for his virtues and the grandeur of his descent the count of berci is the name i shall give him here his person was genteel and elegant his manners soft and insinuating he was in high esteem for his valor and his fidelity to his master during those troubles which disturbed the first years of the reign of henry iv acquired him the esteem of that great king who knew how to distinguish and loved to reward merit  with such advantages of nature and fortune it will be easily imagined the count of berci could not be unsuccessful in a wellplaced passion nor indeed was he suffered to sigh long for the daughter of the marquis de saintsauveur whom he demanded in marriage the marquis approved of his addresses and the young lady gave him her hand without reluctance  the count and countess of berci passed the first years of their marriage in the chaste pleasures of a tender union the count neglected no opportunity to procure for his wife all those amusements which it is natural for persons of her sex and years to be fond of and the countess on her side made it her chief care to merit his esteem by an exact and prudent conduct and preserve his love by her softness and attention to please hymen lavished on this amiable pair his choicest favors their love always tender and sincere was always uniform and constant neither embittered with jealousy nor palled by any of those disgusts which too often follow the possession of what we have most ardently desired  but this happiness was not to last for ever the chevalier des essars happened to see the countess of berci one evening at the play to see her and to love her with the most ardent passion was the same thing the chevaliers birth was noble his face though beautiful to excess was without effeminacy his person though eminently genteel was bold and manly to the frank and easy manners of a soldier he joined the polished elegance of a court his early valor had made him remarkable in europe and the following pages of this history will furnish such amazing proofs of his courage as would transcend belief if the histories of past ages had not given credibility to the exploits of those heroes who filled the world with their glory and their virtues  the chevalier des essars was then in his thirtieth year and the countess of berci just turned of eighteen her stature was tall her shape easy and delicate her complexion fine and animated her eyes were large black and full of fire all the features of her face were regular and charming a thousand nameless graces were diffused over her whole form and captivated the heart of every beholder yet this person lovely as it was was her least perfection she had a fine understanding cultivated by reading and reflection a wit lively and pleasing a noble and generous mind and a sweetness in her manners that secured all those hearts which the charms of her person had first surprised but truly admirable as all these qualities were it was that unclouded reason that solid virtue that noble fortitude and that blameless conduct which she constantly maintained even in her greatest misfortunes and the most dangerous circumstances of her life that crowned and gave a luster to them all she was early taught that beauty when not accompanied by virtue and the brighter graces of the mind could never hope for the esteem of wise and good men whose eyes it only pleased but could not extend its influence to the heart and that the greatest personal advantages if not strengthened by virtue were the most fatal gifts that nature could dispense  the countess of berci felt all the force of these maxims she received and lodged them in her heart and regulated by them the whole conduct of her life and if she at length felt some sensibility for the passion of the chevalier des essars she restrained it within such strict bounds that it never endangered her virtue and by her prudent conduct she changed the most impetuous man in the world into the most respectful and submissive lover that ever was  but it is now time to return to the chevalier des essars at the first sight of the countess of berci her charms made a deep impression upon his heart he was so wholly engrossed by them that he was indifferent to all things else nor could he give a moments attention to any other object when the play was ended he eagerly enquired the name of that enchanting fair one and was overjoyed to find he might love her without blushing he returned home full of pleasing anxiety a new and sweet disorder possessed him how altered in a few hours he was no more that fiery warrior whose soul till then had been accessible to no other passion but glory the image of the countess of berci took full possession of his breast and the conquest of her heart was the only ambition he was now sensible of oh powerful love how in a moment do thou fix thy empire in our souls and suspend or destroy every other passion  the chevalier des essars would have rejoiced to find that the object of his passion had been single and at liberty to receive his vows her being married was a circumstance which gave him great grief and perplexity he even made some efforts to vanquish his newborn love company dissipation and the remonstrances of his friends might perhaps have rendered those efforts effectual but he on the contrary delivered himself up to solitude and conversing only with his own thoughts his reason became subjected to his love he flattered himself that he might love without a crime his disordered imagination suggested a thousand vain chimeras and leaving it to time and fortune to make him happy he abandoned himself entirely to the violence of his passion although he had never seen the countess of berci till that fatal evening at the play yet he had some slight acquaintance with the count and he conceived that the best way to get an introduction to the wife was to commence a strict friendship with the husband and here his success was answerable to his wishes the count of berci thought it an honor to be ranked among the particular friends of the chevalier des essars and met his advances with such eagerness that in a short time they became inseparable  the count of berci was continually talking to his wife of the great merit of the chevalier he made one in all their parties of pleasure the countess to please her lord took all opportunities of showing the respect and esteem she had for him and the chevalier at first only discovered a profound veneration for the countess but his passion gaining daily new force by the frequent opportunities he had of seeing the lovely object of it it was with the utmost difficulty he concealed the secret of his heart and weary of the intolerable restraint he resolved to seize the first favorable moment to reveal his love without giving the count any suspicion and this design employed all his thoughts  in effect it was very difficult to execute but what will not a lover attempt who lives in the most terrible uncertainty of his fate the chevalier to prevent giving the count any suspicions had at first regulated all his actions his words and even his looks with so much prudence that nothing escaped him in his presence which could discover his real sentiments he was neither too free nor too reserved and kept so just a mean that his behavior had not the least appearance of artifice or affectation the count and chevalier were always together and every day was distinguished with some new amusement assemblies tournaments running at the ring each had a place in this circle of pleasures the two friends were always the challengers in every tournament and never failed to give the most shining proofs of their valor and dexterity  in former times the french nobility were passionately fond of all those diversions which at first were instituted in honor of the ladies the prizes which the victors always received from their hands was a spur to their emulation and early incited them to form themselves for all those exercises which it became every nobleman to be skilful in but tournaments which are natural representations of battles however proper they might be to instruct the young nobility in the military art were notwithstanding abolished in france as being thought too dangerous no one can be ignorant of the fatal accident that happened to henry the second one of our kings who died of a wound he received in a tournament in the forty first year of his age and the thirteenth of his reign tournaments and running at the ring were still in use in the times i am speaking of and they were the most splendid and most noble amusements in the court of our kings i hope the reader will pardon this short digression the succeeding part of this history will show the necessity of it but let us now return to our noble friends  the count of berci had a taste for magnificence and pleasure the chevalier was always with him either at his house or at some public diversion after which till the hour of supper arrived they amused themselves with walking in some of those enchanting gardens which constitute one of the chief pleasures of paris the charming countess made one in all their parties the chevalier would have thought them insipid without her presence but still no opportunity offered to speak to her in private in vain he endeavored to conceal his torments the soft languor that appeared in his eyes when he met those of the countess gave her some suspicion of his passion but the unfortunate lover gained no advantage from those suspicions at length the fatal flame that preyed upon his heart began to affect his health he grew pale and wan a fixed melancholy appeared in his countenance and behavior  the count of berci was greatly affected with the situation in which he saw his friend what ails you my dear chevalier said he to him one day when they were walking together some secret grief lies heavy upon your heart is your favor at court declining or does some one of the beauties that adorn it hold you in her chains and by her rigor occasion this strange alteration in you speak my dear chevalier open your heart freely to me and be assured that my fidelity in keeping your secret will not be less than my concern for your misfortunes  the chevalier was a little disconcerted by this discourse of his friend my dear count said he endeavoring to suppress a sigh which nevertheless would force its way how obliging is this tender anxiety of yours believe me there are few evils in life that would give me much affliction with such a friend to alleviate them but indeed i have no reason to complain of my bad fortune the king is still pleased to continue his favor toward me and my heart hitherto insensible to the charms of love has escaped the chains of any of our beauties whom i have beheld with an indifference that preserved my freedom ambition is the sole passion of my soul and the desire of acquiring glory takes up all my thoughts ever since our invincible monarch has been in peaceable possession of the throne of his ancestors the french nobility have languished in a shameful inactivity i can no longer bear to lead this inglorious life and am determined to seek for laurels in other countries which i will water with the blood of our enemies the desire of glory my friend is the passion that consumes me hence proceeds that discontent you have observed in me and that languor your tenderness has likewise taken notice of is caused by a slight indisposition with which i have been troubled for some days past  i am willing to believe you chevalier replied the count but if there is any foundation for the report that now prevails of a rupture between the king and the emperor you will not need to go far to seek occasions of acquiring glory and of signalising your valor as for the indisposition you complain of i am persuaded the air of the country will contribute greatly to remove it it is now the most agreeable season of the year the countess and myself intend to set out in a few days for my estate of beauplan it is but a few leagues distant from fontainebleau where the king is at present we will go from time to time to pay our respects to his majesty and we will endeavor to make your stay at beauplan so agreeable that you shall be quite freed from your melancholy come you must go with us i desire it as a favor and be assured you cannot give the countess a more sensible pleasure she esteems you greatly and the alteration she has observed in your health gives her no less uneasiness than it has done me  the chevalier eagerly accepted a proposal so conformable to his wishes the counts last words gave him a sweet emotion that might have been easily discovered in his countenance had not the arrival of the rest of the company who joined them that instant concealed it from his observation the conversation now became general and during the rest of the time that they continued walking they spoke of nothing but the pleasures and amusements the country would afford them  in the mean time the chevalier who never since the commencement of his fatal passion had had room to entertain the least sentiment of joy resigned himself up to the pleasing hopes with which the new proposal of his friend inspired him he flattered himself that while he continued in the house of his beloved countess he could not sail of meeting with frequent opportunities of entertaining her alone in one of which he might assume courage enough to declare his passion at least he hoped that the calm pleasures of the retirement he was going to would alleviate his cares full of these soothing ideas he set out for beauplan but he soon found that groves and meads thick woods and winding alleys with the soft music of birds and murmuring streams were powerful aids to love and while they soothed increased his flame he had likewise vainly hoped that in the  should find his mistress less engaged  to form their arrival at the castle of beauplan all the neighboring gentry came to pay their respects to the count and his lady and for fifteen days there was such a constant succession of visitors at the castle that the chevalier never found the countess alone one moment during that whole time  the unfortunate chevalier was now in a worse situation than he had ever been the amusements of the country had no charms for him all company was irksome he sought solitude and silence and there without restraint abandoned himself to the gloomy reflections which filled his soul these frequent absences giving the count great uneasiness he used to go in search of him and always found him either in the wildest part of the forest or in some romantic cave swallowed up in deep reflection with his eyes fixed on one particular object which nevertheless he seemed not to regard his mind being wholly employed upon what passed within it the count was now convinced that his friend had disguised the true situation of his heart and that the noise and tumult of paris were more likely to cure his disorder than the privacy of the country  the count who neglected nothing which he thought could dissipate his melancholy obliged him one day to make one in a party for the chase they were to hunt the stag the countes  at home with a brother of  a youth about twenty years o  madam de berci as soon as she had dined desired her brother to walk out with her to meet the hunters in their return they had already entered a wood whose dark embowering shades for ever excluded the sun and made it look like the eternal abode of solitude and silence she sat down at the root of a tree to rest herself a moment when her attention was immediately engaged by the voice of a person whom although she did not see she knew to be but at a small distance from her she rose up instantly and with her brotherinlaw walked softly toward the place from whence this voice seemed to come and being now very near she heard distinctly these words  unhappy wretch what is it thou hopest for why do thou waste the miserable remains of thy life in this wild solitude art thou resolved to die thus obscurely and not have the melancholy pleasure of letting her for whom thou die know the sacrifice thou make her ah too lovely countess added he after a moments pause is it possible that my eyes have not discovered to you the flame you have kindled in my heart sure if you knew the torments i suffer your compassion at least would meet the wretch you have undone no no i deceive myself your haughty virtue would suggest to you that i ought to die unpitied and unlamented wretch that i am dare i avow such sentiments is it for me to form such audacious hopes is it for me to make such unjust complaints ought i not rather to blush at my own baseness i who seek to violate the sacred rights of hospitality and break through all the tender ties of friendship yet alas mine is an involuntary crime i love and who can resist the force of that imperious passion  he rested for some moments on this thought which seemed to calm his sorrow as it palliated his crime and lessened his own remorse but again with new sighs he continued his mournful soliloquy in this manner it is true o adorable countess that when i first beheld you i was no longer master of my heart you triumphed over it in spite of myself and i am sensible your power will not cease but with my life but oh how long will this miserable life endure unless i assume courage enough to reveal my passion ah you will doubtless punish me for my temerity yet i am resolved to disclose my fatal secret and before your eyes will pierce this unhappy breast if i am not able to move some pity in yours  the countess of berci unwilling to hear more left the forest with precipitation it was not difficult for her to discover that she herself was the subject of those complaints she had just heard and that it was the chevalier des essars who had uttered them that unhappy lover who had with much difficulty been persuaded to hunt that day took the first opportunity that offered to withdraw and was returning to the castle with a resolution to discover his passion to the countess but the natural timidity of a lover restraining him instead of entering he took a path that carried him from the castle and following it found himself insensibly at the entrance of this wood its gloominess pleased him he alighted from his horse and tying it to a tree wandered about on foot a long time till being tired he threw himself down under the shade of a large tree and there gave free course to his complaints not imagining that he should be overheard in a place which seemed to him to be only a sit recess for wretches like himself  it is not easy to determine which was most surprised the countess or her brotherinlaw this young lord had till then been absolutely ignorant of the chevaliers passion for his sister and if some slight suspicions of it had forced their way into the mind of the countess her virtue never suffered her thoughts to rest a moment upon them although her innocence was fully proved by the complaints her lover had uttered yet she was under great uneasiness at what had happened young innocent and unexperienced she knew not what conduct to observe on so critical an occasion she could not determine whether it was most eligible to recommend secresy to her brotherinlaw or to desire him to reveal to her husband what he had heard whether she ought to conceal an affair of such consequence from the count or tell him herself what he might possibly learn one day from his brother after some moments reflection she believed the danger equally great whether she was silent or disclosed the secret and therefore took a resolution upon the spot not only to say nothing to her husband but also to dissemble her knowledge of it even to her brotherinlaw accordingly she pursued her way to the castle in a profound silence and seemed to have understood nothing of what she had heard  but she could not impose upon the young berci he easily penetrated into her thoughts and knew how to account for her perplexity he did not love the chevalier des essars the great friendship his brother expressed for him excited his jealousy and he secretly congratulated himself at first that fortune had furnished him with a favorable opportunity to ruin him for ever with his brother but these were the first motions of his mind his natural generosity prevailed over his passions and he rejected with shame the base thoughts which had involuntarily obtruded themselves upon him  he was apprehensive likewise that if his brother should be made acquainted with the sentiments which the chevalier des essars had avowed it might raise suspicions injurious to the honor of his wife and change that tender love he had hitherto felt for her and that confidence he had reposed in her fidelity into indifference and distrust the young chevalier de berci had a great esteem for his sisterinlaw he trembled at the thoughts of kindling the flame of discord between her and her husband and he loved his brother too tenderly to inspire him with a passion so cruel and tormenting as jealousy all these considerations determined him to be silent with respect to what had happened but observing that the countess continued silent and pensive he spoke to her thus i am no longer surprised madam at the terrible melancholy in which the chevalier des essars is plunged he is in love and you are the object of his passion and i must needs confess that the extreme indifference you discover for this unhappy man astonishes me  methinks replied the countess with some emotion you are not less indiscreet than the person you speak of if it be true that i am the object of his passion as you tell me it is no less true that the conquest far from flattering my vanity gives me on the contrary great uneasiness but that we may no longer have occasion to talk of the chevalier des essars and his presumptuous designs for which i am truly afflicted i conjure you by our mutual friendship to assist me in finding out the means of procuring his departure from beauplan there is nothing i wish with more ardour than to be freed from his presence that i may receive no farther proof of that extravagance you attribute to him my virtue is alarmed by the bare possibility that i may be suspected of giving the least encouragement to his unhappy passion and my honor is sensibly wounded by being the involuntaly object of it  i am very much concerned madam replied the young berci that i cannot do you the service you require of me if i undertake to remove the chevalier des essars from beauplan he may possibly complain of my proceedings to my brother who will doubtless insist upon knowing my reasons for thus treating a man who is so dear to him how then shall i avoid disclosing a secret which for many reasons it is not fit he should be acquainted with however if you shall judge it proper to write a letter to the chevalier such as your own prudence shall dictate to you i will very willingly take upon myself the care of getting it safely delivered to him and i am persuaded that honoring you so much as he does and seeing that his passion is both discovered and contemned he will take a resolution to banish himself voluntarily from your presence rather than interrupt your quiet and the happiness of your family  this expedient was approved by the countess and she resolved to put it in execution that very night they arrived at the castle without meeting any one but the hunters were not long after them they entered with joyful acclamations having taken in that days sport a monstrous stag the chevalier des essars was the last that returned home they did not fail to railly him upon his leaving them he got off by saying that he had lost his way and had not been able to rejoin the company little did he then imagine that the complaints he had uttered in the forest at beauplan had reached the ears of his mistress and that she was forming such cruel resolutions against him  the countess of berci whose mind was in great agitation retired to her apartment sooner than usual and giving orders to her attendants that no one should interrupt her she shut herself up in her closet and abandoned herself to her reflections the adventure of the forest so dangerous to her reputation so injurious to her virtue filled her with inquietude she dreaded the fatal consequences that might result from it she reproached her own innocent self for being the object of so criminal a pursuit and detested those charms which had been capable of inspiring wishes and of suggesting hopes destructive to her fame a torrent of tears ran from her fine eyes and wet that beautiful breast which was afflicting itself for the crimes of others not her own  at length she became a little more composed and began to write after many times altering effacing and writing anew she at length finished a letter and sending for her brotherinlaw she delivered it to him entreating him to dispose it in such a manner that the chevalier des essars might find it that night in his chamber without his being able to guess how it came there she recommended it to him in a particular manner that in copying this anonimous letter he should carefully disguise his hand for she apprehended some dangerous consequences might ensue if the chevalier discovered that it was the young berci who had written the letter  every thing was done with as much expedition and secresy as she could have wished supper being served the countess left her chamber and seated herself at table the whole company except the chevalier and the countess was cheerful and supped with a good appetite however they assumed as much gaiety as possible and both carefully dissembled the uneasy thoughts which agitated their souls the countess tasted by anticipation the good effects her letter was likely to produce and the chevalier ignorant of the new torments that fortune was preparing for him regretted his not having made use of the favorable opportunity which the counts absence had afforded him to declare his passion and was resolved not to defer opening his whole heart to the countess any longer than the next day if he should be so happy to find her alone  as soon as the company broke up the count as usual attended the chevalier to his apartment where after discoursing with him some time upon indifferent matters he retired and left him with his servants whom the chevalier dismissing when he was undrest approached his bed and then found the fatal letter which was conceived in these words fly from this hospitable house which thou have violated with thy impure designs fly rash and presumptuous man heaven has permitted thy impious thoughts to be disclosed which thou had vainly imagined were hid in the inmost recesses of thy heart and out of the depth of a vast forest amidst the shades of an eternal night has brought thy crime into open day unworthy as thou art of the name of a gentleman thou have plotted the dishonor of the count of berci thy friend and not satisfied with having formed designs against the innocence of his wife thou have the audacity to resolve upon confessing thy passion to her a passion as odious as it is criminal thy death had been already the punishment for thy crime if thy injured friend and his wife both equally outraged had been made acquainted with thy purpose but if heaven has permitted that they should be still ignorant of it it is because thou should have time to reflect upon the horror of thy enterprise fly then instantly from a place where if thou should happen to be discovered nothing could preserve thee from the fury of their just revenge  what a cruel stroke was this to a tender lover to have all his hopes blasted in a moment and deprived for ever of the sight of her who was dearer to him than life pale trembling and overwhelmed with the deepest despair he remained for a long time motionless with his eyes fixed on the fatal letter which he still held in his hand he could not comprehend by whom it had been written with such an appearance of mystery but he knew that he was discovered and that the complaints he had made that day in the forest had been overheard oppressed with grief he threw himself upon his bed but sleep was a stranger to his eyes in vain he endeavored to guess the author of this cruel letter the count of berci he knew had not quitted the chase and it was not probable that that nobleman would on an occasion wherein his honor was so deeply concerned have contented himself with writing in such a manner neither was it likely that the countess was the author of it he was entirely ignorant of her having been in the forest and besides the letter declared that she as well as her husband had no suspicion of his love and his schemes it was probable therefore that this anonymous letter had been written by the count of bercis brother who had not been of the party for hunting the chevalier had on many occasions perceived that this young lord was not his friend but he could not persuade himself that a youth like him stimulated by hatred would have been capable of acting with so much prudence and moderation in an affair which furnished him with an opportunity of ruining him with the count his brother  the more he reflected upon this letter the greater uncertainty he found himself in and the more his trouble increased but miserable as he knew he should be when deprived of the sight of his dear countess yet he resolved to quit the castle of beauplan immediately he was convinced that since his passion was discovered by some one in the family he could not stay longer without exposing the honor of madam de berci to suspicion and that the perpetual restraint he should be obliged to lay upon himself would subject him to new torments his thoughts now were wholly employed upon the means of departing without giving umbrage to the count and how to procure a moments conversation with the countess the hope of which was the only consolation he had in the miserable condition to which he was reduced  as soon as day appeared he went himself and wakened one of his footmen ordering him to prepare to set out for fontainebleau with the utmost expedition he then wrote a letter to one of his most intimate friends at court entreating him to send him an answer after the model he prescribed to him he then directed his footman to give this letter into his friends own hands and to bring him his answer with the utmost dispatch the servant returned early the next morning from fontainbleau with the requested letter in which the chevaliers friend informed him that it was necessary he should come to court as soon as possible for reasons of great importance which he could not confide to any one but himself  in the mean time the chevalier wasted all his moments in contriving expedients to procure an interview with the countess but none of them succeeded she avoided him so carefully and with such apparent design that he was convinced she not only had discovered his passion but was likewise the author of that letter which had so greatly alarmed him finding all his endeavors to speak to the countess ineffectual he went to the counts apartment where as his good fortune would have it he also found the countess his wife he showed monsieur de berci the letter he had received from his friend and entreated him not to be offended that for some time he should be obliged to deprive himself of the pleasure of his society the count who tenderly loved the chevalier des essars was greatly afflicted at this news you cannot sure said he be so much hurried as to hinder you from giving us at least the remainder of this day to prepare for the grief we shall suffer by losing you besides i have myself received some news from court which i want to communicate to you and to have your advice upon saying this the count quitted the room immediately without waiting for the chevaliers answer for the express that had brought him letters from paris attended his orders and by thus leaving him alone with his wife he himself contributed to satisfy the wishes of this too tender and unfortunate lover  the countess seeing her husband leave the room was preparing to follow him excusing herself to the chevalier on account of some necessary orders she had to give but the chevalier well knowing the value of an opportunity which he might probably never meet with again stopped her with a respectful air and beholding her with eyes in which the disorder of his soul was but too visible ah do not fly madam said he with a trembling voice grant me one moments audience i have just acquainted the count with the news that has been brought me from court but i have received others also from a person who is extremely dear to me i conjure you madam do not refuse me the favor of reading this letter it will not detain you long saying these words he presented her with the billet which he suspected she had wrote to him and fixing his eyes at the same time attentively upon her face the countess who in an instant perceived the snare he had laid for her could not constrain herself so far as to conceal her just indignation from the chevalier what advantage do you expect from your artifice monsieur said she what have you dared to hope from this temerity can you imagine that i will suffer you to remain at beauplan after the offense you have been guilty of be satisfied with my moderation in not revealing your injurious designs to my lord and take care that by another attempt which may possibly come to his knowledge my honor may not be wounded by the sacrifice of your life to his resentment ah madam replied the chevalier throwing himself at her feet how unjust how rigorous are you i love the count of berci your husband with the sincerest affection and i adore you with such purity of sentiments such inviolable respect that i cannot think either of you ought to be offended at my passion it is indeed true madam that what i concealed from you through fear of your resentment i freely uttered to the trees amidst the gloominess of a forest that seemed sacred to solitude and grief there it was that i indulged my sorrow by complaints which i had not the temerity to wish might come to your ear but since contrary to my intentions you have heard them suffer me to confess madam that if it is a crime to love an amiable object with the most respectful passion i am the most guilty man in the world nay more while i confess so freely this crime if it be one i likewise protest that i can never repent of it ah madam how useless are your threats against my life i would only preserve it for your service and i cannot sacrifice it more nobly than to my love for you but your honor requires that i should deprive myself of the only consolation my unhappy destiny affords me i must live without seeing you that your quiet may not be disturbed nor your reputation injured ah what would not such motives prevail upon me to do yes madam i will leave you i will reduce myself to the most horrible despair rather than give you the slghtest uneasiness bt do not imagine that i will renounce my love alas it is no longer in my power to do so all i can do is to avoid your presence that i may adore you without offending you i go then madam from your sight yes you shall have this fatal proof of my obedience but ah permit me to entreat that softened by such an implicit submission to your inhuman commands you may be one day prevailed upon to recall a miserable wretch who to please you banished himself from the most delightful abode he can ever be in in this world  this speech uttered with those insinuating charms which always accompany the discourse of a lover tender submissive and unhappy made some impression on the breast of the countess but the more she felt herself moved by words so well calculated to seduce her the more she guarded herself against their dangerous softness by reflecting upon what she owed to her own honor and her husbands tenderness for her she turned away her eyes that she might not meet those of the chevalier whose passionate glances died her cheeks with blushes and gave her a confusion she wished him not to be sensible of assuming therefore a calm and serene air she answered him thus  you ought to know my character well monsieur and to believe that my knowledge of your merit would make me think the passion you avow for me an honor were i at liberty to accept of it as i am it is injurious to my virtue and my fame both which ought to be dear to you if you have really any tenderness for me you ought to be satisfied with the esteem your merit has inspired me with since it is all my virtue will allow of and never hope that i shall be capable of entertaining any other sentiments pursue then monsieur the resolution you have taken to leave beauplan which will appear the more necessary when you shall know that young berci was with me in the forest when you indulged those imprudent complaints he will doubtless watch your conduct strictly every thing will appear of consequence to an interested observer he is jealous of the friendship his brother bears you he may do you bad offices with him at least he may disclose your secret young men though generous are not always discrete  the countess had but just ended these words when the count entered the chamber with his brother the chevalier was grieved that their conversation was interrupted and both he and the countess were apprehensive that the young lord had discovered their secret however their suspicions were soon removed the count taking the chevalier aside discovered his own affairs to him with such unlimited confidence that he was persuaded he was entirely ignorant of his whilst they were engaged in this private conference the countess acquainted her brotherinlaw with the success of her billet she told him that the chevalier had resolved to quit beauplan immediately but she took no notice of his having mentioned his love to her or that he knew the billet he had found came from her  the chevalier felt some alleviation of his sorrows by the confession he had made to the countess she had indeed given him no hopes but she had listened to him without anger he appeared less melancholy than usual the rest of that day and passed the night if not in tranquillity yet free from the dreadful inquietude which his doubts about that fatal letter had occasioned the next day after taking a tender leave of the count and countess he set out for the court his mind being wholly employed upon the gentleness and moderation with which madam de berci had listened to the confession he made her of his passion he rode with great swiftness contrary to the general practice of lovers who move slowly and with regret from the place where they have left the object of their tenderness and fortunately as it proved for him he arrived before night at the entrance of the forest of fontainebleau  scarce had he rode a few paces in it when by the report of some pistols that were fired and the cries that reached his ears he judged that some persons were attacked by robbers in that wood and that they were not at any great distance all the attendants he had with him were a valet de chamber and two footmen but had he been alone he had too much courage to have gone back he rode on then with an intrepidity natural to him and directing his course to the place from whence the noise proceeded he saw a single man environed by ten robbers who were upon the point of assassinating him these wretches had already killed two of his attendants and dispersed three others who sought their safety in flight the man that was left defended himself desperately and knowing that he could not escape death he resolved to sell his life dear he had already got rid of two of the robbers with his pistols and supporting himself against the trunk of a large tree he parried with his sword as well as he could the strokes that these villains aimed at him  the chevalier des essars transported with rage at this sight fired his pistols at the robbers and did some execution he afterward rushed in among them being mounted upon a vigorous horse and pierced with his sword all who opposed his passage his pistols laid two of these assassins upon the earth his horse threw down another who fell at his feet and his sword delivered him from a fourth the rest of these wicked wretches seeing the ground covered with their dead and wounded comrades were seized with terror and believing the whole marechasse was at their heels they disappeared in an instant and took shelter in the deepest recesses of the forest leaving the field of battle free to the intrepid chevalier des essars  after this bloody combat he approached the gentleman whom he had relieved and was charmed to see in a person whose white hairs showed that he was full of years all the fire and activity of youth he was struck with a reverential awe at the majesty which appeared in his countenance and saluting him in a most respectful manner enquired if he was wounded and offered him his best services generous unknown replied the old gentleman my wounds i believe are but inconsiderable to your valor and the speedy relief you brought me i owe the preservation of my life but i am very much concerned for the loss of my servants who are all either dead or dispersed as for the former replied the chevalier they have died like men of honor the others who so basely abandoned you are not worthy of your cares nevertheless they are so near the court whither i suppose your journey was to terminate that they cannot be in any danger i was indeed going to court answered the old gentleman but i did not design to continue there any considerable time it is long since my age and the charms of a country life have forced me from that honorable captivity but monsieur let us i conjure you see whether these two faithful servants whom with grief i saw fall in my defense have any occasion for our assistance the chevaliers servants had already alighted and were busy about the two men who they found still breathed although they were dangerously wounded in many places with great difficulty they restored them to their senses and then hollowing to the rest of the old gentlemans servants who had fled their voices favored by the silence of the night resounded through the forest and reached the ears of those terrified men who hearing themselves called by their names began to lose part of their fears and they returned to their master whom they could not behold without confusion after having bound up his wounds they applied themselves to relieve their comrades who were in much greater danger and seating them upon horses they mounted behind and supported them and in this manner pursued the road to fontainebleau  during this journey the chevalier des essars addressed himself to the old gentleman and apologizing for his curiosity entreated him to let him know who it was he had had the good fortune to assist i am too much obliged to your valor monsieur replied the old gentleman not to seize eagerly this occasion of gratifying your wishes i will not only tell you my name and quality but i will give you an account of my adventures the life which you have so lately preserved is a benefit i hold from your generosity and all the moments which for the future i shall enjoy ought to be devoted to you happy if the grateful sense i have of what you have done for me will not be unacceptable but happier still if fortune will be favorable to my most ardent wishes and afford me the means of serving you and of giving you some striking proof of my gratitude the chevalier returned answers full of respect to these obliging expressions and entreated the old gentleman to begin his recital and give him a more perfect knowledge of a person for whom he already felt so much esteem accordingly the old gentleman began thus  i was born in the province of burgundy i am called the marquis de saintsauveur great part of my life has been spent in the field in the service of my country and religion and there have been few memorable actions that have past in my time which i have not been a witness of i was wounded in that fatal battle in which don john of austria and the venetians died the sea of the levant with ottoman blood after having served a long time in foreign countries i returned to france i made my last campaigns in those fatal civil wars where citizens blinded by a false zeal dipped their impious hands in the blood of their fellowcitizens and thought it for the glory of religion to attack the lives of their countrymen with a savage fury deplorable times when the subject thought he was doing an acceptable service insolently to take up arms against his lawful king  i am speaking monsieur of the last rebellions in france against that generous monarch so dear at present to the very people who once so eagerly opposed him a prince whose goodness courage and glory will live eternally in the annals of our history i had the honor to fight near him in the celebrated battle of ivry the event of which was to seat him upon the throne or to exclude him from it for ever his forces were greatly inferior to those of his enemies but henry whose person alone was worth a whole army formed himself the plan of the battle was present in every part animated all and exposed himself like a common soldier to every danger before he ordered the signal to be given for sounding the charge he spoke these few words to his soldiers with that majestic sweetness which gained him every heart friends said he you are french men i am your king and there is the enemy this noble and iaconick speech inspired us with courage and excited a general emulation we gained a complete victory which was followed by many other great advantages the reduction of mante and vernon which were brought under the obedience of their lawful sovereign put him in possession of all the bridges of the seine that lay between paris and rouen  we afterward made ourselves masters of all the towns in the neighborhood of paris the siege of that great capital which was reduced to the last extremity having been raised by the king in compassion to the unhappy parisians and failing in our attempt to get possession of it by stratagem we invested and took chartres in a most rigorous season at length this great prince who had caused himself to be instructed in the principles of the catholic religion became sensible of the errors of his own and performed his abjuration at the abbey of saint dennis with all the formalities in use in such ceremonies from that happy day the party of the league sunk insensibly and our great monarch by this wise and prudent step which was neither influenced by interest nor fear saw himself in the peaceable possession of a throne which was his lawful inheritance and which he held but from god alone  these were the last campaigns in which i served the whole kingdom submitting to henry the great i resolved to make a a visit to my paternal estate love was the cause of my settling there i was weary of the tumultuous life of a soldier the calm pleasures i tasted in the country made me desirous of privacy and retirement and my passion for madam de saintsauveur whom i happened to see at the house of a neighboring gentleman whom i went to visit confirmed me in my resolution to quit the court and to pass the remainder of my life in burgundy my native province i married her in the course of two years she brought me a son and a daughter my son is at present at court and my daughter was married about three years ago to a nobleman called the count of berci who is now at a castle of his half a days journey from hence i quitted my retreat to come and visit my children whom i passionately longed to see and was wholly intent upon the pleasure of embracing my dear son whom i proposed to visit first when at the entrance of this forest i was set upon by a band of robbers and should have doubtless lost my life by their hands but for the seasonable succor you brought me  such monsieur is the history of my life and fortunes which i have given you in a few words but brave unknown added the old marquis de saintsauveur i expect that you will gratify my impatience to know who has so lately exposed his life yet fresh and blooming to save the poor remains of mine  the chevalier des essars was equally surprised and pleased at what he had heard a secret joy took possession of his soul and a hundred times he blessed his good fortune that the forest of fontainebleau had afforded him an opportunity of saving the life of his mistresss father he might have made himself known to the marquis of saintsauveur not only without danger of any disagreeable consequence but also with an increase of satisfaction to the old man who would have been charmed to hear that this preserver was the intimate friend of the count of berci his soninlaw yet through an excess of delicacy which few would have been capable of he chose rather to conceal his name he flattered himself that when the countess should know that the life of her father had been preserved by him and that by concealing his name he gave a convincing proof that he sought not any acknowledgement from her for such a service she would be as much pleased with his discretion and modesty as with his courage  having taken his resolution therefore he answered the old marquis in this manner i am but a private man monsieur and so little known in the world that if i should tell you my name you would know it no better than you do my person i have only the honor to inform you that this day i passed by the castle of beauplan where the count of berci is at present i heard that he was in good health as is likewise the countess your daughter and the high reputation they have among all the neighboring gentry for their many great and amiable virtues makes me think myself happy to have served them in the person of a gentleman of your rank and so deservedly dear to them  the chevaliers precaution was of no use to him his valet de chamber who knew not that his master had any reasons for concealing his name had discovered it before to one of the marquiss attendants but when he found by his masters discourse that he had a design to keep himself unknown he was concerned at what he had done and entreated the servant to whom he had been so communicative not to repeat what he had said in the mean time the marquis and the chevalier continued their journey to fontainebleau during which the marquis had often but in vain urged his preserver to disclose his name and condition  the court was so full that no lodgings could be procured except one apartment which the chevalier obliged the marquis to accommodate himself with and he went to the house of monsieur de morigny his friend this young lord gave him a most obliging reception and the chevalier as soon as they sat down to supper relating the adventures which had happened to the marquis de saintsauveur in the forest of fontainebleau monsieur de morigny asked him if he knew the son of that marquis who was now at court i have never seen him replied the chevalier but i have heard great praises of his courage he is one of the bravest young men in france resumed monsieur de morigny we performed our exercises together at paris we were hardly ever asunder during our travels through italy and till within these few days we have lived in the strictest intimacy and friendship but there is a great coldness between us at present and i believe it will not be long before we shall break altogether with each other  i am sorry for it answered the chevalier but is it impossible to effect a reconciliation between you it will be a very difficult thing returned monsieur de morigny since it is love that has disunited us we are both enamoured of one lady and neither of us are disposed to yield up our pretentions however if he had first addressed the lady my friendship for him would have induced me to make an effort to subdue my passion but since i saw and loved her first i expect he should make a sacrifice such as i would do in his situation i spoke to him to this purpose this evening as we both came away together from mademoiselle de montmartin for that is the name of the young lady we love i know not how he received what i said but i explained myself in a manner sufficiently intelligible and it is not my fault if he did not understand my meaning  the chevalier was extremely afflicted at this discourse he foresaw that if these friends should have a duel during his stay at fontainebleau he should be obliged according to the rules of that false notion of honor which then prevailed in france to offer himself as a second to monsieur de morigny he was not deceived in his conjecture monsieur de morigny was scarce awake the next morning when a gentleman desired admittance to him he ordered him to be shown immediately into his apartment after the first civilities the gentleman told him that the young marquis de saintsauveur desired to see him immediately with his sword in his hand to give him satisfaction for the injurious treatment he had received from him the evening before the gentleman added that the marquis had done him the honor to choose him for his second and therefore he entreated him to fix upon one of his friends for the same service monsieur replied morigny with great composure i am ready to give your friend the satisfaction he demands but i will have no second and i know you are a man of so much honor that upon the security of your word i will go alone to meet my adversary  i expected such an answer from one of your courage and generosity replied the gentleman and in the same circumstances i would make such a one myself but you doubtless know better than i that custom in this place gives the law to reason the business of seconds is to be witnesses of the conduct of their friends not to fight themselves but the contrary has obtained by long use and you and i are too young to establish new laws i entreat you then monsieur to employ some one of your friends upon this occasion or permit me to tell the marquis de saintsauveur that you refuse to give him the ordinary means of satisfaction  monsieur de morigny was going to make the gentleman some answer when the chevalier des essars suddenly entered the room he had heard that some person had enquired for monsieur de morigny and judging by the discourse he had with him the evening before that the marquis de saintsauveur would infallibly send a challenge the next morning he rose hastily and wrapping his nightgown about him slipped into a place from whence he could overhear their conversation he rushed into the room upon hearing the gentleman say these last words what is the matter gentlemen said he you seem to be disputing some point is there no way to bring you to an accommodation i have thought added he without giving them time to reply of an expedient to put an end to your contest for i suspect the design monsieur that brought you here i declare then that if monsieur de morigny will not accept the challenge with the conditions you bring him i offer to take it upon myself and will attend your call whenever you please you are too generous my dear chevalier said monsieur de morigny embracing him and since you will have it so let us dress ourselves instantly and meet the marquis de saintsauveur at the place appointed  it was with infinite pain and regret that the chevalier took this step no quarrel of his own had ever given him so much uneasiness he was under terrible apprehensions that by it he should ruin himself with the old marquis de saintsauveur and the count of berci his friend he was preparing to assist monsieur de morigny against the young marquis de saintsauveur at the hazard of all the fatal consequences that might result from this combat but these considerations were weak compared to that of incurring the displeasure of his dear countess he had reason to expect that she would be highly incensed against him yet terrible as this thought was that notion of false honor to which the bravest men were slaves at that time made him resolve at the expense of all that was dear to him to comply with it unjust and cruel law which reasonable men imposed upon themselves those destructive maxims cannot be rejected with too much horror nor can their influence during that miserable period be too highly lamented every day teemed with the fates of some brave youths who wantonly sacrificed each others lives in support of a quarrel wherein they had no part and which they had heard of but a few moments before this madness they carried still farther a man would have thought himself injured and have publicly complained of the injustice that was done him if on such an occasion his friend had not made choice of him for his second and if it happened that he was informed of the dispute he would with the utmost eagerness run to offer his arm to revenge the often imaginary wrong it very frequently happened that the adversary to whom he was to be opposed was one of his inmate friends yet it would have been dishonorable if he had scrupled on these glorious occasions to have deprived him of life we cannot give too many praises to that prince truly worthy of the name of great who by wise edicts supported by illustrious examples of a salutary rigor at length suppressed this savage gallantry which every day carried off some of the flower of his nobility and the bravest men in his kingdom but let us resume the thread of our history and see what passed at the house of monsieur de morigny  as soon as it was determined there that they should fight two against two the chevalier des essars and monsieur de morigny dressed themselves in haste and were conducted by the gentleman into one of the most private parts of the forest of fontainebleau where they found the young marquis de saintsauveur waiting for them on horseback they all dismounted in an instant and stripping themselves to their shirts the chevalier des essars and the gentleman left the young marquis de saint sauveur and monsieur de morigny to terminate their real dispute while they went to put an end to their imaginary one however they assaulted each other with no less fury than the two others and after both had made several passes without success they closed and each received a wound from his adversary the chevalier passed his sword through the gentlemans right thigh and was himself wounded at the same time in the left arm the gentleman no longer able to stand fell upon the ground and the chevalier des essars too generous to take advantage of his good fortune and having not the least design to terminate by the death of his adversary the combat which was now become unequal spoke to him in these terms  let us put an end monsieur to a dispute which began on our friends account we have no reason to hate each other take my advice let us content ourselves with the blood we have mutually shed and do you permit me to go and endeavor to separate two men whom a trifle has made enemies  he quitted the gentleman that instant without waiting for his answer and ran eagerly to the two rivals who had both given and received several wounds but in the moment as he was advancing toward them the sword of the young marquis by a stroke of his enemys broke in the middle the unfortunate youth seeing the chevalier des essars approach alone with his sword drawn and bloody did not doubt but that he had killed his friend and was come to the assistance of monsieur de morigny but not suffering these apprehensions to appear he redoubled his efforts although he had now nothing but a broken sword to defend himself with and resolved to sell his life dearly but the chevalier des essars throwing himself between the combatants entreated them to stop a moment and listen to him  you are both brave said he neither has had any advantage over the other but what chance not superior skill or strength has given i therefore conjure you gentlemen to remember your former friendship once so tender and sincere and do not rashly sacrifice it to so slight a difference as yours is can you refuse to grant this favor to two friends who have so lately exposed their lives and shed their blood for you  well marquis said monsieur de morigny will you not now confess yourself vanquished when with only a broken sword you have the chevalier des essars and me also to oppose  no answered the brave marquis de saintsauveur with a generous indignation i am not vanquished do not flatter yourselves that you have this advantage over me you are indeed masters of my life fortune has delivered it into your hands but you cannot take my courage from me although i am deprived of the means of defending myself live then replied monsieur de morigny charmed with the young marquiss courage and noble contempt of death live unconquered and invincible the poor advantage i have gained i owe only to fortune i claim no triumph from it and all i contest for is that i may not be overcome in virtue and generosity  ah my dear morigny replied the young marquis i now acknowledge you have truly vanquished me when with such greatness of soul you give me a life which you might have deprived me of without shame and injustice but which my courage would never have suffered me to ask for yes dear morigny my eyes are opened in thee i no longer behold a rival and an enemy but see with joy a virtuous and magnanimous friend my heart softened by thy generosity resigns for ever its hatred and desire of revenge suffer me then with this tender and sincere embrace to assure you that i have the highest esteem for your virtues and the utmost gratitude for the kindness you have shown me saying this he threw away his broken sword and ran into the arms of monsieur de morigny they continued a long time in a strict embrace and reciprocally conjured each other to forget they had ever had any difference vowing a perpetual friendship for the future which no consideration whatever should have power to break  the marquis de saintsauveur then enquiring of monsieur de morigny the name of his generous friend he turned to the chevalier des essars and politely thanked him for the generosity he had shown him and which he had not merited entreating him in the most obliging terms to grant him the honor of his friendship the chevalier met these advances of the young marquis de saintsauveur with a politeness full of modesty and respect he embraced him tenderly and they both vowed an eternal friendshp  mean time the chevalier des essars lost a great deal of blood but the friend of the marquis de saintsauveur lost much more that gentleman was so weakened by his wound and the great effusion of blood from it that he had not been able to rise they all ran to the place where the chevalier des essars had left him and found him more sensible of his misfortune in not having been able to follow the chevalier than of the pain of his wound but when he was informed of the happy event of the combat between his friend and monsieur de morigny he congratulated them both with a sincere joy  the whole court was already informed of this duel the challenge had not been sent with such secresy but mademoiselle de montmartin who was the occasion of it had notice of it a few moments afterward several of the young lords of the court to whom she had communicated the affair mounted immediately to go in search of the rivals and to separate them but not knowing the spot they had chosen to decide their quarrel they wandered about a long time in the forest and did not find them till the combat was over the first that discovered them were the friends of the gentleman who had been wounded in the thigh they caused a handlitter to be made immediately with some branches they broke off the trees and carried him to fontainebleau the marquis de saintsauveur earnestly recommended him to the care of his attendants and took leave of him with great tenderness expressing the utmost concern for his wound and then mounting his horse he joined the chevalier des essar and monsieur de morigny and they rode all together after renewing their protestations of an inviolable friendship for the future monsieur de morigny and the chevalier des essars took the road to paris and the marquis de saintsauveur that which led to the castle of his brotherinlaw the count of berci for their combat had made it dangerous for them to return to fontainebleau  the old marquis de saintsauveur who had risen very early that morning to visit his wounded servants was informed by one of his footman of the duel fought by his son which already made a great noise at fontainebleau he sent immediately to his sons lodgings to be more particularly informed and his messenger was told that the young lord went out very early in the morning with three other gentlemen on horseback with an intention as it was supposed to fight and that several of the courtiers had mounted their horses and were gone to separate them this news filled the old man with the most dreadful alarms he mounted a horse that instant and galloped after them and soon met the men who carried the wounded gentleman from whom he was informed of the event of the combat the good old man then returned to fontainebleau and after recommending his servants to the care of the surgeons he took the road to the castle of beauplan whither he did not doubt his son had retired his eagerness to see him and be assured that he was not dangerously hurt made him use such speed that the young lord was still in the embraces of the count and countess of berci when he arrived  the countess and her brother felt very different sentiments at the sight of their father hers was all joy and tenderness his surprise and confusion after the old marquis had embraced his soninlaw and his daughter the young marquis approached to pay his duty to him and was received with equal tenderness as the others the good old gentleman seeming not to perceive that he had his arm in a scarf but as soon as they were all seated at table the countess of berci observed it for the first time certainly said she you have some reasons which you are unwilling to own for wearing this scarf i cannot believe you carry it in triumph as a favor from a mistress but rather that you are obliged through necessity to wear it i beg you will explain this mystery to me it has an appearance that gives me great inquietude  i own to you sister replied the young marquis that i am obliged to wear this scarf on account of a violent pain i feel in my arm but it is not dangerous therefore do not be uneasy about it i know son said the old marquis that your arm gives you some pain but pray tell the true cause of it to your sister i shall raise another quarrel between you and a gentleman i met in the forest of fontainebleau to day if you relate the affair differently from what he told it the young marquis blushed at these words and not doubting but that his father was fully informed of the whole affair he related it to his brotherinlaw and his sister very succinctly praising particularly the generosity of monsieur de morignys second who he said had saved his life in the very moment that his sword was broken in his hand and he owned that he could not have avoided death if that brave man had not eagerly thrown himself between him and his adversary  the young marquis was about to tell the name of his deliverer when he stopped through respect perceiving his father was going to speak son said the old gentleman you have to day had a very narrow escape let me advise you never to tempt an unnecessary danger there are accidents enough which happen in the world by which the life of a brave man may be shortened there is no occasion to seek death he comes too often unexpected and undesired your rashness was the cause of your danger this day but that which i escaped yesterday was the mere effect of ill fortune i was attacked in the forest of fontainebleau by a band of robbers who wounded two of my most faithful servants and put the rest to flight i could not have avoided sinking under their strokes but for an assistance more than human i think which was brought me when my strength had almost wholly forsaken me a gentleman on horseback came to my relief when i despaired of safety he appeared like the avenging thunder of heaven he either overthrew or dispersed all my enemies in a few moments i could not view him plainly because it was almost dark but he had the air and port of a hero as well as the valor and courage of one but his modesty exceeded every thing i ever met with i could not help being grieved at it because it robbed me of the pleasing satisfaction of knowing to whom i was obliged for my life however he answered my enquiries with excuses so polite and with such a graceful sweetness that i durst not take the liberty to press him any farther i thought i should have failed in respect and gratitude if i had urged him to reveal a secret which he doubtless had reasons for concealing from me  at these words one of the old marquiss servants who waited at his chair stepping a little forward said monsieur the gentleman who came to your assistance in the wood is called the chevalier des essars his valet de chamber told it me yesterday as we pursued our journey after the combat and he added that he had left this castle the same day but hearing his master make you excuses for not telling his name he earnestly entreated me not to mention to you what he had told me i likewise believe that he is the same person who fought this morning with the gentleman we met in the forest for i heard it said that his adversary came to fontainebleau but last night  the young marquis de saintsauveur was the only person present who could clear up a mystery which perplexed every one else he accordingly declared that the valiant man to whom both his father and himself owed the preservation of their lives was the chevalier des essars a general astonishment seized the company all were eager to give the chevaliers valor and modesty the praises so justly due the satisfaction and joy which the countess of berci felt at this news was silent but not less sincere she was afraid of indulging herself in any expressions of it lest she should give cause of suspicion to her brotherin law this young man kept a profound silence and seemed unwilling to give the chevaliers virtues that tribute of just praise which every other person allowed him the company observed his uneasiness the effect of a mean and malicious envy it is the quality of that unjust passion when it cannot blacken a superior and generallyacknowledged merit to give pain and grief to its owner at the applauses with which it is honored the countess in her heart set a just value upon the services her family had received from the chevalier des essars she praised him cautiously but inwardly acknowledged that a lover so brave and generous deserved her most tender esteem  the old marquis de saintsauveur remained fifteen days at beauplan after which he returned with his son to fontainebleau he found his two servants dead of their wounds which gave him a very sensible grief the chevalier des essars and monsieur de morigny being but slightly wounded soon recovered their health as also the young marquis de saintsauveur and his second but love which raged with a cruel violence in the heart of the wretched chevalier poisoned all his joys and made glory itself tasteless to him  absence that remedy so often successful in love rendered the chevaliers passion more ardent he was not able to taste any pleasure while he remained banished from beauplan the idea of the countess of berci pursued him every where a lover less respectful than himself after having been so happy as to render two such signal services to the father and brother of his mistress would not have hesitated to have presented himself before her but awed by her commands to the contrary he rather chose to pine in absence and fall a victim to the torments that consumed him than offend her he was likewise apprehensive that the two marquises de saintsauveur were still at beauplan but it was the presence of young berci which he dreaded more than that of any other he knew he was acquainted with his passion for the countess his sisterinlaw he trembled at the thoughts of such an interested observer as he would prove he could not hope for an opportunity of entertaining the countess amidst such a crowd of relations and friends so many obstacles were not capable of damping one moment the ardour of his passion his impatience to see the charming countess increased with the difficulties of gratifying it yet he determined to stay at paris till he had by a letter demanded her permission to wait on her at beauplan and he fixed upon one of his servants whose fidelity he had often experienced to be the bearer of it  during the time that the chevalier had resided with the count he became acquainted with a woman who lived in a village at a small distance from the castle he foresaw that he might one day have occasion for her assistance in his passion and by rich presents he had entirely secured her in his interest he was too prudent and had too much respect for the countess of berci to make her the confidant of his love for that lady therefore he told her that he was fond of one of her women whose name was marianne this girl was greatly beloved by the countess and entirely possessed her confidence the chevalier had gained her by the same methods as the countrywoman and she had promised him to deliver his letters to her lady the chevalier wrote to the countess with a trembling hand and a heart agitated by a thousand fears he gave the letter to his servant with full instructions how to act ordering him above all things not to go to beauplan till it was night and to set out again from thence at the first dawn of day  this faithful domestic executed his masters orders with the utmost exactness he delivered the letter to the woman it was enclosed in a cover directed to marianne he likewise gave her two chains of gold from his master one for marianne and the other for herself in reward of her fidelity the next day the countrywoman after locking up the chevaliers servant in her house went to the castle of beauplan and easily acquitted herself of her commission no person in the house having the least suspicion of the cause of her coming marianne took an opportunity to give the letter to the countess when she retired in the evening to her closet madam de berci was at first surprised and angry at the boldness of her woman she reproved her severely and for a long time refused to receive the letter from her hands but this girl who had some power over the mind of her mistress and who wanted neither wit nor cunning used so many arguments to prove that she might without reproach receive a letter from a man to whom she owed such extraordinary obligations that the countess overcame at length by her reasons and secretly persuaded by the motions of her own heart took the chevaliers letter from her and opening it with extreme agitation read these words  how shall a lover madam whom you have condemned to silence whom you have banished from your sight make known the violence of his passion yet to be allowed to make you sensible that he loves you is the only consolation he requires is it too much presumption to wish to be pitied by you when pity is all he dares hope for or request but how can you pity unless you are a witness of the torments i endure and how can you be a witness of them while i remain banished from your sight consider madam i beseech you that this exile which i have suffered is your own work at length relent and permit me to approach you again afford me the blessing of beholding you it is all i ask and it is the only means of preserving a life which i would lose with pleasure to do you service your answer will determine my fate  the countess of berci was greatly affected with this letter some sighs escaped her unknown to herself the chevaliers respectful passion lulled all her suspicions asleep and the unhappy state of his mind excited her pity nevertheless she was in doubt whether she ought to write him an answer reason and honor dictated to her that a virtuous woman ought not to indulge herself in a correspondence however innocent with a man who is her professed lover but gratitude and compassion pleaded the chevaliers cause with such inresistable force that she flattered herself she might write to him and even see him without wounding the duty she owed her husband the count of berci designed the next day to accompany his father and brother to fontainebleau she therefore resolved not only to write an answer to the chevalier but also to take advantage of her husbands absence to give him an interview in private and taking up the pen she wrote to him in these words  i answer your letter monsieur contrary to the rules my duty imposes upon me to put you in mind of yours which is to cease a pursuit that will infallibly be fruitless and may be fatal hope for nothing from me beyond esteem and gratitude the one i cannot refuse your merit and i owe the other to the services you have lately rendered me in the persons of my father and brother i am willing to believe that you love me with honor and this thought alone prevails with me to grant you permission to see me i shall be alone on friday in the afternoon if this letter reaches you soon enough you may come to beauplan and at eleven oclock at night you will find the garden door open and marianne attending to conduct you to me see monsieur what hazards i run to express my acknowledgement for the obligations you have conferred upon me but again i warn you not to expect that you can ever inspire me with any other sentiments than what the most rigid virtue will permit a reasonable woman to entertain  the countess who was too innocent and unexperienced to reflect on the consequences of such a suspicious interview was very well satisfied with the terms in which she had conceived her letter but this false step however guiltless she was in intention was soon followed by the most dreadful alarms it exposed her to the greatest danger she had ever been in during her whole life and was the source of all those misfortunes she afterward proved the countrywoman returned the next morning to the castle and received the answer which the countess had written from the hands of marianne that girl pretended it was a letter from her to the chevalier des essars the chevaliers servant set out for paris as soon as it was dark and mindful of his masters orders made such haste that he arrived there early the next day although there was nothing in the countesss letter which could flatter the chevalier with a hope of being more happy than compassion restrained by duty could make him yet it filled him with inconceivable transport and he mounted on horseback that instant in order to be at beauplan at the appointed time  the count of berci took horse to attend his father and brotherinlaw to fontainebleau that very day on which the chevalier arrived at beauplan as he went only in complaisance to the marquis and his son they would not suffer him to go farther than half way and then obliged him to return back the countess who had not expected to see her husband that night was greatly perplexed at his return she now repented of the assignation she had made the chevalier des essars and was in dreadful uneasiness lest it should be discovered yet she concealed her agitations from her husband as well as she possibly could but she was too much disordered to be able to eat any supper the count was uneasy supposing she was indisposed madam de berci eagerly catched at that expedient and made it her excuse for retiring immediately after supper to her chamber the count attributing his wifes indisposition to her grief at parting with her father and brother obligingly endeavored to console her and conducting her to her apartment withdrew to his own  the night was dark and cloudy and savoured the desires of the chevalier des essars who was very solicitious to prevent being seen near the castle of beauplan lest it should reflect any dishonor upon the character of his mistress the whole family was already enjoying the sweets of a profound repose when marianne going softly out of her ladys apartment went to the gate she there found the passionate chevalier who loverlike had through impatience come an hour sooner than he was directed and had waited for her with great anxiety marianne did not fail to exaggerate the danger to which she exposed herself to do him service and protested her zeal for his interest so strongly that the chevalier who thought the moments too precious to waste in thanks took a fine ring off his finger and gave it to the faithful confidant in acknowledgement of her kindness she then desired him to follow her with the utmost precaution and brought him without being discovered into the apartment of the countess madam de berci looked so charming in the elegant undress she was in that the chevalier lost in admiration and desire almost forgot the condition upon which he was permitted to see her but the lovely countess who was capable of inspiring at once respect and love represt this first transport by a modest regard full of mingled sweetness and severity then desiring the chevalier to be seated she spoke thus to him  if you knew monsieur the danger to which i expose my reputation and perhaps my life by seeing you here these slight charms would take up less of your attention my lord is not at fontainebleau with my father as i expected he would have been this night he is retired to his own chamber in complaisance to me his unexpected return to beauplan perplexed me greatly and in order to keep my word with you i have been obliged to feign myself indisposed do not then monsieur abuse a favor which i could not refuse to your earnest entreaties and to the interest i take in the preservation of your life which you have so lately ventured in the service of my family in your favor i have in some degree transgressed the laws of decorum the consideration i have had for you ought to secure your gratitude and to prevent your forming any hopes from a condescension i cannot help condemning in myself know this is the last time you must ever expect to see me alone  the countess had scarce uttered these last words when some body knocked hastily at the door of the antichamber the chevalier did not doubt but it was the count and began to suspect that madam de berci had laid this snare to ruin him when he was first told that a man whom he had supposed to be at fontainebleau was in his own chamber in that very house he entertained some suspicions against the countess but had already rejected them as too injurious to that amiable lady when the noise at the door of her antichamber awaked them again in his mind and now not doubting any longer that he was betrayed madam said he to the countess you had many other ways of freeing yourself from a passion which you doubtless thought too importunate without sacrifising me to your husbands revenge but be assured madam i will not lose my life without putting that of your lords into danger into whose hands you have delivered me  ah how you injure me by these suspicions replied the countess half dead with fear it is not now a time to endeavor by oaths to assure you of my sincerity but the testimony you will soon have of it will make you know the injustice you do me but retire i conjure you behind the tapistry you will be absolutely safe from a discovery there and if you are not convinced of my innocence sacrifice my life to your revenge she spoke these words with a low voice and then called marianne who had heard the knocking at the door but like one that understood her business well made no offers to stir till she had directions from her lady the chevalier a little reassured by his mistress words placed himself behind the tapistry holding it close with his left hand but through a little opening which he left that he might see who came into the room he held a pocketpistol which he resolved in case of necessity to use in his own defense  marianne as if hardly awake came into her ladys room with a loose gown on and went to open the door of the antichamber to her lord for it was he that demanded entrance the count as he approached his wife passed so near the place where the chevalier was concealed that he touched the end of the pistol the chevalier acknowledged afterward that he was never so much alarmed in his life but the count went on without observing any thing and seeing that his wife was not yet in bed he sat down upon the sopha which the chevalier had quitted but a few moments before and with a look of tender anxiety which relieved the countess from some part of her fears enquired how she did  madam de berci answered in a low voice that she had been worse since supper that she was feverish and just going to bed to try if she could get a little rest which she hoped would relieve her the count taking her hand felt her pulse which from the terrors with which she was agitated beating a little unequally you are indeed disordered said the tender count but i hope your illness will not be dangerous i could not be easy till i saw you i have been but a few moments in bed yet was terrified by a horrid dream from which i awaked in agonies i dreamt a monstrous dragon was going to devour you your indisposition which i had imagined was but slight rose to my thoughts i began to be apprehensive that this was the dragon and that you were grown much worse since i saw you i came eagerly to know the state of your health and thank heaven i find it better than i expected but why are you not in bed let me have the satisfaction to see you enjoying a quiet sleep before i return to my own apartment  the chevaliers suspicions returned when he heard the count relate his dream he was absolutely persuaded that he was discovered and the countess dreadfully alarmed knew not what to expect the counts interpretation of his dream reassured them a little but when they found he intended to stay some time longer and that he pressed madam de berci to go to bed all again seemed lost the chevalier was apprehensive that he should not be able to continue long in the situation he was in for it was extremely uneasy nevertheless as he had a great deal of courage and was very much in love the hope of the counts retiring in an hour supported him under so disagreeable a restraint but he indulged his ill humor with secretly execrating this too tender husband who after three years marriage came so unseasonably to give his wife a proof of his fondness  the countess of berci was obliged to go to bed and under pretense that the taper which the count had brought in with him glared too full in her eyes she ordered marianne to draw the curtain on that side where the chevalier stood concealed marianne obeying her ladys orders with too much precipitation disingaged herself from a little dog which had followed the count into his wifes apartment the animal being free ran to the place where the trembling lover was concealed and discovering instinctively that a stranger was in the room he began to bark so loud that the count was rising from his seat to endeavor to pacify him himself but the countess in great agitation held back her husband and marianne coaxing the little creature into good humor at last catched him in her arms and carried him into her own chamber where she did not fail to beat him severely for his unseasonable fidelity to his master  the countess of beri finding her husband resolved to stay still she was quite composed was obliged to counterfeit herself asleep and the count when he was assured she was so rising softly went out of her apartment and retired to his own his absence relieved the countess and the chevalier from terrible inquietude the ardent lover as soon as he was withdrawn left the place of his concealment and went to the countesss bedside where he threw himself on his knees and implored her pardon for the ungenerous suspicion he had entertained the countess sweetly blushing at the situation she was in before her lover told him she had already pardoned him and hoped that for the future he would judge more heartily of her sincerity and honor the chevalier scarce listened to what she said he had not only forgot his past danger but also the conditions to which he had bound himself when he requested an interview with the countess  insolent man cried the countess darting a disdainful look at him and pushing him away with all her force is it thus that you abuse the credulity of an unhappy woman who has so lately exposed both her honor and her life for you base and ungrateful as you are was it to cover your impious designs that these appearances of respect and submission were assumed but go avoid my sight and thank my clemency that i content myself with depriving you for ever of my esteem without making you feel the just effects of my indignation  ah madam replied the impetuous chevalier how can you imagine i should be master of myself exposed to the assault of so many charms my passion is stronger than my reason its violence is my excuse and i ought less to excite your anger for my presumption than your compassion for the miseries i have suffered these words were not calculated to remove the countesss anger any more than the behavior by which they were followed that unfortunate lady now first perceiving the danger to which she had exposed her virtue assumed more courage and resolution she called marianne with loud cries the terror she was in not giving her time to reflect that her husband might be alarmed her woman appearing the chevalier full of repentance for his attempt retired from the bedside the countess no longer observing any terms with him commanded him with a look and voice which made him tremble to leave her chamber and fiercely threatened to send for her lord and show him the real dragon which he had seen only in his dream unless he obeyed her that instant  it was in vain that the unhappy chevalier endeavored by tears and prayers to soften the anger of his incensed mistress she was inexorable and he was obliged to quit her with the grief of knowing that he had lost her esteem by giving way to the impetuosity of his desires fatal love blind and ungovernable passion thy highest favors are too deerly purchased by the dangers the inquietude and the remorse thou causest  the unfortunate chevalier full of shame and grief was a hundred times ready to run his sword through his heart before the eyes of madam de berci adieu madam said he to her my unfeigned repentance and the miserable life i am going to drag on at a distance from you will i hope one day procure me pardon for an attempt as fruitless as it was involuntary  the countess did not deign to say a single word to him in answer and the chevalier not daring to importune her any farther made her a low bow and followed marianne who conducted him to the door of the antichamber without any light for fear of being perceived the chevalier was in such agitation of mind that he hardly knew what he was doing and as he descended the stairs his foot slipping he tumbled down and the pistol which he held in his hand for fear of some accident went off and alarmed the whole house  the count his brother and several of the men servants got up immediately and made the castle resound with their cries of thieves assassins the countess at the report of the pistol was almost distracted with her apprehensions she heard her lords voice and knew not whether the chevalier had fied at him or the count at the chevalier marianne who had quitted the chevalier at the door of the antichamber and who knew not any more than her lady the true cause of what had happened trembled at the punishment which she expected and bemoaned herself piteously the whole castle was full of tumult and disorder  in the mean time the chevalier who found himself at the bottom of the staircase by his fall missing his hat and his pistol resolved not to leave them behind him though by staying to look for them he run the danger of being seized but he was sensible if those things were found it would be known that it was he who had been there and that was equal to a discovery of his person the moon gave light enough through the windows to direct his search and he was so fortunate as to find both his hat and pistol and to reach the garden gate without being discovered some of the counts servants ran thither a few moments after and finding the gate open they supposed the thieves had escaped that way they had a glimpse of the chevalier as he ran but it was not light enough for them to distinguish his person however supposing him to be one of the rogues they pursued him but the chevalier made such speed that he joined his servant who was waiting for him before the fellows could come up with him and mounting his horse which his man held ready he gallopped across the country without keeping any direct road and at last got to a village where he concealed himself for a few hours and then returned to paris  the end of the first part the history of the chevalier des essars and the countess of berci part ii the count of berci and his brother who had been among the first that were alarmed by the report of the pistol having as has been already said risen in haste they armed themselves with their swords and pistols and followed by some of the servants who carried flambeaux in their hands they went to the apartment of the countess whose terror at seeing her lord and his brother enter with such a formidable equipage was so great that she fainted away the the count full of grief at this accident ran eagerly to her remedies were applied but her husbands tender solicitude and the affectionate things he said to her had more efficacy in recovering her spirits than all the other endeavors which were used for that purpose  it was her fear that the chevalier had been discovered which reduced her to that condition but her lords excessive concern for it convinced her that the chevalier had had the good fortune to escape without being known this thought restored her spirits and the count entirely dissipated all her suspicions by telling her that the tumult and noise there had been in the house was occasioned by some rogues who had attempted to rob it  i beg madam said he embracing her tenderly that you will not suffer yourself to be alarmed thus to the prejudice of your health my brother and myself will go and search every part of the castle that we may be assured none of these villains are concealed in it banish your fears then and depend upon it added he smiling that if we find some of these rogues lurking here still we will give you a good account of them he then ordered the countesss woman to be called to stay in the chamber and leaving two of the footmen to guard the door of her apartment he went with his brother and the others to search the castle  the count after traversing over the whole house went down into the court yard where he met two of his servants who had just returned from pursuing the chevalier they had run after him a long time in the fields but the chevalier being well mounted as were his servants likewise he was soon out of sight and the counts footmen thinking it was needless to follow them any farther at such a disadvantage came home no wiser than they went  as soon as they saw the count they related to him what they had done and as in their terrified imaginations the chevalier and his servant appeared to be five or six men so they did not fail to double the number and confidently affirm that there were no less than a dozen rogues whom their presence unarmed as they were put to flight another who had a mind to have it said that he also had a share in this terrible adventure declared with great firmness of countenance that it was at him the rogue who had got entrance into the house fired the pistol and that he heard the whizzing of the ball as it happily past by his ear without hurting him  the count of berci fully persuaded that the castle had been beset by robbers went up to his wifes apartment i told you madam said he as he entered that there was nothing to apprehend my servants have just now informed me that the thieves alarmed at the noise we made and by the lights supposing the whole family was up are fled with the utmost precipitation one of them had it seems got over the garden walls in order to open the gate to the others but as soon as it is day i shall take care to prevent such attempts for the future by making it impossible for any one to climb over those walls again think no more then i conjure you madam of what is past all now is safe try to calm your mind and get an hour or twos repose i am extremely apprehensive that the alarms you have suffered this night will disorder you greatly  the countess full of inward remorse which her lords excessive tenderness redoubled begged him to retire to his own chamber and she would try to compose herself she could scarce retrain her tears as she spoke her voice faltered the count saw her greatly disordered but far from guessing the cause he concluded all was owing to the terrors she had been in on account of the attempt he supposed had been made on the castle he desired her women to watch by their lady and then taking leave of her with a tender embrace and an ardent ejaculation for her health he returned to his own apartment  the countess as soon as her lord was withdrawn commanded her women to quit her chamber she longed to be alone to give free vent to her tears a woman who has just notions of honor needs no other tormentors when she has transgressed the strict laws of it than the stings of her own conscience madam de berci had through ignorance of the world and by her too great sensibility of the services the chevalier had done her family been betrayed to make a false step which she too late acknowledged to be so her eyes were opened by the chevaliers behavior she was enabled to judge of the irregularity of her conduct by the advantage her unworthy lover had endeavored to take of it she trembled at the remembrance of the danger to which she had exposed her virtue she accused herself she exclaimed against the baseness of the chevalier unhappy wretch cried she bursting into tears what have thou done and what would have been thy fate if heaven respecting the innocence of thy intentions had not had compassion upon thee justly detested by a husband who now adores thee thy least punishment if he had spared thy life would have been to be confounded with women of infamous reputation upon whose forehead is engraved in characters never to be effaced the shameful story of their crimes and oh fatal aggravation of my folly such a husband  blush blush ungrateful wretch at the remembrance of his tenderness what return have thou made for this unexampled affection thou have not scrupled to endanger the quiet of his whole life by submitting to a private interview with a man whose wild passion thou wast but too well acquainted with thou have introduced into his house at the dead of night the premeditated assassin of his honor thou may judge unhappy woman by the grief with which thou saw him overwhelmed for thy feigned sickness what would have been his agonies if thy fatal secret had been discovered oh may thou be ever ignorant of it my dear and injured lord and may my repentance and my tears blot out of my heart the image of that most insolent and most base of men  with such complaints and in such bitter reflections did the unhappy countess waste the remaining part of the night quiet was banished from her mind and sleep from her eyes the morning found her bathed in tears and seized with the first symptoms of a fever which in a few days increased to such a degree that her life was despaired of her lord almost distracted at the danger she was in never quitted her a moment during eight days that the physicians thought her recovery doubtful her youth at length and her good constitution overcame the violence of her disease she began to recover though by slow degrees and in this state we shall leave her and see what passed at fontainebleau where we left the old marquis de saintsauveur  as soon as he arrived he went immediately to pay his respects to his majesty his gracious master under whom he had made his last campaigns his design was to solicit a pardon for his son as likewise for the chevalier des essars to whom he was so greatly obliged that great monarch who never forgot the services of his faithful subjects gave the marquis a most gracious reception and with that affability which was so natural to him welcomed him to court and enquired into the motive which had induced him to quit his retreat  sire replied the old man the desire of seeing once more the greatest and best of kings and of embracing my children has brought me again and probably for the last time to court i find myself hasting forward to my decay and all that for the future i shall be able to do will be to pray for your majestys glory and happiness but i would beg leave to present a young man to you in my stead who eagerly pants to follow you in your glorious expeditions and wishes for life only to efface by his courage and loyalty shown in your service the shame and disgrace he has incurred by disobeying your wise laws it is for my son most gracious sovereign that i plead and most humbly implore that your majesty will pardon him a fault he has committed lately and impute it to the wild sallies of inconsiderate youth and not to stubborn will and premeditated disobedience  monsieur de saintsauveur said that generous prince if your son has failed in the respect and obedience he owes me by his last combat i have not forgot those in which you have formerly shed your blood for my service i therefore not only grant you his pardon which i cannot refuse to your services but also that of the chevalier des essars which probably you was afraid to ask for i have been informed of your adventure in the forest of fontainebleau the assistance he so generously gave you and his valor in saving your life engages me to grant this and to pardon him out of consideration to you  sire replied the old man in a rapture throwing himself at the kings feet i have not words to express my grateful sense of your majestys goodness in thus granting me the life of my son your majesty who like a god has read those wishes in my heart which i did not dare to give utterance to best knows how much i am affected with your unmerited indulgence yes my gracious lord you have prevented my most ardent desires and by granting me the life of the chevalier des essars you have given me an opportunity of returning in some degree the obligations i have to that valiant man to whose generosity i owe the happiness i now enjoy of embraceing the knees of my indulgent master  the old marquis then stepping to his son who was standing behind a crowd of courtiers approach my son said he and bless the clemency of your prince who has been pleased at my intercession to pardon you and resolve to prove to him one day that the life you have received from me and which his goodness has preserved belongs wholly to him and remember that you never more must hazard it but in his service  the young marquis approaching with a graceful modesty threw himself at the kings feet who raised him up instantly and assured his father that he would take the care of his sons fortune entirely upon himself  in this manner it was that the great henry tempered majesty with sweetness and accompanied those pardons he granted to his offending subjects with the most striking instances of generosity and goodness great and magnanimous prince thy memory will live forever in the hearts of all true frenchmen and thy gentle virtues be as much their love and veneration as thy immortal fame their glory  the marquis de saintsauveur as soon as he had quitted the king retired to his apartment eager to enjoy the delicate pleasure of acquainting the chevalier des essars with what his prince had just done for him he told him in his letter that the pardon he had solicited was granted less to his weak intercession than to his own merit and the fame of his great actions and particularly to the valor and generosity he had shown in exposing his own life in the forest of fontainebleau to save his he added that his modest endeavors to conceal from him the name of his benefactor had all been fruitless and that he had at length had the good fortune to know a man from whom his family were every day receiving new benefits that the last favor he had received from him in preserving the life of his son so greatly endeared the former to him that he despaired of ever finding opportunities sufficient to make known the extent of his gratitude  the good old man after having thus given vent to the overflowings of his grateful heart employed the few remaining hours he staid st fontainebleau in giving some lessons of wisdom and prudence to his son recommending to him in the most earnest manner to persevere in his loyalty to his sovereign and never more to offend him by disobeying his commands  he then set out for his estate in burgundy where he arrived without meeting with any ill accident the marchioness de saintsauveur his wife had heard some reports concerning his adventure in the forest as likewise of her sons duel with monsieur de morigny she had suffered great uneasiness but the recital her lord made her of the happy event of all turned her fears and sorrows into transports of joy she admired the valor of the chevalier des essars whose person she was not acquainted with but whose name and quality she knew and was extremely impatient to see and thank a man to whom she was obliged for the lives of her husband and her son  but of what use was it to this brave man that his merit was acknowledged by his prince and applauded by the public voice since all was not able to comfort him for the loss of his mistresss esteem we have already related how he fortunately escaped being known by the servants of the count of berci after having wandered several days about the country he at last took the road to paris and arrived there full of the deepest despair as he durst not venture abroad on account of his last combat he confined himself to his house all day and went out sometimes at night to visit monsieur de morigny it was not in his power to conceal his sadness from him but all the endeavors of this tender friend to prevail upon him to disclose the cause were ineffectual the chevalier had too much delicacy to make him the confident of his passion for the countess of berci and he rather chose to shut up all his sorrow in his heart and want the consolation of a faithful and sympathising friend than fail in his respect for her who was now dearer to him than ever  he was in this cruel situation when he received the letter from the marquis de saintsauveur it gave him at first a transient relief and he tasted some pleasure in the assurances it brought him of the friendship and esteem of a man who was become so dear to him but a letter which a few days after he received from the count of berci gave him far more satisfaction that tender friend wrote that he had too long deprived him of the pleasure of embracing a man to whom the countess and himself had such great obligations that he could not bear his absence and conjured him to set out immediately for the castle of beauplan where he soon expected the young marquis de saintsauveur and he likewise earnestly entreated him to bring monsieur de morigny with him who he said must be their friend since he was his  the chevalier firmly persuaded that he had lost for ever the esteem of his mistress did not figure to himself any happiness at beauplan farther than that he should enjoy the sight of that inhuman beauty he could not flatter himself that he should be able to obtain her pardon for the offense he had committed but he hoped that his repentance and his grief would excite her pity he therefore resolved to gratify the count of bercis obliging impatience to see him by an immediate departure from paris he showed the counts letter to monsieur de morigny who wearied with the length of his confinement accepted with joy monsieur de bercis obliging invitation beauplan being likewise but half a days journey from court it gave him a better opportunity of soliciting his pardon there than he could do at paris as he had several powerful protectors about the kings person was not the first aggressor and as his majesty had pardoned the marquis de saintsauveur and the chevalier des essars there was room to hope he would not be the only one that was punished and accordingly his friends exerted their interest for him with such success that they obtained his pardon which was sent to him eight days after his arrival at beauplan with the chevalier des essars  the countess of berci was in extreme perplexity when her lord sent to inform her that the chevalier was come the count had not mentioned to her his intention of writing to him at paris he did not doubt but she would be rejoiced to see again a man who had preserved her father and brother he took pleasure in giving her what he thought an agreeable surprise he surprised her indeed more than he imagined but she was far from being pleased the chevalier entered her apartment before she had time to answer her lord he advanced with a respectful awe to salute her a blush caused at once by indignation and shame overspread her face and gave her new charms but the mortification she felt at being obliged to conceal her just rage from the chevalier gave her great pain however the force she put upon herself to behave with complaisance was not perceived and she acted her part so artfully that the chevalier began to conceive hopes she might in time be prevailed upon to forgive him he answered the compliments he made her with freedom and politeness she praised his valor and generosity she returned him thanks for the services her father and brother had received from him but she resolved in her own heart to make him pay dear for the constraint she had been obliged to lay upon herself  the young marquis de saintsauveur and monsieur de morigny continued a long time embraced and fully persuaded of each others merit and reciprocal tenderness they drew more strait than ever the knot of their ancient friendship which nothing after was able to loose monsieur de morigny was received with great kindness by the count of berci and his brother as likewise by the charming countess whom he greatly admired  after the first compliments were over the count of berci related to the chevalier des essars the story of the robbers painting with great vivacity the alarms which the whole family had been in and gave a long account of an affair that the chevalier knew better than himself the chevalier had occasion for all his prudence and art to conceal from the company the embarrassment this recital threw him into the countess who was less able to repress or conceal her emotions showed a concern while the count was speaking sufficient to have betrayed her if it had not been ascribed by him to the remembrance of the terror she had suffered  the chevalier who knew the danger she had been in and saw by her looks that her health had suffered greatly was sensibly afflicted at the inconveniences he had brought upon her he reproached himself a thousand times with his rashness and presumption he cursed the fatal effects of his impetuous passion and endeavored to give her some idea of his grief and repentance by his looks since he could not speak to her he was resolved to try the first opportunity that offered and let her know how much he had suffered from his own remorse for having offended her but be sought in vain for such an opportunity far from giving him one she avoided his looks as much as possible and if by chance her eyes incountered his she would hastily withdraw them again as if she had seen a basilisk  the chevalier again applied for assistance to marianne he entreated this woman to endeavor to make his peace for him he gave her several letters for the countess but she would not receive them and severely reproving her woman for accepting of such commissions forbad her ever to do the like again upon pain of being dismissed from her service and marianne though it would have been her interest to have effected this reconciliation was so terrified at this threat that she would not afterward concern herself in the chevaliers affairs  the unfortunate chevalier had been already fifteen days at beauplan and had used every artifice that love and wit could suggest to procure an interview with the countess but in vain when one day observing the count to be employed in his gardens giving directions to his workmen for some new embellishment the plan of which he had drawn himself he quitted some company that were walking with him and ran to madam de bercis apartment resolving to attempt every thing to gain her pardon but she being always upon her guard against such surprises rose up as soon as she saw her chamber door open and perceiving the chevalier she flew into her closet and fastened the door her lover in despair at this new instance of her rigor said all that a heart torn with remorse could dictate to move her but his complaints his protestations and his grief were fruitless she carried her severity so far that she would not deign even to answer him and he was obliged to withdraw for fear of irritating her still more  her obstinate resentment could not break his chains he had merited it all and his own heart acknowledged that he did so incapable of vanquishing his passion for the countess and despairing of ever being able to gain her pardon he resolved to retire from a house where he was every day exposed to new torments and seek a glorious death in the field  holland was then the theater of war as it was likewise the school for the bravest men that ever distinguished themselves in arms the archduke threatened to attack rhimberg and the states were preparing to defend it the commanders on one side were the marquis de spinola general of the archdukes army and the valiant count de buguoy the first of whom had already acquired immortal glory before ostend with the spaniards and walloons on the other was prince maurice of orange whose name alone is an eulogium he had with him a younger brother who emulous of his glory tread already in his steps he was indeed at the head of an army less numerous than spinolas but it was chiefly composed of the two most gallant nations in the world i mean the french and the english in the troops of the former were many of the nobility commanded by the great bethune and the brave chatillon who were preparing to join the forces of prince maurice  although the chevalier des essars had been treated less cruelly than he was by his mistress yet he loved glory too much to remain an idle spectator in france of the laurels his countrymen were gaining he mentioned his design of making a campaign in holland to the count of berci who not only approved of it but assured him he would go thither likewise and both of them declaring their resolution next morning to monsieur de morigny and the young marquis de saintsauveur they would not be left behind  the count entreated his brother to stay with madam de berci during his absence but this young man full of a noble ardour that could not be repressed was sensible how shameful it would appear to stay in the castle of beauplan and be the guardian of his sisterinlaw while his eldest brother was exposing his life to the uncertain chance of war he resolved therefore to partake his labors and his dangers and all being concluded on they gave orders for their several equipages to be prepared with the utmost expedition  the countess was greatly afflicted when she heard her lords design and that it was the chevalier des essars who had persuaded him to it it was not difficult for her to discover that it was her rigorous treatment of this unfortunate lover which had induced him to take such a resolution she now began to repent of the extreme rigor she had shown which was going to deprive her of a husband so dear to her attributing all her uneasiness to the thoughts of being separated from him but it was in vain that she endeavored to conceal her sentiments from herself she could not without great concern reflect on the dangers to which her lover was going to expose himself and although he had offended her yet she was apprehensive of the effects of his despair and that death which he was going to seek would doubtless deprive her of a lover for whom in spite of all her virtue and her pride she felt in her heart something more tender than esteem but this was a confession she durst not make to herself and studiously avoiding any examination of her own thoughts she endeavored to persuade herself that all her fears were upon her lords account he whom it was her duty to love and by whom she was loved with so much tenderness she resolved therefore to prevail upon the chevalier to lay aside their design she thought she could not have a better motive for breaking through her resolution never to have any private discourse with him and did not in the least doubt that by the power she had over him she could make him abandon a design which he had formed in despair and she persuaded herself that if she succeeded on this side the count her husband would no longer think of leaving her  full of this project the success of which she was sure of in her own imagination she fought for an opportunity to speak to the chevalier which however was not the least difficult part of her undertaking for he who despaired of ever gaining her pardon and fearful of offending her farther took care never to throw himself in her way as usual so that the countess finding herself disapointed in her endeavors to meet him alone was beginning to doubt whether she should ever succeed without making it her request to speak to him a humiliation she would fain have avoided when chance brought her one day into a room fronting the garden where she saw the chevalier alone standing at a window in an attitude that showed he was wholly absorbed in thought  the countess excessively pleased at this accidental meeting approached the window where he stood with an intention to speak to him that very moment when the chevalier supposing she had no other design than to amuse herself with looking out of it left it free to her with a respectful bow and went to the other end of the room where he stood looking at the count of berci and the marquis de saint sauveur and monsieur de morigny who were playing at tennis  it would not be easy to determine whether this behavior gave the countess more shame or vexation but it is certain that she was extremely disappointed she understood this instance of respect in the chevalier to be a plain avowal of contempt how insolent he is said she to herself but i will not give him room to imagine that i am weak enough to run after him no i will rather suffer the loss of all that is dear to me in the world she now leaned upon the window pensive in her turn full of reflections very mortifying to her pride and fain would she have forced herself to believe that her pride only was concerned she felt emotions more painful than those which arise from confusion and anger and the supposed neglect of the chevalier advanced his affairs with the countess more than all the proofs he had hitherto given her of his passion  but he in the mean time observing the countess to be in a deep revery knew not what to think of her behavior he soon began to repent he had left the window and after he had continued looking at the players a few moments though his attention was wholly employed another way he stepped forwards with a design to return to the place he had quitted so unseasonably but the countess who was extremely piqued by what he had done seeing him approach left the window in her turn and went hastily out of the room darting a look at him as she past that upon any other occasion would have given him inexpressible pain but as he now interpreted it filled him with a joy he had never experienced before  he comprehended in an instant all that had passed in the heart of his mistress he was in raptures at this new mark of her rigor and thoroughly acquainted as he was with all the motions of a heart in love he saw with inconceivable transport that the disdain and rage which the countess had darted from her eyes were the effects of affronted tenderness and neglected advances he blessed his good fortune and flattered himself with the sweet idea of being more loved than he had believed he resigned himself up entirely to the intoxicating charms of hope but this alteration in his affairs with the countess far from inducing him to lay aside his former design confirmed him in his resolution of pursuing it the war in holland he did not doubt would afford him opportunities of showing himself worthy of her esteem and this thought alone was sufficient had he been less brave than he was to make him eagerly embrace them  the count and his guests having given over play went to madam de bercis apartment her vexation which was visible enough in her eyes made her lord conclude that she was afflicting herself for his approaching departure which the had often endeavored to prevent he therefore applied himself to make her approve of it as a thing absolutely necessary he represented to her the disgrace he should incur if he neglected so favorable an opportunity of acquiring honor and advancing his fortune assuring her that although his love for her would not permit him to wear out his days in a shameful indolence yet it should hasten his return be urged to her so many strong reasons and so well calculated to make an impression upon the mind of a woman born with just notions of honor that she could not help yielding to them whatever grief it might cost her it was then agreed upon by them both that she should go into the province of burgundy and stay with her father and mother during his absence they earnestly pressing for such a visit and that in two days he should take leave of her to go to paris and finish the preparations for his journey  the countess though greatly displeased with the chevalier for his last behavior was somewhat softened after her discourse with her lord she thought no longer of his supposed neglect she only considered the dangers he was going to expose himself to and whenever she met his eyes which now happened more frequently than before she saw so much grief and tenderness painted in them that she conceived it would be inhuman to deny him the satisfaction of taking a particular leave of her she therefore no longer avoided him as usual and these two lovers having now agreed to speak to each other it was not difficult for them to find an opportunity the chevalier who watched her steps seeing her the evening before they were to set out for paris walking alone in a covered alley he joined her with a respectful air and a timidity which the late discovery he had made could not repress  i know not madam said he to her trembling whether you will condescend to hear for a few moments the most unfortunate of men but i dare flatter myself that if you knew the sincerity of my repentance for having displeased you and all the torments i have suffered from that time your heart insensible as it is would be moved to pity me but if you are severe enough to think my crime not sufficiently punished by your rigor and my own grief death i hope will soon revenge you fully on a wretch who has had the audacity to offend you i shall suffer it without repining i shall meet it with indifference nay to satisfy you i will do more and seek it eagerly that i may at once deliver you from a lover you detest and myself from torments i can no longer support happy still if the sacrifice i shall make you of my life will at length appease your rage which i acknowledge to be just and procure me that compassion i vainly hoped for while i lived chevalier replied the countess looking on him with eyes in which anger and disdain were wholly extinguished let us speak no more of what is past i am willing to forget your crime and remember only your repentance and the services my father and my brother have received from you live then since i am so far from wishing your death that i earnestly conjure you to be careful of yourself do not expose your life to inevitable dangers  i recommend my husband and my brother to your care be watchful over their safety and do not neglect your own yes continued she in a voice more tender your life is dear to me i will not blush to own it  i esteem your person but do not imagine that this confession can authorize you to entertain any hopes to the prejudice of my honor it is innocent though it is frank and without disguise do you then take care to regulate your conduct by it as the sentiments i have for you are not inconsistent with my duty and will be always guided by the strict rules of virtue let me hope that your behavior will be such as shall not give me cause to retract them  the countess of berci stopped at these words expecting her lovers reply but the chevalier was not composed enough to make any for some moments he doubted whether what he had heard was not an illusion of his senses a man who from extreme misery passes rapidly to an excess of good fortune could not be more transported out of himself than the happy chevalier in that sweet moment  ah madam said he with a look and voice expressive of the highest agitation your unmerited goodness is almost as fatal to me as your rigor my heart so long tormented by remorse for having offended you and grief for having lost your esteem can with difficulty bear the transports with which you have filled it by this assurance of your pardon and promise of your returning favor this overpays me for all the torments i have suffered torments that will ever be dear to me since they have produced such happy effects yes madam i will endeavor to preserve my life since you desire i should do so i will submissively obey your commands but will live only to love you with the most pure disinterested affection and to serve you with the most faithful respect  well monsieur returned the charming countess begin then by giving me convincing proofs of the disinterestedness of your affection i love my husband and my brother with the utmost tenderness again i tell you that i confide them to your generous care do not abandon them in the danger to which their rash courage may lead them moderate their ardor and hinder them from exposing their persons unnecessarily bring them back to me again in safety pursued she letting fall some tears from her fine eyes and be assured that my constant esteem will be the price of such a service  the chevalier was preparing to assure the countess that he would pay the most exact obedience to her commands when young berci her brotherinlaw appeared in the walk and interrupted the most pleasing conversation he had ever known how difficult is it for a lover who has lately experienced any unlooked for good fortune to conceal his joy the chevalier at that moment was hardly to be known he was no more the same man plunged in grief and wholly absorbed in melancholy the satisfaction he felt shone in his eyes and enlivened his whole countenance his conversation freed from that restraint he had formerly labored under was now easy and cheerful and as they continued their walk all three together some lively sallies escaped him which gave the countess as good an opinion of his wit as she had of his valor and generosity  it was not difficult for the counts brother to guess the cause of so extraordinary a change he supposed his sisterinlaw had relaxed in her severity to the chevalier and if he did not form suspicions injurious to her virtue he concluded at least that their farewell had been very tender and that they were well assured of each others affection however he prudently dissembled his thoughts and contented himself with observing them carefully all the rest of the evening the lovers perceived it and were more circumspect but their eyes often met and to an interested observer could not fail of betraying their secret sentiments the next day was appointed for their journey to paris the parting between the count and countess was extremely moving they both shed tears and probably the chevalier had some part in those of madam de berci he was not permitted to indulge his grief with any outward expressions of it but his eyes looked a thousand tender farewels which the countess could not but understand  they arrived at paris the same night and stayed there some days to provide themselves with armor and all things that were necessary for their expedition and after they had furnished themselves with letters of exchange for holland they took post for that place leaving orders that their equipages should follow them by easy journies they had the good fortune to arrive eight days before rhineburg was invested which gave them time to throw themselves into the town that they might have part in the glorious defense it made during the three months which the siege of that important place continued  it does not enter into my design to describe here the particulars of a siege which may be read at length in the histories of holland i shall only relate what properly belongs to the subject i am treating the besieged made several sallies with great advantage in all which our volunteers signalised themselves and were very much taken notice of but the chevalier des essars gave so many proofs of his courage that he was looked upon as a prodigy of strength and valor notwithstanding the promises he made to his adored countess he was far from acting with caution he rushed into the thickest dangers and exposed his person in every place where most glory was to be acquired no man understood the art of war better than he did he was particularly skillful in the art of fortification and his advice contributed greatly to prolong the defense of the place he might be seen upon the ramparts like one of the heroes of old overturning all that made any attempts to scale them and fearlessly receiving upon his buckler the innumerable stokes that were aimed at him he was only attentive to the preservation of his two friends the count of berci and the marquis de saintsauveur whose lives were more precious to him than his own he kept them always in his sight and never failed to bring them off in safety when their too great ardour had carried them in spite of his remonstrances into places where their lives were most exposed  the siege of rhineburg had already lasted two months by the uncommon efforts of the warriors who defended the place when it was resolved that a new sally should be made from which they hoped for great advantages a dreadful mine being ordered to be sprung at the same time to favor the sally although our noble frenchmen had been greatly fatigued with their past labors yet they were determined not to miss this opportunity of gathering new laurels the enemies who did not expect this sudden sally were at first put into disorder and fled but soon rallying again the fight was renewed with equal fury on both sides the count of bercis brother rashly engaging himself too far from his own party was taken by the enemies the chevalier not being near enough to prevent his misfortune but being informed of it he resolved cost what it would to recover him he overthrew all that opposed his passage and the enemys troops amazed at a courage and strength which appeared to them more than human dreaded him more than half the garrison he had already slain a great many with his own hand when he perceived that his dear count was just thrown on the ground by a grenadier with a stroke of his sword which however had only stunned him the marquis de saintsauveur his brotherinlaw was near him but had enough to do to defend himself against the blows that were aimed at him on all sides the grenadier was just going to take away the life of the count de berci if the chevalier who never one moment forgot the commands of madam de berci had not flown to his relief he struck down with one blow the grenadier who was going to murder the count and after he had helped him up they both joined to disengage the marquis de saintsauveur who was defending himself alone against three fierce enemies they soon got rid of them and made a horrible slaughter of several others who met their fury the signal for reentering the town being given they obeyed with regret still fighting as they retreated and they were the last that entered having brought off the troops with great glory and success the chevalier was more pleased with his good fortune in having preserved his dear friends than with all the praises that were given him by those who had been witnesses of his actions to have had it in his power to do some service to his beloved countess in the persons of a husband and brother so dear to her gave him more joy than the laurels he had gained with so many dangers and with such loud applause however they were all three greatly afflicted at the misfortune that had happened to young berci a trumpet was sent next day to the general to desire he might be treated with the respect due to his quality his captivity lasted but a short time for he was soon after exchanged for a kinsman of the marquis de spinolas who had been taken prisoner by the besieged  rhineburg had now heldout three months more through the valor of the besieged than the strength of the place the governor despairing of succors and growing destitute of provision and ammunition demanded a capitulation the vigourous dfence he had made was alike glorious to him and advantageous for his party for it effectually hindered the enemies from undertaking any thing considerable during the remainder of the campaign the enemies doing justice to his valor and good conduct allowed him very honorable conditions our volunteers finding that the season was far advanced and that they were not likely to have any more opportunities of signalising themselves took the road back to paris making short journies but it is now time to see how the countess of berci employed herself during the absence of her lord  a few days after his departure from beauplan she set out for burgundy with two of her women and a gentleman whom the count had left to attend her she stopped at an inn at auxerre and as she entered the house saw a young lady who seemed to be just alighted also standing at the window madam de berci thought her extremely handsome and was desirous of having the pleasure of her company during the time they staid there she sent to beg the favor they might dine together the young lady gladly accepted the invitation and entering the countesss apartment both were pleasingly surprised to see each other for in effect this young lady whom the countess did not know at a distance was mademoiselle de montmartin  with whom the young marquis de saintsauveur was in love  they embraced with mutual satisfaction and after the first compliments each asked the other where she was traveling and were infinitely pleased to find that great part of their journey they might be together after dinner they were informed that their coaches were ready but the countess insisted upon mademoiselle de montmartins coming into here is their women being all accommodated in the young ladys coach madam de berci and she had the pleasure of conversing together without restraint  as soon as they had left auxerre the countess informed mademoiselle de montmartin of the occasion of this journey she told her that in the company of her father and mother she was going to seek some consolation for the grief which her lords and her brothers absence had given her who she added were gone to make a campaign in holland mademoiselle de montmartin knew this as well as the countess for the marquis de saintsauveur and monsieur de morigny had both wrote to her before their departure from beauplan to inform her of their intended expedition and to take their leaves of her she was almost as much afflicted as the countess and was going into the country to bewail her lovers absence and to conceal the interest she took in it however she affected to be surprised at the news expressing a great esteem for the young marquis de saintsauveur had she said love she would but have done justice to those sentiments she felt for him but on such occasions young ladies generally show they can be very secret and indeed she had dissembled her thoughts with so much art that neither the marquis or monsieur de morigny had ever reason to flatter himself with being prefered to this conduct of here is was owing the dispute which terminated in their duel at fontainebleau for each supposing the other more happy than himself both were enraged and thought themselves injured  however mademoiselle de montmartin was not quite so reserved with the sister of her favorite lover for though she would not confess that she loved the marquis de saintsauveur yet she acknowledged with a graceful modesty that notwithstanding monsieur de morigny had great merit yet he would never be her choice this was enough to assure the countess who did not want penetration that one lover was rejected in favor of the other she knew her sex too well to expect a farther explanation from one so modest as mademoiselle de montmartin and sensible how obliging such an declamation was for her brother she only answered it by tender caresses to show that she understood it so  mademoiselle de montmartin was absolutely ignorant of the chevalier des essars passion for the countess as well as the great esteem she had for him they discoursed about the duel between the rivals mademoiselle de montmantin praised the valor and generosity of the chevalier in very high terms and the countess was not sorry that she had an opportunity of talking of him both of them had great obligations to him no conversation is so delightful as that on a beloved object these ladies sufficiently proved the truth of that observation for the count the chevalier and the marquis afforded them a subject so copious that although they talked of nothing else during that days journey yet when they came to part at night they seemed to have a great deal more to say the countess and mademoiselle de montmartin embraced each other tenderly and vowed an inviolable friendship madam de berci promised to be in paris at the expiration of two months from whence she did not intend to remove till her lords arrival mademoiselle de montmartin on her side assured her that she would join her there about that time and entreated her to write to her frequently promising to be as punctual as possible in her answers  the countess of berci continuing her journey arrived three days afterward at her fathers estate where she was received with the highest testimonies of joy her mother who had not seen her since her marriage held her a long time embraced in her arms bedewing her fair face with tears of tenderness and delight madame de berci as soon as these first transports of their meeting were subsided acquainted her parents with her lords and her brothers departure to holland and that it was the chevalier des essars who had persuaded them to this expedition to which she had been obliged to consent  god grant said the old marquis de saintsauveur with lifted eyes that their safe return may put an end to your fears and ours my daughter added the good old man you recall to my remembrance a man who will ever be dear to me his welfare next to that of my wife and children is what i take most interest in i dread lest his immoderate courage should expose him to dangers no human force can surmount for all that man can do he can he saved my life once by his valor and he saved it a second time by preserving your brother it will never be in my power to make him a sufficient return for benefits of this nature  the countess durst not trust herself so far as to answer this discourse of her fathers she dreaded lest she should say too much on so pleasing a subject she therefore artfully turned the conversation upon her meeting with mademoiselle de montmartin at auxerre she extolled the merit and beauty of that young lady and expressed an ardent wish that she might be so happy as to have her for a sisterinlaw the old marquis who knew her family as also that she had a very large fortune a quality which in those times as well as our own was of higher estimation than all the advantages of wit birth and beauty was extremely well satisfied with his sons taste and approved of his daughters proposal declaring that her estate was a very good one and she was a very amiable lady  in the mean time the count of berci who took every opportunity of writing to his wife and sending her news of every thing that concerned him informed her of his brothers being taken prisoner by the enemies and the extremity to which he himself and his brotherinlaw would have been reduced but for the immediate assistance they received from the chevalier des essars he acknowledged that he owed his life to the courage of that brave man and that he had also preserved the marquis de saintsauveur a second time the count gave a very circumstantial account of the danger they had been in and of the valor and conduct of his friend who by a thousand brave exploits had gained a never dying reputation he entreated his wife to be at paris in a few days where he hoped he should soon meet her  no my dear daughter said her mother transported with admiration and gratitude the count must come and fetch you write to him to bring with him this wonderful man this is the only way we have to see him he is so great a friend of your lords that he will not refuse to accompany him to burgundy we will show him by our reception of him that although it is not in our power to repay the inestimable benefits he has conferred upon us yet that we can acknowledge them with the utmost gratitude the countess could not but be very much affected with this new proof of the chevaliers passion for her her delicacy was not shocked at the grateful tenderness she felt for a man who had preserved her husband his generosity and the disinterestedness of his love seemed to authorize those favorable sentiments she had for him the praises her father and mother bestowed upon him strengthened those sentiments and it was with difficulty that she forbore joining in their eulogiums on this brave man with an ardour that might have betrayed her secret she reflected with astonishment on the strange effects of fortune which continually furnished him with new arms to take as it were her heart by force she became sensible at length that she loved the chevalier  a crime which though involuntary she would not have pardoned in herself had she not resolved to die rather than do any thing that could wound her duty or throw a blemish upon her fame  after she had continued some weeks at her fathers she had affairs to solicit at court which required that she should be there as soon as possible the marquis and his lady used a thousand efforts to detain her with a hope of having soon the company of their soninlaw and the chevalier des essars but the countess could not be prevailed upon  although the care of her affairs had indeed less part in her eagerness to be gone than her impatience to meet her lord and perhaps a secret wish to see the chevalier besides she had promised mademoiselle de montmartin to be at paris within two months and the time drew very near that young lady was already there and had wrote to the countess to remind her of her promise  madam de berci took a tender farewell of her parents who believing they saw her for the last time were dissolved in tears and grief the countess was not less afflicted and with difficulty disengaging herself from their arms she threw herself into her coach in a silent agony of grief  having met with no accidents or delays in her journey she arrived at paris on the tenth of september  she employed all the remaining part of the time her lord continued at the siege of rhineburg in soliciting the affair she had at court mademoiselle de montmartin hardly ever left her nothing could be more tender and sincere than the friendship between these two ladies mademoiselle de montmartin felt the absence of the young marquis de saintsauveur less severe when she was in the company of his charming sister and madam de berci could indulge her tenderness by talking of the chevalier des essars to mademoiselle de montmartin who considering him as the preserver of her lovers life was never tired of hearing his praises  the ladies had lodgings near the arsenal where the young nobility diverted themselves every day with tilting and other martial sports and these bloodless wars were often a pleasing amusement to them one day they were informed that some foreigners who were just arrived at paris had challenged some of the courtiers to break a lance with them as was the custom in the gallant reign of henry iv the king who supposed these foreigners to be englishmen a nation he had a high esteem for resolved to honor this combat with his presence the whole court came to the arsenal and our two friends did not fail likewise to be there the foreigners made good their challenge a long time against several lords of the court but one amongst them soon drew all the attention of the spectators he gave so many proofs of an uncommon courage and address that one of the bravest men of the court and a great favorite of the kings flattering himself that he could revenge the defeat of the other lords by overcoming his vanquisher advanced fiercely against him however he had soon cause to repent of his presumption for after several vigourous efforts to overthrow his adversary the stranger weary of a resistance to which he had not been accustomed collecting all his strength gave him so furious a blow that he fell grovelling on the ground  the courtier was slightly wounded by the lance and although the king was soon informed that his hurt was not dangerous yet he was so much concerned at an accident so mortifying for his favorite that he commanded the sports should cease and sending for the challengers desired they would make themselves known they obeyed with a profound reverence to the king and taking off their casques discovered to him that they were his own subjects  the king and the whole court soon knew them to be the same brave men who three months before had left paris to go and shut themselves up in rhineburg and indeed they were no other than the chevalier des essars and his two noble friends they had arrived that very day from holland and had agreed to signalize their entry into paris by some gallant adventure  the king was extremely pleased to see them again and was better satisfied that his favorite and his courtiers should be overcome by their own countrymen than foreigners he said a great many obliging things upon their valor and success and after conferring with them upon some particulars relating to the siege of rhineburg and declaring that he was highly pleased with their conduct he returned to the louvre and left them in the midst of the ladies  in the mean time the praises that were given to the chevalier des essars resounded from every part and had glory been the predominant passion in his soul he might have been extremely happy but he was wholly taken up with the thoughts of his lovely countess whom he was every where seeking with his eyes the impatience that was visible in his countenance and that absence of mind which made him insensible to every thing that passed had there been leisure for observation might have betrayed his secret at length he discovered the place where madam de berci was he pointed her out with a joyful emotion to the count and they immediately advanced to salute her while the marquis de saintsauveur and monsieur de morigny flew eagerly to kiss the hands of mademoiselle de montmartin who was with her that young lady was in great perplexity how to behave in such a manner to these rivals as might not excite the jealousy of either by a preference too remarkable and though her heart declared for the marquis de saintsauveur yet she received monsieur de morigny with equal appearance of satisfaction  the count of berci having embraced the countess his wife presented the chevalier des essars to her and casting a tender regard upon him said madam it is to this brave man this truly generous friend that you owe the safe return of your husband and your brother to him we are obliged for the happiness of seeing you again pay your acknowledgments here and by your grateful reception of our preserver show your estimation of the benefits he has conferred upon you  it is not the only time replied the countess sweetly blushing that the chevalier by the greatness of his services to us has made all thanks poor and infinitely below the obligations we have to him and if it is not in our power to repay such noble acts with any thing farther than such sentiments as the highest gratitude inspires he will like heaven be contented with thanks and praise since virtue is always its own greatest reward  the chevalier understood the full force of this answer which probably the count might think a little extravagant madam answered he the services i have been so happy as to render you are only considerable with respect to their motive and their objects and to which fortune has contributed more than any thing else but were they much greater than they are i should think them too well rewarded by the honor you do me of appearing sensible of them  the count during this speech had been making his compliments to mademoiselle de montmartin and the marquis de saintsauveur then found time to salute his sister and to present monsieur de morigny to her after which the count giving his hand to the young lady while the chevalier had the happiness of leading the charming countess they went altogether to madam de bercis lodgings which were but a small distance from thence  the countess detained mademoiselle de montmartin to supper as likewise some other ladies her friends who being informed of the counts return came to take part in her joy after supper several of the counts friends coming in the chevalier des essars left him amongst them and joined the ladies who had formed a little cabal by themselves the discourse now turned wholly upon gallantry one of the ladies who had a great deal of vivacity asked the chevalier if insensibility was the necessary consequence of uncommon courage and whether love and glory were incompatible to tell you the truth added she we are all very unhappy to find that our charms have yet made no impression upon your heart and since as we find by your example that heros are sensible to no other passion but ambition we are in danger of having either no adorers at all or such as will do us no honor  the countess and the chevalier could not help smiling at this speech mademoiselle de montmartin finding the chevalier silent turned to the lady who had made the attack upon him we find madam said she that the heros of old were proud of surrendering their arms to love and those laurels they had gained with such danger in the field were generally offered to some fair ones at their return why then should you imagine that the chevalier would think love a blemish to his glory when they imagined it added glory to theirs as for me i declare i believe him to be as much in love as any of those great men but infinitely more discreet and his great care to conceal his flame from all eyes but those which have kindled it is a proof with me that it is so much the more violent and lasting  mademoiselle de montmartin would not have railled the chevalier in this manner had she had the least suspicion of his passion for the countess she had no other design in it but to keep up the mirth of the conversation the countess knew not what to think when the chevalier recovering a little from the perplexity into which this discourse had thrown him said if there is no heart madam but what some time or other is sensible of the force of love mine if it had kept its freedom hitherto would certainly lose it now amidst so many charms but grant i am in love what would it avail me to confess a flame for which i cannot hope for any remedy  perhaps monsieur said mademoiselle de montmartin the beauty for whom you languish in secret wants only such a confession to make her pity and reward your love  the countess was now more alarmed than before and apprehensive that her silence might make it suspected that she was too much interested in this discourse addressed herself to the chevalier with an air so unreserved and easy as might have blinded the most penetrating view  if i was acquainted with this haughty beauty monsieur said she and was assured that i had any influence over her i would never cease to importune her till she had rendered justice to your valor and merit i am persuaded the rest of these ladies are as much inclined to favor you and would readily join their endeavors with mine to serve you if then you would make use of our assistance you must tell us the name of this powerful beauty who has had the glory to triumph over such a heart that we may all plead your cause myself particularly in acknowledgment for the services i have received from you  it was plain the countess relied greatly on the chevaliers wit and discretion or she could not have gone so far he answered her expectations and taking the word with a grace that suffered not any embarrassment to be perceived madam said he there is so great a disproportion between the merit of the lady i love and my own that i dare not hope for any return to my passion however i am so highly obliged by the offer you have generously made me and i owe you so much respect and obedience that although i had determined not to disclose her name yet if you command me i will reveal it to you upon condition that you will promise me madam never to discover the secret  it is impossible to accept of your condition interrupted the countess smiling how little do you understand our sex if you think we would not rather lose the pleasure of hearing a secret than be under the horrible restraint of keeping it but i believe continued she that we have really carried our curiosity too far  it would be inhuman to rally you any more and we will content ourselves with knowing that you are in love without desiring you to name the object  the chevalier made no reply but taking up a lute that lay upon a table he touched the strings with such art as showed he was a perfect master of that instrument and joining to it his voice he sung a melting air which expressed all the fervor of his passion the company drawn by the sweetness of his voice began to gather round him  the ladies who remarked the purport of the song which lamented a hopeless love and saw his eyes swimming in tender languishment sighing at every pause with sympathetic sorrow were persuaded that he was indeed a lover and that he was unfortunate  the countess was so affected with this musical complaint which she understood perfectly well that it was with difficulty she restrained her tears and not daring to meet her lovers eyes with so much softness in her own she turned them on her lord calling up all her virtue and her fortitude to resist the soft emotions that filled her breast the chevalier had scarce ended his song when a page entered the room and desired to speak with him he rose up and madam de berci who followed him with her eyes saw that the page delivered a message to him in a whisper after which the chevalier making an excuse to the company for leaving them followed the little emissary down stairs  the countess found something in this mysterious message sufficient to alarm her she suspected it was some lady who had sent for the chevalier that love which had lain hid even from herself at the bottom of her heart flamed out in jealousy at this incident she felt emotions which hitherto she had been a stranger to a deadly palenass overspread her face she trembled sighed and ever she was aware the tears started om her eyes such extraordinary agitasions must necessarily have awakened the companys suspicions had not the accident that happened at that very instant given a color to it by the general terror and grief with which all were seized  the chevalier having as we have already said followed the page down stairs he rushed suddenly out of the door that led to the street and three men advancing immediately to the chevalier seized him and plunged their poignards into his body the chevalier disengaging himself from their hold drew his sword to defend himself but ever he could execute his intentions he received another wound which depriving him at once of sense and motion he fell to the ground the assassins supposing him dead endeavored to escape by the door through which the page had run out and which as they expected he had left open for them but the boy in his hurry and confusion flung the door after him so that the murderers found themselves enclosed on every side the noise the chevalier had made by struggling with them reached the ears of some servants who waited in the antichamber near that the company were in they ran hastily down stairs and came just time enough to see the chevalier fall all bloody upon the ground one of them running up stairs again entered the room where the company was and told them that the chevalier des essars had just been assassinated  instantly the count of berci followed by his brother and messieurs de saintsauveur and morigny ran with their swords drawn to the hall they found their friend bathed in his own blood and lying senseless upon the ground and the three murderers who endeavored to conceal themselves standing in a corner of the hall these wretches seeing the imminent danger they were in and that they could hope for no mercy sought like madmen the count of berci called to them to yield but finding them obstinate he and his two friends soon dispatched them two of them died upon the spot and the third lived a few moments after he fell but could not be prevailed upon to declare who he was and upon what account he had joined in so villainous an action  the house was full of tumult and disorder the counts servants having taken up the chevalier carried him without reflection into the room where the ladies were they laid him on a sopha and ran to fetch surgeons  what a sad spectacle was this for the countess of berci her lover pale bloody and disfigured with wounds she stood gazing for a moment upon him her eyes seemed fixed her feet rooted to the ground then with a deep groan she fell senseless into the arms of mademoiselle de montmartin who was near her and was carried into another room where all the remedies they applied to recover her were for some time ineffectual  the surgeons in the mean time examined the chevaliers wounds they pronounced them very dangerous they conferred together a few moments in a language unintelligible to any but themselves and then proceeded to apply their dressings declaring that if the chevalier recovered it would be little less than a prodigy his friends listened to this as to the sentence of his death and abandoned themselves to excessive grief the chevalier was put to bed and continued all the rest of the night in a swoon toward the morning he began to recover his senses but his voice was so low that he could scarce be heard when he attempted to speak he had lost a great quantity of blood and with it all remembrance of what had happened to him the surgeons who visited him as soon as it was light ordered that he should not be allowed to see any person or to speak but be kept as quiet as possible his friends amidst their anxiety for his recovery used their utmost endeavors to find out the authors of so horrid a villainy after a strict enquiry they discovered the page who had brought the message to the chevalier and delivered him up to his butchers he confessed that he and those men had been employed by a kinsman of the kings favorite who had been unhorsed in the lists by the chevalier the same day he came to paris  the friends of monsieur des essars full of indignation and breathing revenge went to the louvre to complain of this assassination to the king and to demand justice on the author of it it was but too probable that the favorite himself who was likewise vanquished by the chevalier was concerned in this black affair however he disavowed it publicly and showed great concern for the condition to which the chevalier was reduced his grief whether real or affected had such marks of sincerity in it as persuaded the king he was absolutely ignorant of the horrid deed and being charmed at such a conviction of his innocence he obliged him and the friends of the chevalier to embrace in his presence commanding them positively to take no other measures to revenge him than those the law allows  in the mean time the favourites kinsman sought to secure his own safety by flight he went into another country and never more durst venture to return to france but although the favorite was justified in the kings opinion yet the public had not the same indulgence for him nor equal facility in believing his professions the chevalier had never had any declared enemy and it was the general discourse that the false shame of being vanquished had induced him to commit an action so infamous and so unworthy of a brave man  but let us now return to the unfortunate countess of berci when she had recovered her senses and began to reflect on what had passed she found she had given very remarkable testimonies of her grief and tenderness before several witnesses all of whom she could not flatter herself were so taken up with their own terror and concern as not to observe them she trembled at the interpretation her lord might put upon her behavior but the count of berci who tenderly loved his wife and who had not the least suspicion of her virtue attributed her sudden fainting to the terrors with which she was seized at the sight of the chevalier in that dreadful condition and it was natural for her to be extremely afflicted for the danger of one from whom she had received so many services  he was the first to tell her that the surgeons had some hopes of his recovery she was overjoyed at this news but the apprehensions she still continued to be under that her regard for the chevalier was discovered embittered that joy and filled her with anxiety she dreaded lest her brotherinlaw should form suspicions injurious to her virtue he indeed was but too well acquainted with the chevaliers passion for the countess and did not fail to observe the conduct of them both his sisterinlaws fainting did not escape his notice but whatever were his thoughts about it he kept them shut up in his heart and never took any step that might give her uneasiness or prejudice her in the opinion of her husband and notwithstanding his secret envy of the chevalier he always governed himself by those principles of generosity which were natural to him  as soon as the chevalier was able to reflect upon the adventure which had happened to him he employed his mind incessantly in considering who could be the author of it and as lovers are ever torturing themselves with imaginary evils he sometimes fancied that this secret enemy who sought to take his life by such shameful methods was a rival who flattered himself that it was he only who stood in his way to happiness this thought gave him inexpressible agonies he burnt with desire to be revenged and impatience and the inquietude of his mind greatly retarded his recovery  the count of berci who came into his chamber one day when he was most disturbed with these chimeras finding his fever much higher and hearing him sigh and discover great agitation of mind what is it that troubles you my dear chevalier said this tender and faithful friend why do you give way to any anxious thoughts in the condition you are in the melancholy that oppresses you will be of dangerous consequence to your health and the hopes the surgeons have given us of your life will be all blasted if you do not by calming your mind contribute to your cure banish these cares that disturb your own quiet and afflict your friends and be assured that you are already revenged of your enemies if that thought can give you any relief  the count then informed him of the fate of his three assassins but took care not to own his suspicions concerning the kings favorite whom he had vanquished in the lists the day he arrived at paris he was afraid that he would too soon be led by common discourse and his own reflections to suspect him himself and knowing the courage of his friend he did not doubt but as soon as he had recovered his strength he would take vengeance on him for the base attempt he had made upon his life  the chevalier would have answered the count and expressed his acknowledgment of the friendship he discovered for him but monsieur de berci laying his hand upon his mouth conjured him to obey the surgeons directions who had earnestly recommended to him not to speak and tenderly urged him to contribute all in his power toward his cure which was earnestly prayed for by his friends the chevalier then contented himself with pressing in an affectionate manner the counts hand which he held between his endeavoring by this action to show him how greatly he was affected with all those instances he gave him of his friendship he ardently wished to see the countess  her presence would have been an effectual relief to him but she was of a contrary opinion she was afraid that the sight of her might produce some dangerous alteration she therefore contented herself with sending frequent messages to know the state of his health and to assure him of the great interest she took in it  at the expiration of fifteen days the surgeons declared that he was out of danger and that they would answer for his life the count eager to communicate this good news to his wife went instantly to her apartment and congratulated his brother and her upon the hopedfor recovery of a friend so dear to them all madam de berci could resist no longer the earnest desire she had to see him but still fearful of surprising him she sent to let him know that she would visit him the next day this interval appeared an age to the transported chevalier he counted the hours with impatience and blessed every fleeting moment as it past which brought him nearer to his happiness  the marquis de saintsauveur and mademoiselle de montmartin accompanied the countess in this visit but they glad of an opportunity to discourse together apart retired to one end of the room as soon as they had paid their compliments to the chevalier and left the countess alone at his bedside the chevalier at the sight of her whom he loved with such ardency forgot his wounds and his pain he attempted to raise himself in his bed that he might in a less unbecoming posture thank her for the honor she did him madam de berci perceiving his intention made a motion with her hand to hinder him the happy chevalier immediately seized that charming hand and the countess not having resolution enough to withdraw it at first he printed an ardent kiss upon it but again offering to press it to his lips she drew it back with precipitation though with no marks of anger and this mute conversation gave place to acknowledgements on the part of the chevalier and protestations of eternal gratitude and respect for her unmerited goodness but all uttered with such apparent disorder and in language so unconnected as persuaded the countess of the fervor of his love better than the most eloquent discourse could have done she assured him on her side that she had been really afflicted at the misfortune which had happened to him she entreated him to take care of himself and not retard his cure by any impatience or anxiety she said a thousand obliging things to him and although she was a little offended at the freedom he had used in taking her hand so unexpectedly yet she would not in the weak condition he was in discover any resentment toward him but secretly resolved to avoid as much as possible all opportunities of being alone with him lest a less pardonable liberty should escape him and fearing he would endanger his health by speaking too much if she protracted her visit any longer she oe from her chair and mademoiselle de montmartin and her lover approaching she took leave of him promising to see him soon again she kept her word and visited him frequently but took care to be as seldom as possible left alone at his bedside her presence advanced his cure more than all the surgeons endeavors he felt no pain when he saw her and even the torments of his mind were suspended while she was with him he ound so much sweetness in that soft and obliging solicitude she expressed for his recovery that he began to dread lest his wound should be cured too soon  would to heaven madam said he to her one day when she asked him how he was that i might continue still for years in this condition the highest health has not half so many charms for me as these wounds since they procure me the blessing of seeing you and of being assured that you take some interest in my health  although he spoke these words very low so that they could only be heard by the countess the rest of the company who came with her to visit standing at some distance in discourse yet she blushed and was in great confusion you make an ill use of my condescension said she softly in answer and you will force me to forbear my visits unless you treat me with more respect these words were severe enough to have given the chevalier great pain for nothing is so timid as a true lover but a smile which immediately after beamed over the fair face of madam de berci and a parting look she gave him which expressed more compassion than anger calmed his fears and notwithstanding his wishes to the contrary his cure was soon perfected and he obliged through decency to quit the count of bercis house and remove to his own  he now thought himself in a frightful solitude absence increased his despair without diminishing his love he had been so used to the sight of the charming countess every day that he could not live without it when the hour approached in which she and her friends used to visit him he felt more sensibly the want of that charming presence which while enjoyed annihilated his torments he sought for relief in company and amusements but in crowds he was alone and in the midst of pleasures absorbed in melancholy  love pursued him every where but a love without hope and reason which he sometimes called to his aid when it represented to him that his pursuit was fruitless increased his despair but left his passion more violent than before  nor was the countess without her inquietudes her tenderness for the chevalier though innocent was a perpetual reproach to her in her own mind reason and duty dictated to her that she ought to combat such thoughts as seemed to incroach upon the love she owed her husband while on the other hand the services she had received from the chevalier demanded her gratitude his unhappy love excited her compassion and his merit forced her esteem fain would she have persuaded herself that the sentiments she had for him were authorized by the obligations he had conferred on her whole family but her heart was pure and the voice of reason though not heard amidst the tumult of unrestrained and lawless passions yet is readily listened to by doubting virtue hence it followed that the countess escaped all those snares which the deluding sophistry of love laid for her and although she could not vanquish her tenderness for the chevalier yet looking upon it as a crime she lived in continual war with herself and kept her will in subjection if she could not her thoughts the conversation of mademoiselle de montmartin as it was tender and sensible and her heart sincere was all the comfort madam de berci had but this lady was likewise far from being happy  the marquis de saintsauveur and monsieur de morigny still continued their addresses to her their jealousy notwithstanding their endeavors to conceal it as well from her as from each other broke out in all their looks and actions she dreaded the effects of it she loved the marquis and she felt nothing but indifference for monsieur de morigny nevertheless she was obliged to conceal her real sentiments and treat them with equal reserve  it is extremely difficult to act always in opposition to our inclinations and to a mind naturally sincere and artless all dissimulation is painful mademoiselle de montmartin suffered great uneasiness from the continual restraint she laid upon herself but she trembled lest she should be the cause of a second rupture between these friendly rivals they haunted her perpetually they visited her together they followed her to all public places and if to get rid of the importunity of monsieur de morigny she sometimes refused to see him it was necessary likewise that she should deprive herself of the pleasure of seeing her beloved marquis whose destiny by the peculiar unhappiness of her situation was not more fortunate than that of his rival it is true she might have freed herself from so cruel a tyranny by declaring at once her choice but terrified at what had lately happened she trembled lest the rivals should again dispute the possession of her with their swords and the loss of her beloved marquis would then be unavoidable for if he did not perish by his rivals hand he could not a second time hope for a pardon she resolved therefore to see neither of them till time had produced some alteration in their minds and absence from the marquis seemed less painful to endure than the cruel alternative of treating both with equal indifference where one was so greatly preferred  having taken her resolution she told them when they came as usual to visit her that for very important reasons which she could not at that time explain to them she must desire they would forbear their visits  the lovers thunderstruck at so severe a decree gazed on her some moments in silence the marquis at length recovering from his first consternation began to expostulate with her upon the cruelty of her proceeding mademoiselle de montmartin was greatly affected scarce could she restrain her tears and some sighs in spite of her made their way as she spoke to her lover to whom she confirmed though with a faltering voice his sentence her emotion did not escape his observation it gave rise to various reflections in his mind he turned from her and went to a window where he stood ruminating upon what had passed  in the mean time monsieur de morigny who had been so shocked with her cruel prohibition that he had not been able to attend to what she said to his rival began to urge her with the most vehement entreaties to change her resolution mademoiselle de montmartin found no reluctance in herself to deny him she assured him with great steadiness that she had taken it upon mature deliberation and that nothing he could say would have power to alter it the marquis approaching her as she pronounced these words told her that he would give her a convincing proof of his passion by paying an implicit obedience to her commands he bowed low as he finished these words which monsieur de morigny looking upon as the signal for going away only conjured her not to make the time of their banishment too long since it would be difficult for them to obey her and live and then taking a respectful leave he followed the marquis de saintsauveur and they both went out of the house together  the chevalier des essars saw them and perceiving an unusual discomposure on their countenances asked them the reason of it they acquainted him with what had happened and entreated him to advise them how to act in such a perplexing situation  the chevalier very frankly told them it was their part to obey he represented to them that the extremities to which their jealousy had formerly carried them was without doubt the cause which had induced mademoiselle de montmartin to banish them from her presence and that it was that very jealousy the effects of which she dreaded now which had made them commit a fault that to repeat would render them wholly inexcusable and at the same time that it deprived them of the esteem of their mistress would infallibly draw upon them the anger of their prince who would not be again prevailed upon to pardon them he added that if they truly loved mademoiselle de montmartin they would leave her to the freedom of making her choice and not expose her to the hatred of the public by making her the subject of new quarrels and more bloodshed and lastly he conjured them to remember their old friendship which they had so lately renewed with mutual oaths and not to resign themselves to the wild rage of jealousy which had already produced such dreadful effects  they both assured him that although they could not renounce their love for mademoiselle de montmartin yet they would obey her orders whatever it cost them the chevalier then obliging them to promise that neither of them would take any measures to produce an alteration in the mind of mademoiselle de montmartin without acquainting each other they parted with a full resolution to keep their word  accordingly for some days they religiously observed the promise by which they had bound themselves they were equally afraid of offending their mistress and of giving each other any occasion of disgust they flattered themselves that in the variety of amusements which are to be found in paris they should meet with some aleviation of their grief but the dissipation in which they lived could not banish the idea of mademoiselle de montmartin from their thoughts all objects became disagreeable but that which they were forbidden to behold and which was nevertheless always present to their imaginations  monsieur de morigny less politic or more impatient than the marquis de saintsauveur was the first who resolved to get rid of this tormenting restraint he hired an apartment opposite to the house where mademoiselle de montmartin lived believing it would be some relief to him to be in a place where he might sometimes behold her at a window or see her get in and out of her coach he did not reflect upon the consequences of this rash step and falsely imagined that there was nothing in it contrary to the obedience he had vowed to pay to the orders of his mistress nor to the promise he had made to his rival  the marquis de saintsauveur who had placed spies upon monsieur de morigny which gave him an exact information of his conduct soon learned by one of them that his rival was never to be found in his own house nor seen in any place of public diversion but spent all his hours in an apartment opposite to the house of the lady they both loved which he had hired for the convenience of seeing her the marquis easily saw that monsieur de morigny had no intention to forget her and thinking himself dispensed with from keeping his word with a man who had first broke through his engagements he resolved to derive some advantages from this breach of faith in his rival and endeavor to prevail upon mademoiselle de montmartin to repeal his banishment being informed the next day that mademoiselle de montmartin was gone to the thuilleries with another lady he ordered his coach in an instant and drove thither determined to complain to her of monsieur de morignys ungenerous behavior and entreat her to do him justice he found it was the countess of berci his sister who was with her which gave him more courage to approach her after having paid his compliments to her with great respect he entreated her not to condemn him till she had heard him he told her it was true that by coming into her presence contrary to her express prohibition he appeared a rebel to her orders but he had such reasons to urge in his excuse as would he hoped justify him in her opinion he then informed her of what monsieur de morigny had done he represented to her that it was not just his rival should every hour enjoy the pleasure of seeing her while he languished in a cruel banishment he hinted that if she did not admit the justice of his plea he should have room to suspect that monsieur de morigny was more favored than himself and perceiving that this insinuation gave her some emotion he pursued it with such art and painted the torments he endured during the absence she had condemned him to in colors so lively that mademoiselle de montmartin was moved she looked upon monsieur de morignys behavior as an instance of disrespect to her and as a breach of honor to his friend she thought herself affronted by his taking an apartment so near her and as one is easily persuaded of the guilt of those whom one dislikes monsieur de morignys conduct however innocent in itself to her prejudiced mind appeared a crime worthy of her utmost rigor nothing could have happened more agreeable to her inclinations she loved the marquis de saintsauveur and wanted a specious pretense for recalling him she had now found such an occasion as she had wished for the absent lover was treated as a presumptuous man who had disobeyed her orders and was therefore condemned to perpetual banishment while the happy marquis was listened to favorably his complaints acknowledged to be just and the means he pursued to procure satisfaction lawful it is not difficult to find favor with a partial judge the marquis de saintsauveur soon gained his cause before this tribunal at the expense of the unfortunate de morigny  the countess of berci joined in her brothers request that he might be permitted to see her mademoiselle de montmartin at last consented to receive his visits but with great caution she flattered herself that their meetings might be carried on so privately that monsieur de morigny notwithstanding he was so near a neighbor might not be informed of them it was agreed that the marquis should never come to her house till it was night she was assured that his passion was honorable and having the sanction of his sisters concurrence to these private interviews they thought there was nothing to apprehend on the score of scandal  mademoiselle de montmartin used to retire early to her apartment and when her servants were in bed her woman who was well paid by the marquis for her secresy always introduced him into the house where he generally staid an hour or two with his mistress for some time these happy lovers continued undisturbed in the possession of that liberty they had so long wished for of seeing and declaring to each other their mutual tenderness but it is a difficult thing to deceive a jealous man long he is the argos of the fable his hundred eyes are continually open and no charms are able to close one of them for a moment  it happened that the marquis coming one morning at three oclock out of the house of mademoiselle de montmartin that young lady that she might have the pleasure of seeing him a moment longer looked out of the window after her lover who was then in the street the moon shone bright and the unhappy de morigny who was too much in love to sleep soundly hearing some little noise in the street ran to his window and softly opening it he had the mortification to see his rival taking leave of his mistress with expressions which showed he was in a situation very different from his and to hear mademoiselle de montmartin answer him with great tenderness but as if this was not enough to torment the unfortunate morigny and that nothing should be wanting to complete his despair the marquis took it into his head to entreat mademoiselle de montmartin to throw him some trifle out of the window that he might have the pleasure to have something in his possession that night which belonged to her  mademoiselle de montmartin refused to grant this request at first and turned it into ridicule but the marquis pressed her so earnestly that at last she tossed him a white handkerchief she had in her hand however it was less in compliance with what she thought a silly request than her desire to get him away least by staying longer in the street some unlucky chance might discover him to his rival the marquis catched the handkerchief she threw him and kissing it made a profound bow to his mistress wishing her as happy as he should be that night with such a favor in his possession and then departed  monsieur de morigny heard and saw all that past rage and despair had almost deprived him of his senses he was several times upon the point to rush out upon his happy rival and sacrifice him to his just revenge before the eyes of his mistress and by one last combat decide the fate of his life and love but he was withheld almost in spite of himself by his eager desire to see and hear all but when he saw the marquis go away he cursed his imprudence and his folly for suffering him to escape without taking a severe revenge upon him for the injury he had done him he then comforted himself with the thought of demanding satisfaction of his false friend the next day and threw himself upon his bed full of the hoped for vengeance but when this first fury gave way to calmer reflections he found that he was miserable that he had nothing to hope for from mademoiselle de montmartin and that the marquis de saintsauveur was beloved grief now took the place of fury and a thirst of vengeance he could not think of losing mademoiselle de montmartin for ever without agonies not to be described he gave way a while to these first transports of despair and death seemed to be his only resource but the mind amidst the most violent pangs of sorrow naturally turns itself toward any possibility of relief he began to reflect upon the extreme indifference mademoiselle de montmartin had always shown him he blamed himself for entertaining hopes unjustly founded and concluded that if he had not blinded himself by those intoxicating expectations his passion would not have gained such strength he considered whether an attempt to subdue it might not still be successful and if the despair to which he was reduced might not by a proper exertion of his reason be productive of his cure the first fruit of these thoughts was a salutary shame for his own weakness he blushed for having given way to transports unworthy of a man of sense and courage the marquiss behavior seemed now not quite so unjustifiable as he had at first conceived it to be since he was capable of acknowledging to himself that he had deserved such an advantage should be taken of him by breaking his word to him solemnly given in presence of the chevalier des essars not to take any measures to see mademoiselle de montmartin her behavior to the marquis showed that she had always loved him and convinced him that his own addresses had been always disagreeable to her and that any farther pursuit would not only be fruitless but add to his rivals triumph and his own disgrace  what signifies my sighs said he to himself they are despised while my rivals are heard with a tender sympathy and while i pass my nights in misery and complaints he is happy in the sight and conversation of his mistress who uses no precaution in those testimonies she gives him of her love is it not more consistent with my honor and my quiet to sacrifice a passion so odious and despised to reason and to friendship than prosecute an unjust revenge and solicit a hopeless love can i expect to snatch her heart by violence the marquis and she are united by the most tender ties will my rage and my complaints break them were it in my power to render them miserable should i be more happy or rather should i not be far more wretched by the consciousness of the injury i did them  monsieur de morigny found tranquillity steal upon his soul as he pursued these reflections his passion lost its force in proportion as he exercised his reason and he resolved at length to renounce those hopes which had hitherto made up all his happiness and conquer that passion which was always his misfortune and would now under such convictions be his crime  a change so sudden although not frequent is nevertheless not impossible and would be oftener effected if the still voice of reason be listened to the base subjection we live in to our own desires is the effect of our pusillanimity we need only to fight to be acquainted with our strength if love so often engages us with success it is because we find him arms against ourselves and he is strong only in our weakness love is an enemy whom it is no disgrace to shun against him flight is victory his first approaches are always dangerous distance only can secure our safety and make our triumph glorious  monsieur de morigny was convinced of this truth he took care not to expose himself again to the danger of seeing mademoiselle de montmartin he knew his own weakness and her power he was persuaded that all the wise resolutions he had taken would vanish in her presence he therefore returned to his own house and avoided company and public places as much as possible that he might have no opportunity of seeing or bearing of that fatal beauty whom it was now his business to forget monsieur de morigny had always a pious turn disappointments in worldly affairs have often contributed greatly toward making a devout christian he applied himself to religious books for consolation in his misfortunes in this study he found not only what he sought resignation and peace but they also inspired him with a zeal suitable to his years and condition an active zeal which laid the foundation of a design to which the brightest actions of his life were owing he resolved to consecrate his future days to the service of religion by fighting against its most redoutable enemy who by his own strength and the vast extent of dominion which he had usurped was still less dreadful to christendom than by the disunion and different interests of christian princes the barbarous othoman infested at that time the seas by his pirates the most inhuman outrages were every day committed by them with impunity the cities of algiers and tunis were filled with the unhappy victims of their cruelty and rapine who groaned in chains and languished out their lives in the utmost misery  monsieur de morigny felt a generous compassion for these unhappy sufferers he was desirous of associating himself with those brave and pious knights who bound themselves by solemn vows to consecrate their labors to the service of religion and who swore upon the altar an eternal hatred to the infidels and to maintain a continual war against them the order of the religious of saint john of jerusalem was then a nursery fruitful in great men and valiant warriors an end so noble and a vocation so eminent were conformable to the martial inclinations of monsieur de morigny his zeal increased every day and he resolved not to defer any longer his entrance into that order which was both a military and religious one he prepared therefore for a speedy departure for malta in order to take the cross and having settled his affairs he reserved only a small pension for himself destining all the rest of his estate which was very large to the redemption of christian slaves as the noblest use he could make of his riches  when all was finished he sent invitations to his friends to require they would meet at his house he then in few words acquainted them with his design which he was ready to put into execution immediately and addressing himself particularly to the marquis de saintsauveur  i render thanks to heaven said he for having conducted me safely to a happy port from whence i may contemplate securely the shipwrecks of love may you my dear marquis be happy with mademoiselle de montmartin i no longer envy your good fortune you are more worthy of her than i am i have now ceased to be your rival but shall always be your friend  this speech greatly moved the marquis de saintsauveur and the chevalier des essars they made some efforts to retain him in paris and to prevail upon him to quit a resolution which they attributed to despair but he steadily resisted all their entreaties and having tenderly embraced them he took leave of them and after a prosperous voyage arrived safely af malta he performed his caravanes for so they call the first sea expeditions of the new knights of malta in which he gave to the new order he had embraced and to all christendom several glorious testimonies of his zeal and of his valor against the common enemy  mademoiselle de montmartin could not hear of his departure without being moved and gave some tears to the memory of a man who by her rigor had been forced to embrace a life so dangerous and austere nothing now seemed to oppose the good fortune of the marquis de saintsauveur he had wholly resigned himself to the most flattering hopes when that young lady by a conduct as capricious as it was cruel forbid him all on a sudden to visit her  the marquis in the utmost uneasiness and surprise at such an unexpected stroke used every argument that love could suggest to prevail upon her to revoke so unjust and cruel a command but all was in vain he was forced to submit and such was his submission to her will that although in his heart he could not but condemn the fair tyrant for her unreasonable conduct yet he did not complain nor make any attempts to break a chain which she was resolved to render so heavy  mean time the chevalier des essars being perfectly recovered of his wounds made frequent visits to the count of berci still fancying that the sight of his lovely mistress would alleviate his pains while in reality that sight only strengthened his disease when chance afforded him an opportunity of speaking to her in private the violence of his passion would sometimes force him to make complaints of her rigor and his own unhappiness but these complaints always drew upon him severe reproaches from the countess whose only consolation it was amidst the uneasiness in which she was plunged that she religiously adhered to the duty she owed her lord  are you not she would say the most unjust man in the world when you accuse me of ingratitude and cruelty how can i listen to you without being cruel to myself and without being ungrateful and base to a husband who loves me with the tenderest affection ah monsieur you lose all the glory of the great benefits i have received from you by expecting a reward which my duty forbids me to give if you have saved the lives of my father my husband and my brother is it just that i should load them with infamy and dishonor myself in return for those obligations do not imagne that all your services can make me think myself authorized to grant you favors inconsistent with the fidelity i owe my lord alas my own conscience condemns me for having heard the declarations you have made me but much more for being too sensible of your misfortune in loving me hope not in spite of this confession of my weakness to triumph over me my virtue and my duty will always furnish me with arms against you make then a generous effort yourself and restrain your passion within such bounds that you may not for the future indulge a wish which may alarm my virtue and make me blush for my own weakness if not for my guilt  the chevalier could not help acknowledging the reasonableness of her arguments and these conversations always ended by repentance on his side and new assurances of never offending her with such presumptuous complaints for the future  but he did not long enjoy the happiness of seeing his mistress and declaring to her the excess of his passion new misfortunes tore him soon after from the presence of her who was so dear to him and then it was that a fatal experience showed him that a hopeless absence was a torment greater than any he had yet felt  in effect whatever precautions his friends used to prevent his entertaining any suspicions of the person who had attempted to get him assassinated he was at length brought to his knowledge and at a time when he had lost all remembrance of the injury as well as the desire of revenge  one of those busy sycophants who swarm in courts meeting the chevalier one day told him with great appearance of friendship and regard for his honor that the public were astonished at the patience with which he bore the injury offered him by the count of polan for so i shall call the kings favorite who was indeed the real author of that detestable attempt to assassinate the chevalier des essars he added that although he was convinced it was owing to his generosity and greatness of soul that he did not take a revenge suitable to the wrong that had been done him yet that the court judged otherwise and attributed the extreme indifference he showed in an affair which so nearly concerned his honor to his fear of offending the king whose fondness for the count was well known but that no consideration whatever ought to oblige him to pass over quietly such a glaring injury and that it was necessary he should take some resolution immediately to silence reports so injurious to his reputation  the chevalier des essars who at first could not comprehend what the man meant by talking to him of the count of polan and the revenge it was expected he should take of him made him repeat what he had said the busy courtier then gave him a long account of all what had passed he exaggerated many circumstances and added many more and finally assured him that it was the count of polan who had employed assassins to murder him in revenge for having defeated him in the tournament  the chevalier had wisdom and discretion he was not willing to be precipitated into an affair of such consequence and was resolved before he proceeded any farther to examine into it more carefully he went immediately to the house of monsieur de berci and taking him aside reproached him for his secresy and reserve which had had consequences that could not but be prejudicial to his character he then recounted to him all that he had just heard and conjured him earnestly to tell him all he knew without disguise or palliation  the count of berci was thrown into great perplexity by this demand he endeavored to remove his suspicions of the count of polan but he could not deny that the public had the same the chevalier persuaded that they were but too well founded both by the flight of the count of polans kinsman with whom he never had any quarrel and likewise by the favourites cool behavior toward him which argued a secret disgust resolved to be revenged but in the mean time he carefully concealed his intentions and seeming to be quite convinced that the informations he had received were false the count of berci thought the affair entirely over and did not apprehend any fatal consequence from his resentment but he was mistaken the chevalier under the appearance of great composure breathed nothing but fury and revenge nevertheless the resolution he had taken to challenge the count of polan occasioned some disagreeable reflections whatever way it was terminated he was sure to lose the sight of his beloved countess and draw upon himself the anger of his king who would consider him as doubly criminal by transgressing the law against duelling for which he had once been pardoned and by outraging him in the person of a man whom he greatly esteemed but the chevalier eager for revenge could neither be influenced by the voice of love or ambition as soon as he returned home he wrote the following billet to the count of polan charging his gentleman whom he sent with it to deliver it into the counts own hand  the chevalier des essars to the count of polan if the king influenced by his great affection for you and his own generosity has been prevailed upon to acquit you in his own thoughts of the base attempt which was lately made upon my life yet my just suspicions and those of the public are not yet effaced the flight of your kinsman is a sufficient proof that he acted by your orders and leaves me no other part to take but to address myself to you to demand satisfaction for the injury i have received from your emissaries the person who brings you this will tell you the place where you are expected alone by   the chevalier des essars   the count of polan was still in bed when the chevaliers gentleman desired admittance to him he was told that the count was not up but he entreated that he might be waked immediately because he had an affair to communicate to him of the utmost consequence the counts servant being thus pressed informed his master immediately who ordered the gentleman to be admitted and receiving the billet he brought read it in his bed without betraying the least emotion then desiring the chevaliers gentleman to wait a moment he took a pen and wrote this answer  the count of polan to the chevalier des essars you prevent me in the demand you have made and without entering here into any explanation concerning the injury you complain of know that i only waited for the reestablishment of your health to prove if you are as fortunate with the sword as you have been with the lance be in the appointed place at the hour you mention and depend upon seeing immediately with an ardor equal to your own   the count of polan   the chevaliers gentleman having delivered this answer to his master who felt a new accession to his fury he mounted his horse and attended only by his gentleman rode instantly to the back of le bois de boulogne where he had soon the satisfaction to see his adversary arrive followed only by his gentleman likewise they both dismounted immediately the two gentlemen received their horses and were spectators of a long and obstinate combat the count and the chevalier stripped themselves to their shirts as was the custom at that time and with a gloomy silence and eyes sparkling with fury rushed upon each other for above a quarter of an hour they fought with equal ardor and equal success the chevalier des essars by so long a resistance found that he had to do with one of the most valiant men in the world he had never before met with an enemy worthy of his courage and strength fortune always favorable to him would not abandon him on an occasion so pressing the count stumbling over a stone that lay in his way was put into some disorder the chevalier closing with him instantly gave him a mortal wound he fell to the earth and a few moments afterward expired in the arms of his gentleman  the chevalier des essars mounted his horse the moment he saw his antagonist fall and rode to paris with the utmost haste that he might get there before the counts death could be known he alighted at his own house and after he had taken what money he thought he should have occasion for he went immediately to that of the count of berci he related to him in brief what had happened and his design of retiring immediately into flanders the count of berci opposed this scheme and advised him to go immediately to an estate which he had in the heart of anjou where it was not probable he would be searched for he assured him he might remain there in security till the king informed of the justice of his cause and the reasonableness of his resentment might be prevailed on to grant him a pardon the chevalier approving of this expedient the count wrote a letter to the steward of his castle in which he commanded him to accommodate the chevalier in the best manner he could and charged him upon pain of losing his place not to discover to any one that he was concealed there  the chevalier embraced his dear count with the utmost tenderness and thanked him for his friendly solicitude for his safety he left in his hands a copy of his letter to the count of polan with that unhappy noblemans answer to it that they might if necessary be shown to the king he then recommended to him the care of his private affairs in paris and took leave of him with another ardent embrace the countess advancing to bid him farewell he could only by his eyes and a heart breaking sigh as he kissed her hand express the grief he felt at being thus torn from her madam de berci saw his emotion and after she had with a faltering voice wished him health and safety she retired to her chamber to give free vent to her tears  mean time the count of polans gentleman having dispatched a man who accidentally passed by to paris for a coach he placed the body of his lord in it and carried him thither the whole court was soon informed of the counts death but very few persons were concerned for it as it was not doubted but he was the contriver of the chevalier des essars designed assassination on the contrary the brave revenge which the chevalier had taken was highly approved and the more as he was entitled by the counts baseness toward him to have attempted his life without endangering his own but the king who had loved the count with great tenderness and who had never entertained the slightest suspicion of his guilt was excessively enraged against the chevalier des essars he ordered the most diligent search to be made for him and protested his life should pay the forfeit due to his violated laws  the countess of berci was greatly afflicted at this inflexibility of the kings she foresaw that the unhappy chevalier would be obliged to undergo a long and perhaps perpetual banishment from his native country her compassion for the sad fate of a man who so well deserved to be happy augmented her tenderness and her mind as if it had a foreboding of her approaching misfortunes fell insensibly into a melancholy that made all company and diversions irksome to her mademoiselle de montmartin was the only person she saw with pleasure their friendship continued always tender and sincere notwithstanding the countess would sometimes reproach her with her rigor to the marquis de saintsauveur her brother at a time when nothing seemed to oppose his happiness  mademoiselle de montmartin in excuse for herself alleged that the noise monsieur morignys resolution had made gave occasion for very free discourses upon her conduct and had determined her to act in the manner she had done by the marquis she added that if her brother truly loved her he would not be discouraged by a reserve which was but in appearance cruel and which in her situation was absolutely necessary that the marquis could not but be sensible of her regard for him and that his perseverance would convince her of the sincerity and ardor of his passion  the countess was forced to yield to these specious reasons she repeated to her brother what mademoiselle de montmartin had said and consoled him under the prohibition she had laid upon him by assurances that it would not be long before she made him happy these two lovely friends lived from that time in the most perfect union although the countess and she did not mix with the great world their manner of life had not fewer charms for them reading walking and sometimes the theater agreeably varied their amusements and in these they found more true pleasure than in brilliant and numerous circles of which they were formed to be very distinguishing ornaments the count of berci always made one in their parties the tenderness which the countess his wife felt for the chevalier des essars having nothing criminal in it it did not lessen the affection she had for the count the presence of a husband deservedly beloved always gave her delight because she had no cause to blush for her own conduct with respect to him but this calm in the countesss fortunes did not last long she was destined to prove still greater miseries than that of hopeless love  her unhappiness was first begun by the irregular conduct of marianne her favorite woman who shared all the secrets of her heart and who as has been related before introduced the chevalier des essars into her apartment at beauplan this girl was far from imitating the virtuous examples set her by her lady she conceived a violent passion for a young gentleman named verague who was intimately acquainted with monsieur de berci the counts brother the countess although not naturally suspicious yet soon discovered this misplaced love which could not but be productive of dishonor to her woman if not timely suppressed but she saw with pain that marianne was so far from endeavoring to conquer her inclinations in favor of monsieur verague that she gave full scope to them and was not even at the pains to conceal them from her  the advances this indiscrete girl made to verague soon attracted his notice she was young and handsome he pursued his conquest and a regular intrigue commenced between them the countess often surprised them together at very undue hours she expostulated with her woman upon the danger to which she exposed her virtue by permitting the addresses of one too much her superior to give her hopes of being his wife marianne was so far from profiting by the prudent remonstrances of her lady that her passion seemed to gather strength from the obstacles which opposed it she was no longer solicitous to conceal her commerce with verague from her lady she threw aside all caution and admitted him into her chamber at all hours without the least reserve  the countess was in great affliction at this scandalous behavior she contented herself at first with reproving her for it in her usual gentle manner but she did not dare to exert the authority of a mistress that has nothing to apprehend from a servants resentment she had unfortunately confided to this girl her affection for the chevalier des essars and however irreproachable her conduct with respect to him might be yet she was apprehensive that if she drove her to extremity she might prejudice her brotherinlaw against her whose suspicions would soon infect her lord likewise the countesss case was not absolutely singular and it ought to warn the gentle sex to be cautious how they make confidents of their domestics and to make those who are unhappy enough to have intrigues tremble at the danger to which they expose themselves by accepting of their assistance  marianne insolent upon her being the depository of her ladys secret and fancying herself in full security soon threw off the masque entirely reserve and constraint suited not with that taste of libertinism which she had imbibed and she carried her immodesty to such excess that verague was almost every night brought into her chamber when her lady was retired into her apartment and they seldom parted till the next morning the countess lost all patience at such infamous behavior her whole soul was filled with a just indignation and left no room for prudential considerations she became all on a sudden intrepid to the last degree and was resolved at the hazard of whatever might happen to turn the vile marianne out of her family and gave her but three days to procure another establishment  but this girl full of grief for being dismissed on an occasion so shameful for her for she did not doubt but her lady would disclose her reasons for acting in the manner she did by her and still more afflicted that she should be deprived of the opportunities she had hitherto enjoyed of seeing her lover used her utmost endeavors to prevent her being obliged to leave her service but finding her lady firmly resolved to dismiss her she instantly conceived the blackest and most detestable project that a wicked woman could be capable of this was to prevent the effects of the countesss indignation and accuse her of unchastity and disloyalty to her lord  when her imagination had presented her with this diabolical scheme she endeavored to strengthen herself in her resolution to ruin her lady and to stifle all remorse and having settled her plan she threw herself in young bercis way and earnestly entreated him to give her a few moments audience in his own apartment  monsieur de berci surprised at her request but more at the seeming emotion with which it was made desired her to attend him immediately as soon as they had entered his chamber marianne burst into tears he eagerly asked her the cause of her affliction she first answered only by sighs and a feigned confusion which stimulated his curiosity and made him repeatedly urge his request  at length with interrupting sobs she told him that her lady had with the utmost cruelty and injustice dismissed her from her service  monsieur de berci finding this was all replied calmly that his sisterinlaw would not have acted thus without some cause that if she would confess her fault ingenuously he would engage to make her peace with her lady marianne smiled scornfully at that promise and shaking her head gave him to understand that the thing was impossible monsieur de berci a little alarmed and anxious to know more gave her his word that if she would disclose the reasons which had induced her lady to dismiss her he would not only keep her secret faithfully but use his utmost endeavors to serve her  the perfidious and wicked marianne having already settled in her thoughts what she should say began in this manner  i am extremely concerned monsieur at the necessity i am under to unfold a mystery to you which will equally surprise and grieve you but i am still more afflicted at the part i have unwillingly acted in it i conjure you to believe that if i break the silence i have so long held it is only to prove my penitence and my submission and in full reliance upon the promise you have given me that the secret shall never escape you i have been long tortured with the stings of my own conscience for the treachery i have been forced to be guilty of to my lord by serving his lady in a criminal passion which you are not wholly unacquainted with yourself but it is time that i should restore peace and tranquillity to my mind so long distracted with remorse and which my lady by her imprudent rage against me has made it necessary i should discover to clear my own innocence  know then monsieur pursued this monster that the same day which made my lady acquainted with the passion of the chevalier des essars for her whose complaints in the forest of beauplan you heard as well as she gave rise to a flame in her heart for him the alarm some nights afterward in the castle supposed to be occasioned by an attempt of some thieves to ro it was wholly owing to my ladys imprudence in admitting the chevalier privately into her apartment unhappy that i am in the recollection it was i who introduced him but i durst not withstand her peremptory orders i did all that a servant could do in such a case i represented to her respectfully the dangers to which she exposed herself and she had soon reason to be convinced that i had not exaggerated them the count your brother coming unexpectedly into my ladys chamber the chevalier was obliged to conceal himself behind the tapistry and it was wonderful that he was not seen for he had scarce a moment to effect his escape but a still greater danger followed for when he left my lady she ordered me to conduct him down stairs without any other light than that of the moon which shone in through the windows lest a taper might alarm some of the servants the chevalier as he descended the stairs made a false step he fell down and his pistol went off the report of which put the whole house into confusion and dismay from that time the countess and the chevalier have carried on a strict correspondence you may now monsieur added she account for that violent grief my lady discovered some time ago when the sight of her lover pale bloody and in appearance dead took from her the power of dissembling you may now know the cause of that melancholy in which she is continually plunged since the chevaliers duel with the count of polan which has forced him to absent himself from her and you know likewise the cause of my dismission from her service i am become a troublesome and importunate inmate whose presence she can no longer support because taking advantage of the chevaliers absence i endeavor to bring her back to her duty and because i am tortured with remorse for the part i have had in her infidelity to my lord  the wretch ended her speech with another shower of tears and with dreadful inprecations on herself if what she had related was not strictly true  monsieur de berci although he had a high opinion of his sisterinlaws virtue yet could not help being staggered at this relation he knew for a certainty that the chevalier des essars was in love with her his own ears had heard him declare it in the forest of beauplan and more than once his eyes in observing those of the chevalier and madame de berci discovered that his sisterinlaw was not insensible yet he could not imagine her capable of a crime so horrid as to dishonor his brother in the manner the vile marianne accused her of after giving a few moments to his reflections on what he had heard he took a resolution full of prudence and generosity as he would not condemn his sisterinlaw upon the reports of her servant so neither could he hold her absolutely innocent in his own opinion since there were some circumstances in her conduct that bore a doubtful appearance he thought it just to wait till he had more certainty of her guilt before he made her infamy public and supposing that if the lovers were realy guilty it would not be impossible for him by the assistance of marianne to surprise them together as soon as the chevalier was again permitted to return to paris he determined to engage this girl in his interest but if it happened that the chevalier should be unable to procure his pardon and remain in perpetual banishment he judged it best to bury all he had heard in oblivion since the honor of his brother would be preserved by the chevaliers absence and having then nothing to fear from his sisterinlaws indiscreet passion there would be no necessity to wound the peace of the count and introduce disorder and infamy into his family  he therefore strictly charged marianne not to impart to any other person in the world what she had said to him he promised to restore her to her ladys favor upon condition that she would give him a faithful account of her whole conduct particularly in every thing that related to the chevalier des essars marianne joyfully swore to obey him and he instantly went to the apartment of the countess to perform his promise he praised the affection and fidelity of that wicked girl he exaggerated her grief for being obliged to quit her service and begged the countess to take compassion on her and if her fault was not very great to admit her to her usual attendance upon her person  madam de berci was softened at this account of her womans contrition she was not sorry that she had a lawful excuse for taking her again for she had been under dreadful apprehensions of her malice she sent for her into her apartment and before her brother told her that through his interposition she had consented to receive her again but as soon as monsieur de berci withdrew she told her with a very severe air that she expected to see a thorough reformation in her conduct and that it was upon that condition alone she restored her to her former place the dissembling marianne with tears in her eyes thanked her lady for her goodness and promised amendment but in her heart she deeply vowed to make her pay dear for the mortifications she had suffered  the countess of berci was scarce relieved from the anxiety this affair had given her when she was assaulted by new disquiets the count her husband had a kinsman who having formerly given some disgust to the court had been banished from france after he had spent some years in traveling over all europe he resolved to settle in venice for the remainder of his life this city which is one of the most celebrated in all italy had peculiar charms for him on account of the freedom that reigned there his quality and merit soon procured him the respect and esteem of the nobility of that powerful republic who though naturally haughty and not easy of access to foreigners yet were solicitous to make his residence amongst them pleasing to him he lived there thirty years and dying suddenly in a very advanced age the count of berci who was his nearest relation succeeded to all his vast riches and as soon as he was informed of his death prepared for a journey to venice to take possession of them  the young marquis de saintsauveur having a desire to visit italy again where he had formerly spent some months with his friend monsieur de morigny entreated the counts leave to accompany him in this voyage mademoiselle de montmartin had not yet taken off her interdiction and he was willing to try if a greater distance from what he loved would not weaken his continual regret at being deprived of her presence besides he was not without hope that an absence which no longer depended upon her will to revoke would give his capricious mistress herself some little anxiety  the count readily agreed to the marquiss proposal and thanked him for offering so frankly what he would have solicited had he not thought it too great a favor they set out immediately for their voyage to venice where they arrived happily the beginning of spring they staid there a month during which time the count settled all his affairs and having a fine season before them they determined to visit rome and some other of the celebrated cities in italy in their return they passed by leghorn where they found a felucca which was only waiting for a favorable wind to set sail for marseilles the count and the marquis eager to see again the dear objects of their affection resolved to embark in this felucca as being the most expeditious way of returning besides the great heat of the weather made traveling by land very disagreeable but they had no sooner reached the coast of genoa when they had reason to repent of their design they were encountered by a corsair of algiers whom they found it impossible to escape from  the two french lords although as brave as men could be yet plainly saw that any resistance they could make would not preserve their liberty but would inevitably expose them to death and perhaps to the most cruel tortures the algerine was manned with a great number of valiant and desperate turks who presented themselves to the attack while they had very few sailors and only some passengers aboard who were destitute of all manner of defense with such inequality it would have been madness to fight it was resolved therefore that they should use their utmost endeavors to escape and if they proved unsuccessful to surrender peaceably that they might not to no purpose irritate those who were likely to be their masters  the turks however having grappled their small vessel boarded it with their cymetars in their hands they stripped the passengers and the crew to their shirts and tying them all to the oar set sail for africa as they were pursuing their voyage full of an insolent and barbarous joy for the prize they had taken their vessel was driven by a storm into the gulf of barcelona where it was attacked by a maltese galley commanded by a spanish knight of the order the miserable captives on board the algerine beholding this unhopedfor assistance offered up the most ardent prayers to heaven for the success of their friends their joy and their hopes were but shortlived the wind which at first was favorable for the maltese galley changed suddenly as it was attempting to grapple that of algiers and the corsair doubting his strength endeavored to escape by the force of rowing which he effected  what a dreadful reverse of fortune was this for the two french lords and the rest of the unhappy captives but the surprise the grief which seized one of those brave knights in the maltese galley when he beheld the two noble slaves are not to be described the chevalier de morigny for it was he himself could scarce believe the evidence of his own eyes when they distinguished the count of berci and the marquis de saint sauveur chained like a great number of other wretches to the oar but these illustrious captives stretching out their arms laden with fetters and calling him by his name convinced him he was not mistaken they had not time to conjure him to save them from the cruelties of their enemies for at that instant the wind seconding the efforts of the rowers to escape the algerine vessel was at once carried away from his eyes and his vengeance  monsieur de morigny was inconsolable at this sad sight notwithstanding all his virtue and his resignation to providence he suffered with some kind of impatience and repining the effects of an event so favorable to those barbarians which deprived him of an opportunity of succouring two friends whom he loved with the tenderest affection the more he reflected on this strange adventure the less he was able to comprehend how the count of berci and his brotherinlaw should happen to be on seas so distant from their native country and chained to an oar in an algerine vessel the more he reflected upon this amazing accident the more his mind was perplexed the only thing that now remained for him to do was to send notice to france of the captivity of his noble friends he wrote to the countess of berci and gave her an affecting relation of the sad spectacle his eyes had seen and wept her noble husband and her brother mingled with slaves and laboring at an oar he assured her that he would himself have made a voyage to africa to procure their deliverance but that his duty obliged him to cruize the remainder of the summer upon the seas he recommended it to her to send instantly some person whose prudence and fidelity she could rely upon to africa to treat with the infidels for the ransom of her lord and her brother  the countess was seized with horror and dismay at the contents of this letter she fell fainting into the arms of her woman upon reading the first lines which acquainted her with the miserable condition of two persons so dear to her and when she recovered it was only to a painful sense of agonising sorrow but her grief violent as it was did not prevent her from contriving instant means for their rescue her lords brother was the person on whom she cast her eyes to manage their redemption monsieur de berci met her request with a zeal that showed the greatness of his affection for his brother no dangers could hinder him from undertaking the voyage to serve him he pressed for a speedy departure and the countess without waiting for an application to her father gave her brotherinlaw all the ready money she had and her richest jewels to make up the sum for the ransom of her husband and her brother monsieur de berci being thus furnished with every thing that was necessary took leave of the afflicted countess and set out for marseilles in order to embark there for africa  the captivity of these two illustrious frenchmen made a great noise at the court of france a friend of the chevalier des essars to whom he had confided the place of his retreat sent him this news into anjou almost as soon as it was known at court the chevalier after giving some tears to the misfortunes of his friends felt a secret satisfaction in his mind at the thoughts of being able to give the countess of berci a new instance of the purity and disinterestedness of his passion he determined to make a voyage instantly to africa and to expose his life his fortunes and perhaps his liberty to free the count of berci and the marquis de saintsauveur from the slavery they groaned under  a lover of equal delicacy can only feel the force of this action and nothing less than a hero can be capable of approving a design which so many almost invincible obstacles seemed to oppose but true love thinks every thing easy to be done when the interest of the beloved object is in question the chevalier des essars listened to nothing but the dictates of his passion and his courage already he tasted the transporting delight of doing his mistress a considerable service and of giving her a new proof of his tenderness he set out immediately for paris in a disguise and securely reached the house of an intimate friend where he staid a few days to provide himself with money necessary for his voyage and the redemption of the two noble captives as soon as every thing was prepared for his departure he wrote a letter to the countess informing her of the occasion of his arrival at paris and the resolution he had taken to set out immediately for marseilles he entreated his friend not to send this letter to the countess till two hours after his departure from paris he thought it necessary to use this precaution lest she should imagine that he wanted to pay his purposed service by the pleasure of seeing her or to draw from her some marks of acknowledgment and full of the pleasing hope of soon restoring to her two persons who were so deservedly dear to her he left paris and took the road to provence attended by the same gentleman whom he had taken with him to anjou  the countess of berci although she had been accustomed to receive very extraordinary proofs of love from the chevalier yet was extremely surprised at this last she admired the generosity and unbounded courage of this faithful lover who seemed born to render her new services her gratitude so strongly engaged her heart for the first time that it delivered itself up to a tenderness she had hitherto suppressed a service of such importance to be so eagerly undertaken without being requested to make a voyage to a barbarous region from whence he might possibly never return with a courage so heroic such perfect disinterestedness to expect no other reward than what he found in the pleasure of serving her and the great delicacy he had shown in renouncing even the satisfaction of seeing her before his departure in a word such striking instances of the most pure and constant passion that ever man was capable of excited during some moments sentiments more soft than friendship and acknowledgments more tender than gratitude a while she indulged the sweetly painful emotions but her duty and her honor those lawful tyrants of her soul soon united their forces to deliver her from the assaults of love  oh prudence too rigid oh virtue too severe cried she bursting into tears suffer me to have some respite you have nothing till this day to reproach me with i will inviolably observe your dictates to the last moment of my life but alas how cruel is my destiny what torments must a tender and grateful heart experience who can no other ways requite such benefits but by new severities  the countess was resigning herself to these melancholy reflections when mademoiselle de montmartin came into her chamber their friendship and intimacy had long ago banished all reserve and entering without sending notice of her arrival she found madam de berci bathed in tears and so lost in grief that she did not perceive her mademoiselle de montmartin ran to her afflicted friend and with a tender anxiety begged to know if any new misfortune had happened to her the countess raising her head and looking on her with eyes which though swimming in tears expressed a kind compassion for her who was but too much concerned in the news she had to tell her at the mention of her lovers captivity mademoiselle de montmartin threw herself upon a sopha with a sigh that seemed to rend her heart in pieces a deadly paleness overspread her face she lifted up her fine eyes in speechless agony to heaven a while she abandoned herself to the bitterness of her reflections then turning to the countess who was sat weeping by her  ah madam said she it is for me to weep who by the foolish extravagance of my conduct have lost perhaps for ever the most faithful lover in the world you have only fortune to complain of i have fortune and myself if your lord groans in fetters you have the consolation of knowing that you are not the author of his miseries but it is my injustice that has thrown my lover into a horrid dungeon my cruelty has reduced him to slavery but for my caprice and folly this dear brother had now been with you comforting you under your misfortunes and endeavoring to redress them without feeling any other himself but what arose from his sympathising tenderness alas my dear countess added she embracing her tenderly ought i to hope that you will pardon my injustice to your brother and then my dear and injured lover pursued she bursting again into tears can thou forget my injurious treatment of thee ah if fate ever restores thee to me will my tenderness and fidelity repay thee for all the torments thou have suffered through me  the countess of berci was greatly moved at the affliction of mademoiselle de montmartin her heart softened by her own woes made her more sensible of those of another these tender and afflicted friends past all their time together the compassion they mutually afforded each other soothed their griefs but the countess had some which she was obliged to smother in her own breast mademoiselle de montmartin was far less to be pitied she might without guilt or restraint resign herself up to the tenderness of a lawful passion and had no vows to make but for the deliverance of her lover but the countess besides her grief for the captivity of a husband and a brother whom she loved trembled for the life of a hero who was dear to her yet whom her duty forbid her to love  the ladies in their calmer moments often talked of the generosity of the chevalier des essars and when their minds were not weakened by dreadful apprehensions concerning the destiny of friends so deservedly dear to them they hoped for every thing favorable from his zeal his courage and his good fortune  mean time monsieur de berci arrived at marseilles and embarked immediately in a vessel that was ready to sail for africa but they suffered a great deal by storms and wandered for more than a month upon the spanish coasts the chevalier des essars was more fortunate he found at marseilles two religious of the order for the redemption of captives who were waiting only for a favorable wind to set sail for oran a fortified town situated in the kingdom of algiers they were to land first at this capital and afterward to proceed to tunis to free a great number of slaves according to the engagements of their pious institution the chevalier was rejoiced at an opportunity of joining persons who by the frequent voyages they had made with a zeal so holy into those barbarous countries were received and treated with respect by the infidels themselves he flattered himself that with the assistance of their charitable diligence they would easily discover the place where his two friends were confined and might more successfully treat for their ransom  he was not deceived in these agreeable expectations the two religious promised him their utmost assistance and the wind becoming fair they embarked and set sail for africa they had a favorable voyage and after some slight storms that were followed by no dangerous accidents they landed safe at oran where they proposed to rest a few days before they executed their commission but the chevalier des essars whose impatience to see his friends at liberty would not suffer him to consult his own health set out instantly for algiers traveling the rest of the way by land as he spoke the spanish tongue perfectly well he easily past for a merchant of that nation who traded in jewels he avoided with great care every thing that might give the infidels the least suspicion of his quality or the occasion of his voyage but let us now return to those illustrious victims of their barbarity  when the count of berci and the marquis de saintsauveur saw that the maltese galley was prevented by the wind which became directly contrary to them from getting up to the corsair and that there was no probability of their being delivered from their slavery they abandoned themselves to the most frightful despair their grief was increased even by the sight of monsieur de morigny that friend so dear to them both upon whose valor they depended more than upon that of all the other brave knights that accompanied him this cruel event filled them with the most melancholy reflections all the horrors of that destiny which waited for them at algiers rose to their imaginations their minds being weakened by the terrible apprehensions they labored under they soon became incapable of performing the laborious exercise to which they were destined and this incapacity drew upon them an increase of severity from their cruel masters at length they resigned themselves with submission to the decrees of that providence which orders all human events they relied with a pious confidence upon it and indulged a hope that the chevalier morigny would not forget them in their misfortunes this last thought gave them great consolation and flattering themselves that the corsair would not separate them in their prison they determined to wait with patience for the happy moment of their deliverance  but this barbarian had no intention to grant them such a favor the noble air and the rich dress they were in when he took them made him conclude that they were men of high quality he determined therefore not to sell them but to make their slavery so insupportable by his hash treatment as to make them glad to purchase their liberty at any price he should demand for it  as soon as they landed at algiers he ordered them to be thrown into separate dungeons where they had not the least glimmering of light he would not allow them to take leave of each other they begged only for a parting embrace and the request was punished with stripes which they suffered with such a noble patience and such dignity of silent grief as would have moved any other heart but that of a corsair accustomed to treat christians with the most savage cruelty  on the fourth day of their miserable confinement the doors of their dungeons were opened but it was only to expose the count of berci to a treatment still more humbling and rigorous than what he had yet endured as he was of a constitution more strong and robust than the marquis de saintsauveur the inhuman corsair destined him to labor in his lands in the country he caused him to be conducted thither with five other slaves tied two and two together like the vilest animals he placed a wretch as cruel as himself over them who gave them no intermission from their labor and who punished every symptom of weariness with stripes and abusive language they were allowed no other nourishment than bread and water and at night when their labor was ended they were thrown covered with sweat and dust into a dark damp dungeon where a little straw was all that composed their bed  what a dreadful situation for a man of the first quality brought up in luxury and surrounded with pleasures the marquis de saint sauveur was treated with less barbarity but he owed his indulgence to the avarice of the corsair the great delicacy of his make made the wretch apprehensive that he should lose him if he put him to labors beyond his strength he was therefore employed in his gardens but his grief at being separated from the count joined to his other disquiets of which love was the most poignant made his misfortunes not less unsupportable  the count of berci could not long support the weight of so many miseries he sunk under them at length and fell dangerously ill his master beginning to fear that he should lose him ordered proper nourishment to be given him and allowed him some intermission from his labor but as soon as he had recovered strength he was again obliged to resume his first employment  the chevalier des essars had been four days in algiers without being able to do any thing for his friends the pirate had been absent three weeks but at his return the chevalier immediately sent the two religious to him who had been the companions of his voyage they offered him a very considerable sum for the ransom of several captives among whom they comprehended the two french lords they discovered no particular solicitude concerning them lest the terms of their redemption should be made more difficult this artifice did not succeed the corsair made a great difference between them and his other slaves and demanded such an extravagant sum for their freedom that the two religious thought proper to speak to him no more on the subject for some days that they might not confirm him in the notion he had conceived of their quality  the chevalier whose impatience to see his friends at liberty could not bear any delay thought every moment an age till he had purchased their release and ordered the two friars to give the pirate whatever he demanded but they prudently represented to him that if they proceeded in that manner with the avaricious corsair he would insist upon still harder conditions and would advance his price in proportion as he saw them eager for their deliverance the chevalier was at length prevailed upon to trust their experience and zeal with the conclusion of a bargain which he desired so ardently accordingly these holy men went three days afterward to the pirates house and without taking any notice of the two noble slaves offered to ransom twelve others for which they immediately agreed upon the price the pirate seeing them preparing to go without mentioning the prisoners he had taken in his last prize was the first to propose a sum for their ransom the religious affecting great indifference agreed at last to give ten thousand livres which the corsair accepted and they promised him to bring the money the next morning  that moment so earnestly desired by the chevalier at last came the religious paid the sum agreed on and flew to open those dreadful prisons the eternal abode of horror and of grief after telling the unhappy sufferers with proper caution that they were now at liberty their fetters were struck off and they were led into the open air the unexpected news of his freedom had such an effect upon the count of berci whose mind and body were greatly weakened that he fainted away in the arms of the marquis de saintsauveur who had been first taken out of his miserable confinement and had eagerly advanced to embrace him the religious finding all endeavors to recover the count from his swoon ineffectual they carried him in that condition to the lodgings of the chevalier des essars  that faithful friend was expecting them with an anxious impatience he ran to strain them in his arms and welcome them to freedom and happiness when seeing the count brought in motionless he stopped short grief and amazement usurped the place of joy he thought he was dead for a livid paleness overspread his face and he was so emaciated that he was hardly to be known he was beginning to give vent to his grief and his complaints for this new misfortune when the marquis de saintsauveur who know not of the chevaliers arrival at algiers threw himself suddenly into his arms with exclamations of surprise and joy for some moments they held each other in a strict embrace without the power of expressing their sentiments any otherwise than by tears their solicitude for their friend at length drew them out of this rapture they both sprung in one instant to him and by proper applications he was at length brought out of his swoon he opened his eyes but it was only to turn them wildly about on the objects around him in a few moments his speech and understanding returned and the marquis and the chevalier meeting his eyes his surprise at this view had like to have brought on a relapse  allpowerful heaven cried he with a voice seeble and languishing but expressive of the emotions his heart labored with what do i see is it a dream or am i really awake  what wonders have i beheld this day oh gracious and all wise providence i adore thy infinite goodness in bringing to me again these friends so dear to my soul  finish oh finish thy work almighty power pursued he with eyes and hands raised toward heaven and restore me likewise to the sight of her without whom i cannot live  then holding out his hand to the chevalier des essars who stood regarding his action with eyes swimming in tears of tenderness and joy dear and faithful friend pursued he cease to load us thus with benefits or teach us how to acknowledge them in a manner worthy of thee but is it possible to make suitable returns to this last proof of your generous friendship oh brother added he turning to the marquis our lives have long since been his gift under god can either of us refuse to sacrifice them for his service  the chevalier unable to bear these transports of his gratitude ran into his arms and embracing him tenderly congratulated him on his liberty he then quitted him to the marquis who claimed a share in the endearments of the beloved husband of his sister  when these mutual raptures were a little subsided they gave each other an account of what had happened to them during their separation the chevalier was greatly affected at the recital of what his friends had suffered the count in particular whom the corsairs had treated so cruelly that not even the joy of his recovered liberty nor the tender cares of his friends could hinder him from feeling the effects of it he was seized with a violent fever which held him fourteen days during the whole time that his recovery was doubtful the chevalier and the marquis were in the utmost affliction but the natural strength of his constitution at length overcame the disease and his health restored tranquillity and joy to his sympathising friends who now thought of nothing but hastening their departure  mean time young berci who had been tossed about by contrary winds and in great danger from several storms arrived at length safe at algiers the chevalier des essars and the marquis de saintsauveur were walking upon the port of that city whither they were drawn by the beauty of the place and the necessity they had for some fresh air when the vessel that brought monsieur de berci entered the harbor with full sails the chevalier and the marquis were upon the point of returning home to the count who on account of some remainder of weakness could not accompany them in their walk when their curiosity to see the passengers who were preparing to land detained them a few moments longer but their surprise was extreme to see the counts brother among them they ran eagerly to embrace him nor was he less astonished at the sight of the marquis and the chevalier one of whom he believed in fetters and the other in the heart of anjou he immediately concluded that the chevalier had prevented him in his design nor could he guard his mind from a little emotion of jealousy he regretted that his brother and the marquis should owe their deliverance from slavery to any other than himself after the fatigue and dangers he had endured to have the satisfaction of doing them that service but these thoughts soon gave way to his anxiety for his brother he enquired with a tender impatience for him they soon released him from his apprehensions at not seeing him with them and carried him immediately to their lodgings  the count of berci was not less astonished than they had been at the sight of his brother he embraced him tenderly and expressed the highest acknowledgment for this proof of his affection with a trembling eagerness he enquired after the health of his wife and when monsieur de berci showed him her jewels which she had given him to purchase his freedom he burst into tears of joy gratitude and love his impatience to see again that dear object of his fondest wishes gave him new strength and he declared that he was able to embark immediately for france  his friends however impatient themselves to return to their native country which was still more endeared to them by the remembrance of those beloved persons they had left in it insisted upon the counts staying till his health was perfectly reestablished the count of berci had a motive more strong for his delay he could not think of leaving his servants that had been taken with him in the felucca victims to the cruelty of the algerines he judged of their sufferings by his own and his compassion for them being heightened by that painful remembrance he was resolved not to leave algiers till he had effected their deliverance it was not without great difficulty that they were found they had been all sold by the corsairs and had more than once changed their masters during the continuance of their slavery the count of berci thought himself under an indispensible obligation to ransom them those unhappy men had been so barbarously treated that they were the more sensible of the generous kindness of their lord in giving them freedom  nothing now opposed their speedy departure the count and the marquis expressed their gratitude to the two religious who had treated so prudently for their ransom by making them several noble presents but they did not stop there they left very considerable sums in their hands to open the dungeons of a great number of christians who had long suffered all the rigors of slavery they thought they could not better express their gratitude to their maker for their own deliverance than by freeing their fellow creatures and their brethren in the same communion out of the hands of infidels who blasphemed his holy name by this pious use of part of their great riches they hoped to draw a blessing upon the remainder and this act of charity performed they all embarked on board a vessel that was preparing to sail for provence and let for ever that barbarous region where they had suffered such cruel torments at length that god whom they had invoked in their affliction and whom they had rendered propitious by their alms who commands the winds and the waves who bids tempests be still and smooths the face of the deep that god protected them throughout their voyage and gave them to land safely at marseilles three months and some odd days after the departure of the chevalier des essars for africa  the end of the second part the history of the chevalier des essars and the countess of berci part iii the count of berci and his noble friends as soon as they landed at marseilles offered up a solemn thanksgiving to god for the mercies they had received they stayed some days there not so much to take a view of all the beauties of that celebrated city which for its strength its extent and the security of its commerce was in such high esteem and drew to it continually merchants from every nation in the universe but to rest themselves after the fatigues of a long voyage their impatience to see the countess of berci and mademoiselle de montmartin prompted the count and the marquis to a speedy departure the chevalier though he was not at liberty to own his motive was no less eager to get to paris accordingly they pursued their journey with all possible haste and reached that great capital toward aut  they alighted all together at the count of bercis hotel he would not suffer the chevalier to seek any other asylum than one which he by his friendly solicitude could render most secure to him he told him that he would not part with him till the king had signed his pardon which he hoped he would not refuse to his solicitations and that of his friends all of whom would interest themselves in his behalf the chevalier expressed the highest gratitude to the count for his friendly offers which too agreably flattered his secret wishes not to be accepted with joy  it is not easy to give an idea of that mixture of surprise joy tenderness and grateful rapture which filled the souls of the countess of berci and mademoiselle de montmartin at the sight of persons so dear to them the marquis de saintsauveur threw himself at the feet of his charming mistress whose eyes welcomed him with streaming tenderness while the count ran into the arms of his wife and in the most endearing language expressed his joy at seeing her again it was with difficulty he tore himself from her soft embrace to present the chevalier des essars to her  see madam said he to her that tender and generous friend who makes it the business of his life to serve us who not satisfied with having more than once delivered us from impending death has now freed us from the horrors of a slavery far more to be dreaded the countess advanced immediately to salute him pleased that her duty and her inclinations this once coincided she gave free vent to the grateful sentiments that filled her soul she praised his generous friendship she acknowledged the great obligations she owed him and assured him she should ever preserve the most grateful remembrance of them  i have done nothing madam said the chevalier interrupting the countess than what any other in the same circumstances and with the same incitements would have done but were the services i have been so happy to render your lord and your brother far more considerable they would be overpaid by the sensibility you are pleased to express for them and am i not doubly rewarded pursued he smiling and directing the eyes of the count and countess to the young marquis who was pouring out his soul in grateful transports at the feet of his mistress by the pleasure i feel myself at restoring a faithful lover to the object of his wishes  the marquis and mademoiselle de montmartin finding they were observed joined the rest of the company and the conversation became more general that lovely girl thought it would be no violation of the laws of modesty and decorum to join her thanks for the delivery of the noble captives to those of the countess of berci she could no longer disguise her real sentiments her joy to see again the marquis after a cruel captivity which had appeared so tedious to her broke out in every look and action  the happy lover on his side assured her that his absence from her was a torment far greater than all the hardships he had suffered from his barbarous masters in africa a calm and settled joy succeeded their first transports at this happy meeting and in the present satisfaction all remembrance of past evils was forgot  some days afterward the count of berci and the marquis de saintsauveur went to the louvre to pay their duty to his majesty and both resolved to use their utmost endeavors to obtain a pardon for the chevalier des essars that prince who had been informed of their captivity had the goodness to assure them of his concern for the miseries they had suffered in algiers he commanded the count to give him a particular relation of their slavery and the treatment which they had received from the infidels the count obeyed and the great heart of henry was sensibly affected with the melancholy detail the count of berci seeing his majesty so much moved thought this a favorable moment for the chevalier and continuing his relation he informed the king in what manner they were delivered from their chains and how greatly they had been obliged to the chevalier des essars who had generously undertaken a voyage to africa for their service and by his wise and prudent conduct obtained their liberty observing the king struck with such a noble instance of friendship and generosity the count of berci entered into a justification of his friends conduct with respect to his last combat with the count of polan he explained to his majesty the necessity the chevalier was under to take notice of the injury he received which was publicly charged to the count of polan he produced the counts answer to the challenge sent him by the chevalier as a proof of what he advanced then the marquis and he throwing themselves at the kings feet besought him to pardon the chevalier des essars in consideration of his great valor his inviolable fidelity to his sovereign  his aimable character and the wrong he had suffered by which he was provoked to take revenge  the king was a little shook by their entreaties and the arguments urged in favor of the chevalier but when he reflected that a man whom all the kingdom knew to be particularly dear to him was killed by the chevalier in defiance of his edicts and at the hazard of mortally offending him all the solicitations of the count and the marquis could not prevail with him to pardon their friend they returned home full of grief for their bad success and this cloud that hung over the chevaliers fortune embittered their joys for their happy return to france  the countess of berci and mademoiselle de montmartin were greatly afflicted at this rigor of his majesty as they thought unjustly exerted in the case of the chevalier but although their affliction arose from motives very different in each yet it was pretty near equal for in a generous heart gratitude produces sentiments as tender as those of love mean time the marquis de saintsauveur pursued his good fortune with mademoiselle de montmartin his sufferings on her account had augmented her tenderness she had made too full a discovery of her sentiments to the countess and even to her lover himself to indulge any farther female parade without incurring the censure of affectation and caprice the marquis with a lovers ardor pressed for an early day  mademoiselle de montmartin but faintly denied as she was entirely mistress of herself and fortune she could form no excuse for a longer delay she therefore yielded to give the marquis her hand as soon as the necessary preparations for their marriage were made the countess was charmed with her ready compliance and mademoiselle de montmartin obligingly assured her that the happiness she proposed to herself in acquiring such a sister was not one of her least motives for so sudden a consent though she allowed to her brothers faithful passion and her own inclinations in his favor their full force  letters were immediately dispatched to burgundy to the old marquis de saintsauveur and his lady acquainting them with mademoiselle de montmartins consent to give her hand to their son which was an event they had both earnestly wished for in the expected happiness of such a union they buried all remembrance of their past sorrows for the captivity of their only son and although weakened with age and infirmities they resolved to take a journey to paris and honor with their presence the solemnity of his nuptials  the old nobleman and his lady were infinitely delighted to find the chevalier des essars at their soninlaws hotel the count of berci presented him to them with his usual tenderness the old marquis embraced him with transport calling him the preserver of himself and his family the marchioness received his compliments with the tenderness of a mother to a worthy son the chevalier politely begged that he might be allowed to offer them his hotel for their residence during their stay in paris since added he smiling the count of bercis hospitality has obliged me to become an inmate here the old marquis and his lady gratefully accepted his offer they were conducted thither in the evening by their son and the count and countess of berci and the next morning mademoiselle de montmartin went to pay her respects to them  the old marquis and his lady were charmed with the beauty good sense and politeness of their designed daughterinlaw they applauded their son for his choice and not the less for having consulted as they supposed fortune as well as external qualities in that choice the young marquis suffered his parents to attribute as much prudence to him as they pleased though his heart told him that mademoiselle de montmartins fortune great as it was was nevertheless one of his least inducements for making his addresses to her  the nuptials of the young marquis de saintsauveur and mademoiselle de montmartin were celebrated with a magnificence suitable to their quality and riches but alas how was the pomp of that days ceremony darkened what bitter grief succeeded to their joys that day was at once to the new married couple and their friends the happiest and most miserable of their lives  the ceremony of the marriage performed the bride and bridegroom with their relations and friends went to the hotel of the chevalier des essars where monsieur and madam de saintsauveur had caused a splendid entertainment to be prepared at one oclock in the morning the new married pair retired the rest of the company continued dancing but the count and countess of berci after they had attended the bride and bridegroom to their apartment returned home without taking leave of the company that they might not oblige them to break up  the chevalier des essars on account of the disgrace he was in with the king was not able to assist at this days ceremony he went early to bed but an unusual inquietude for which he could assign no cause hindered him from sleeping he rose and walked about his chamber and when he thought he had fatigued himself with that exercise he went again to bed but sleep still sled his eyes his imagination was tortured with sad and dismal images that would not leave him a moments repose he started at every little noise without knowing why his heart beat in an unusual measure and he was preparing again to rise when he heard the counts coach at the gate  the arrival of the count and countess seemed to suspend his uneasiness he heard them pass by his antichamber and he again endeavored to take some rest monsieur and madam de berci after enquiring of the chevaliers health retired to their own chamber marianne whose conduct had been strictly observed by her lady ever since the discovery she had made of her amor took advantage of that days solemnity which she concluded would keep the count and countess very late from home to admit her lover once more into her chamber she could not imagine they would return so soon as they did but hearing the coach she caused verague to dress himself hastily and having concealed him in her closet she presented herself before her lady with an assured countenance and assisted in undressing her as usual  as soon as she was dismissed she returned immediately to verague but would not suffer him to attempt to go away till she thought the count and her lady were asleep the door of this womans room opened into the countesss antichamber verague must necessarily pass through it to get to the back stairs when marianne thought he might venture safely she conducted him with as little noise as possible to the door however the count who was not asleep heard his steps a fatal curiosity to know who it was passing so late through his ladys apartment made him rise and throwing his nightgown over him he went into the antichamber verague had stopped there a moment to listen whether none of the domestics were still up hearing the counts chamber door open he attempted to gain the staircase but with so much precipitation and fear that he made a false step upon the first stair which gave the count of berci an opportunity to lay hold on him verague made desperate by his fears for his own life and the dishonor of his mistress took a poignard he wore in his bosom when he went upon such adventures and endeavored to disengage himself from the count by wounding him in the arm but the count by a sudden motion received the stroke full in his side verague now easily breaking from his hold ran down stairs and climbing over the walls of the courtyard which were very low he got into a little garden of the door of which marianne had given him a key and escaped without discovery  the unhappy count of berci fell to the ground with the stroke he had received and feeling his blood flowing fast from his wound he called for help with a loud voice his gentleman whose chamber was very near and who happened to be up and reading took up a candle and ran to the place where his lords voice had directed him at the sight of the count extended upon the ground and covered with blood he made the house resound with his cries the countess awaking in great terrors and not finding her lord beside her hastily arose threw on a loose robe and calling marianne flew out of her apartment the chevalier met her at the head of the staircase what a spectacle for the wife and the friend the count weltering in his blood supported against the wall while his gentleman was endeavoring to bind up his wound with his cravat  madam de berci uttered a piercing groan and sunk down by her almost expiring lord the chevalier for some moments stood motionless with grief and amazement the servants running from every part of the house were preparing to take up their bleeding master when the chevalier roused from his silent agony eagerly lent his trembling arm and with the assistance of his gentleman carried the count into his chamber and laid him upon his bed surgeons were immediately sent for but he feeling his strength almost exhausted turned his dying eyes toward the countess who supported by her women stood at his bedside in anguish unutterable  cease madam said he to her cease to resign yourself to a fruitless grief your tears and your despair cannot restore me to your love but will embitter my last moments it is done i have finished my course parting with you is all the grief i feel in death but i return thanks to heaven for calling me away first and spareing me the affliction of surviving you we have lived happy in each others affection i die contented and i conjure you with my last breath not to revenge my death  i pardon the authors of it continued he looking at marianne who was in visible agitations nor must you my dear countess refuse me another request it is said he taking the chevaliers hand who stood by him in an agony of grief that after my death you will transfer the affection you have borne me to this dear this faithful friend let him possess my place in your heart bless him with your hand and both of you cherish my remembrance  may the god of all mercies pursued the dying count with eyes fervently raised to heaven pour down his choicest blessings upon you and grant me an asylum in the bosom of my  he was not able to utter more his hand lost its hold of the chevalier his eyes for ever shut out the light and faintly groaning he expired  the chevalier ordered the countesss attendants to convey her instantly into another chamber that she might not behold a spectacle capable of shocking her reason the effects of her grief were so much the more to be apprehended as it neither vented itself in tears or complaint her eyes remained always fixed on one object like a person in the last agonies of death a mortal paleness overspread her face for a while she seemed to have neither sense or motion at length she was seized with convulsions which held her so long that her life was despaired of it would have been happy for her had fate then put a period to her miserable days but she was reserved to suffer greater woes by the force of medicines she recovered to a sense of grief painful return to life she now felt and deplored her loss the chevalier staid by her till the convulsions had left her and her reason was a little restored he neither could nor would attempt to console her that he judged must be the work of time and his heart was too much oppressed by his own sorrows to make him capable of administering comfort to another  mean time the news of this tragical accident was carried to the hotel of the chevalier des essars and changed the mirth and pleasures of the ball into tears and lamentations every one ran with distracted haste to the counts hotel an assassination committed upon his person in his own house at the dead of night and by an unknown hand filled all who heard it with horror and amazement a strict search was ordered to be made but the murderer could not be discovered all the doors of the house were found fastened nor was it possible by any circumstance that appeared to form any certain judgment all that could admit of no doubt was that the murder had been committed by one who had been all night concealed in the house  during all this time a thousand gloomy reflections rolled in the mind of monsieur de berci the deceased counts brother he was resolved to spend all the rich possessions he was left heir to in discovering the authors of the assassination and revenging it he caused all the men servants to be carried to prison and upon the recital that was made him of his brothers last words for he was not present having staid behind the count and countess at the chevalier des essars of the meaning look he had cast upon marianne and the trouble and confusion it occasioned in her he made her be taken up likewise and conducted to prison the counts servants went through the interrogatory and the innocence was no less apparent by the sincere grief they showed for the loss of their master than their clear and unvarying answers to the questions that were put to them  when marianne was examined she absolutely disavowed having any concern in the murder and to remove any suspicions that might be entertained against herself or her lover she declared to the lieutenant criminel with an amazing confidence that it was from the countess of berci herself that they ought to seek an explanation of that dark affair she asserted that her ladys passion for the chevalier des essars who had lain for some time concealed in the house was doubtless the true cause of the counts assassination to support this charge she related all that had passed in the castle of beauplan the secret interview between the chevalier and madam de berci by night her free remonstrances to her lady upon so shameful a conduct which were so ill received that she dismissed her from her service but at the intercession of the counts brother to whom she had disclosed the amor between the chevalier and her lady she had been pardoned by her and continued in her place hereupon the lieutenant criminal thought proper to have monsieur de berci examined his answers agreed with mariannes deposition as far as it related to the account she had given him of his sisterinlaws amor with the chevalier but he observed to that magistrate that he had made mariannes peace with her lady upon condition that she should give him notice of all her steps with regard to the chevalier that since that the countess of berci might have had many opportunities of seeing the chevalier in private if ever she had admitted of such a freedom and marianne could not have been unacquainted with it and would consequently have given him notice of those stolen interviews in performance of her promise but she had never done it therefore he concluded it was not in her power to give any such proof of her ladys dishonor for it was not to be imagined that she who new accused madam de berci of being concerned in the murder of her lord would have neglected to discover a slighter fault if she had been able the lieutenant criminel although he found some reason in what monsieur de berci had urged in favor of the countess and that in the deposition of marianne only very light presumptions could he formed against madam de berci and the chevalier des essars yet thought it necessary ta issue out an order for taking the countess into custody mosieur de berci foresaw this he was fully persuaded of his sisterinlaws innocence the observations he had made to the lieutenant civil was the result of deep reflection on her conduct her grief for her lords captivity the generous sacrifice she had of her jewels to procure his release fearing that a much larger sum would be demanded for his ransom than they could immediatly raise her unfeigned affliction for his death which had brought her to the last extremity the uncommon friendship shown by the chevalier in making a voyage to africa to deliver the count was all this consistent with a criminal amor between them and such complicated wickedness as the assassination of the count apparently the beloved husband and the valued friend of them who were accused to be the authors of it monsieur de berci rejected the thought with horror his esteem and affection for his sisterinlaw increased in proportion as he thought she suffered unjustly in her character he flew to inform her of the order issued for seizing her and exhorted her with tears to seek some asylum where she might be secured against so cruel an affront the countess trembled with horror at the news of her being suspected to be an accomplice in so dreadful a crime a generous indignation took place of those first emotions and overspread her fair face which ever since the death of her lord had lost all its freshness with a transient blush  oh woman cried she when her brotherinlaw repeated to her the deposition of marianne oh woman unworthy of the light detested monster sent from hell to be my destruction what reward do thou promise thyself for thy infamous falsehood is it my life thy wicked malice aims at alas it is now grown indifferent to me grief would probably have done thy work but that does not content thee i must dye upon a scaffold and my fame must be murdered as well as my person prosecute wretch thy cruel scheme the silent testimony of a clear conscience shall be my comfort and the review of a life free from reproach my defense  monsieur de berci could not hear this affecting apostrophe to that infamous slanderer without tears and execrations the countess expressed a grateful acknowledgment for the interest he took in her misfortunes she then desired him to send the chevalier des essars to her and as soon as he entered her apartment she related to him all that her brotherinlaw had told her concerning the wicked marianne and her own impending danger  the chevalier was in agonies at the recital of so horrid a calumny his rage at the aspersions cast upon the countess and his terrors at what might be the consequence of them made him appear like one distracted he traversed the chamber with a furious pace forgetting that she was present and casting up his eyes to heaven seemed to upbraid it for permitting such virtue to suffer but recollecting himself at length he approached the countess with a calmer air and asked her what in the present exigence she resolved to do begging her to command him freely whose life was wholly devoted to her service  the countess who had taken her resolution replied with great composure that her innocence was her security and that she would stand her trial  the chevalier who had not expected such firmness was at first lost in astonishment and admiration but anxious for her safety and judging that there was no time to lose he represented to her that she ought not to abandon a life so precious to the precarious judgments of men often unjust and cruel madam de berci alleged that her flight would give her the appearance of guilt that she would rely entirely upon her innocence and the interposition of providence and wait patiently for the event of such an undeserved accusation  the chevalier finding her determined to expose herself to all the dangers that threatened her was almost distracted he threw himself at her feet and with tears conjured her to take measures for preserving herself but she unmoved with all he could say obstinately persisted in her resolution to suffer the horrors of confinement in a dreadful prison the infamy of a public trial and the agony of a shameful death if such was her lot and with absolute resignation to the will of heaven drink the bitter cup that was prepared for her  but at the same time that the countess thus fearlesly braved her own fate she trembled at the danger of a man so deservedly dear to her she conjured him to fly and leave her to the protection of heaven the chevalier declared that he would share her fate whatever that might be madam de berci entreated wept all was in vain she then assumed an appearance of rage and threatened never to pardon him if he refused to give her this last proof of his obedience to her will even this was ineffectual at last she told him that her interest required he should be safe and at liberty that he might be able to assist her if her enemies should bring things to extremity  this last thought made some impression upon the chevalier he considered that if he should suffer himself to be taken the count of polans friends would not fail to urge the king to have the sentence he had pronounced executed upon him so that the countess would be effectually deprived of all the assistance he was able to give her he had many great and powerful friends all of whom he could engage in the interests of madam de berci while he continued free but when he was once in custody would have enough to do to procure his pardon for the death of the kings favorite he therefore agreed to the countesss proposal determining within himself to die with her if he failed in his endeavors to save her  i go madam said he with tears in his eyes in obedience to your commands as long as i can be useful to you my life will be worth my care and when it ceases to be so i know how to die he kised her hand as he pronounced these words and hurrying out of her apartment met the two marquisses de saintsauveur who were come hastily to see the countess the chevalier embraced them affectionately and recommending madam de berci to their tender cares retired to the house of a faithful friend where he determined to wait the effect of her resolution  he had scarce been gone two hours when he was informed that the countess had been arrested and notwithstanding the vigorous efforts of her relations to save her from such an ignominy was conducted to the little chatelet she had been torn out of the arms of her father and the young marchioness de saintsauveur who hung upon her while her unhappy mother sunk upon the ground in a fainting fit at the sight of the dreadful officers of justice who came to convey her to prison  oh blind and cruel fortune shall virtue ever be persecuted by thee and thy severest malice be exercised upon those who most deserve thy smiles  when the countess entered the fatal place which was henceforward to be her habitation the melancholy gloom the wretched furniture the grated windows the frightful solitude filled her mind with horrors till then unfelt all that fortitude the pride of suffering virtue the secret calm of conscious innocence upon which she had depended were too little to support her under such dreadful circumstances she had now none of that boasted courage left which had lessened every trial she could be called to and made her imagine herself more than equal to them all filled with horror and despair she threw her streaming eyes around the miserable room surveying it with distracted eagerness then sinking upon a chair and giving a loose to the anguish that oppressed her she wrung her hands and struck her groaning breast where art thou now unhappy wretch cried she is thy once splendid fortune reduced to this an inmate of a horrid prison confounded with the vilest criminals branded with horrid crimes and threatened with a shameful death ah my dearest lord pursued she was not the remembrance of thy unhappy fate sufficient to afflict me but i must be charged with being the author of it just heaven let me not find fault with thy decrees suffer not my rebellious heart to murmur at my undeserved woes let me submit with patience to my destiny and since i have lived with innocence let me die with resignation  the woman who had been appointed to attend the countess rather indeed to be a spy upon her behavior than to do her service could not hear this affecting language without tears the youth and beauty of madam de berci had the moment she beheld her excited her compassion and insensibly removed that prejudice which she had conceived against a woman charged with so black a crime she could not look on her and imagine her capable of cruelty she could not hear her and believe her a hypocrite after two or three days attendance upon her she discovered so much unaffected piety in her behavior such gentleness of manners such perfect resignation and such a calm yet steady courage as persuaded her she was wholly innocent  madam de berci soon perceived this woman had entertained favorable thoughts of her her extreme assiduity to oblige her the tender concern she expressed for her misfortunes drew from the grateful countess acknowledgments that entirely won her heart the unfortunate are ever ready to overrate the benefits they receive because they are unexpected madam de berci although she showed herself grateful in the highest degree yet had a dignity in her manner which enhanced the value of her condescensions the exigencies of her situation required that she should court the friendship of this woman and she succeeded without difficulty and without humiliation the horrors of her confinement were in some degree moderated by this incident but the shame and disgrace she suffered and the uncertainty of what might be her fate innocent as she was was sufficient to overwhelm her with sorrow death was not what she dreaded her miseries had made life hateful to her but to die loaded with infamy to suffer the stroke of an executioner upon a public scaffold branded with the crimes of adultery and murder shocked her almost to madness  after a weeks imprisonment the lieutenant criminal entered suddenly into her chamber in order to interrogate her she trembled at first at the sight of this austere magistrate the thoughts of being obliged to answer like a criminal in a posture so unworthy of her quality and innocence threw her into some confusion but here her piety came to her aid she humbled herself under the chastising hand of the almighty and with a perfect submission to his will suffered the ignominious examination she confessed the adventure of the forest and the interview she had had with the chevalier des essars in the castle of beauplan but she took god to witness for the innocence of her intentions and her conduct the judge after taking her confession in writing which he read to her and she signed withdrew  neither the countess of berci nor marianne had made any mention of verague in their examinations that assassin was carefully concealed in paris in the house of one of his near relations he staid there for some days to see what turn the affair would take but though he found himself in safety he was tortured with the stings of his own guilt this man was a gentleman by birth he had not hitherto committed any flagrant crimes the terror he was in lest the reputation of his mistress should be blasted made him desperate he found he could not disengage himself from the count who held him fast and called aloud for lights his situation gave him not time for reflection it was necessary he should speedily escape for the preservation of his own life and his mistresss honor and he could no other ways effect it than by ridding himself of the count guided by a sudden impulse he stabbed him with his poignard but aimed the stroke at the arm which held him the unfortunate count received it in his breast and verague fled full of horror at the action he had committed and fear of the consequences when he found that the countess of berci and the chevalier des essars were accused of the murder of the count his heart was touched with remorse but he had neither fortitude nor generosity enough to clear their innocence by confessing himself the assassin of that unhappy nobleman he could not however endure to be in a place which every moment recalled to him the remembrance of his crime for which two innocent persons were persecuted he was apprehensive likewise that marianne terrified at the fatal consequences of her guilt would endeavor to repair the mischiefs she had been the cause of and would deliver him up to justice but he judged too favorably of that hardened wretch the persecution she saw the countess suffer gratified her malice while it secured her safety she could never forgive her for the severe reproaches she made her on account of her amor with verague and for the resolution she had taken to dismiss her from her service  it is one of the greatest triumphs of vice to behold virtue in distress marianne exulted in her own mind over her suffering lady and hardened herself in her crime by reflecting on the advantages she had now over that scrupulous virtue which rather than wink at her failings had exposed its owner though innocent to all the consequences of detected guilt but verague who had not even trusted her with the place of his concealment did not know the full extent of his wickedness and was ignorant of his own security he therefore resolved to leave paris and shelter himself in england but change of place could bring no relief to the tortures of his mind the blood he had shed haunted his imagination with horrors which made that life he feared to lose insupportable to him and the dangers the innocent countess was exposed to through his crime gave new stings to a conscience sufficiently wounded before  the lieutenant criminal was extremely concerned to find that the chevalier des essars had escaped his vigilance the strictest search imaginable was made for him but to no purpose he was perfectly safe in the asylum he had chose but devoured with melancholy and a prey to the most bitter reflections the murder of his friend the sufferings of his beloved countess were never out of his thoughts and almost overturned his reason  madam de berci who possessed more real delicacy and greatness of mind than half her sex had never when pressed by her brotherinlaw to receive marianne again into her service taken the least notice to him of the cause for which she had dismissed her he therefore was wholly ignorant of her intrigue with verague she was silent likewise upon that head when she was interrogated by the lieutenant criminal her agonies when she beheld her lord wounded to death and weltering in his blood were too great to suffer her attention to be free enough to observe the conscious look he gave marianne and the confusion it caused in that wicked girl at times indeed she had some suspicions of the truth but as they were only suspicions she did not think herself authorized to accuse any one her pride suggested to her likewise that she should level herself with her infamous servant to retort scandal for scandal since she had no means of proving her assertions and marianne had the advantage of having first accused her which she thought would render every thing she afterward said suspected this false reasoning was the source of all her miseries had she discovered her vile womans amor with verague his flight with several other concurring circumstances would have made him known to have been the author of her lords assissination but she herself was ignorant of his having left france and as none of her family knew of his connection with marianne it was a circumstance not attended to by them and if not by them no other person had any concern in it madam de berci trusting her justification to providence consoled herself with the consciousness of her innocence and in her piety and resignation to the will of heaven found a support that enabled her to undergo her afflictions  mean time the chevalier never one moment forgot the lovely prisoner as he could not solicit her cause openly he engaged all his friends in her interest the ardor and zeal with which they undertook her defense were so much the greater as they were convinced of her innocence and that of their friend even the public though often very unjust in its censures could not be persuaded that this brave man was capable of committing a crime so unworthy of his courage his generosity and his birth those only who were strangers to his fame and his great qualities and the friends of the count of polan whom he had killed in his last duel were capable of saying that he was the author of so detestable an action  the two marquesses de saintsauveur were inconceivably afflicted for the misfortunes of the countess but her mother and her new sisterinlaw were in a condition truly pitiable the sorrow of that tender friend for the undeserved sufferings of madam de berci was equal to that of her who had given her birth under what fatal auspices had hymen lighted his torch for her her nuptials resembled a funeral rather than a bridal solemnity tears groans and agonizing aprehensions left no room for love or joy none of the relations of madam de berci entertained the slightest suspicion of her virtue they were alike convinced of the honor and probity of the chevalier they knew where he lay concealed and often visited him to lament the hard fate of the innocent countess and to concert measures for her relief  that unfortunate lady was not allowed the consolation of seeing her friends her father and mother were denied permission to visit her yet amidst this complicated misery her mind was composed her behavior expressed a calm and decent sorrow and in that the death of her lord had greater part than her own disgrace and danger  the old marquis de saintsauveur although he had a great opinion of his daughters virtue and the highest veneration for the chevalier des essars yet was greatly surprised when he was informed of the circumstances of mariannes deposition concerning the chevaliers passion for his daughter he resolved to get some explanation of this matter from him for which purpose he went alone to visit him one day and entering immediately upon the point he told him that the only circumstance which made his daughters innocence doubtful were the violent presumptions formed against her by the judges on account of the passion he was said to have entertained for her and which was proved by the depositions of the counts brother and her woman  the chevalier was in some little confusion at this discourse he blushed and cast down his eyes for a few moments he was silent and in terrible uneasiness the old marquis in great agitations pressed him to speak the chevalier disdained a lie reassuring himself therefore in a moment he replied with that confidence which is always the companion of innocence and rectitude of mind  it is true my lord i do love the countess of berci your daughter i loved her before i knew her unfortunate lord whose death you cannot more sincerely lament than i do her beauty charmed me while i was yet ignorant of her being married and when i knew it her wisdom and virtue rivetted my chains she might possibly have been ignorant of this passion till now had i not discovered it by my complaints in the forest of beauplan i did not imagine i could be overheard amidst the solitude of that vast forest i freely disburthened my heart and chance brought the countess and her brotherinlaw within hearing that young lord for his sisters justification ought to have remembered that i expressed the sincerest friendship for the count which my actions have since proved that i trembled lest my involuntary passion should offend the virtue i adored and that i hoped for no other reward than her compassion i acknowledge farther that i once had a private interview with the countess in the castle of beauplan she granted me this favor in consideration of the service i had the good fortune to do you i had no intention of making a merit with her by that service as you my lord well know by my solicitude to conceal my name madam de berci saw me indeed but it was to reprove me for my misplaced love she convinced me i could never hope to obtain any favor of her inconsistent with the strictest duty and tenderest affection to her lord and what is more she brought me myself to desire no other to be contented with her friendship and to aim at no higher satisfaction than the glory of serving her lord and giving her such proofs of my passion as the severest virtue must not only not condemn but approve is it possible that the judges should reflect upon the whole tenor of my conduct with regard to the count of berci yet impute his murder to me was it probable that i would take a voyage to africa in which i run the risque of being delivered up to the laws of my country which i had offended by killing the count of polan or of being made a slave myself to deliver the count from his fetters only to become his assassin did i expose my life to save his at the siege of ostend only to deprive him of it by a midnight murder when i returned into france ah my lord do me the justice to believe that i mention not these things with any other view but to clear the innocence of the countess and to defend my own honor from the unjust censures that have been cast upon it yon star that gilds the firmament is not clearer than your daughters virtue nor more spotless than her mind he who reads hearts who knows our thoughts as they rise spontaneous in the mind can witness how pure mine have been with regard to the countess your daughter ah my lord if my passion for that virtuous lady had been criminal if it had suggested base desires i should have rejoiced at the captivity of her lord and not have exposed myself to slavery to redeem him to save him from death i should not have run between him and his enemies and received the strokes aimed at his upon my own breast  dear chevalier interrupted the old marquis convinced by the force of these reasons forgive me for the necessity i have laid you under of defending that honor and generosity of which my whole family has had such striking proofs i am ashamed that i have for one moment suffered a doubt to rise in my mind concerning your love for my daughter that love must have been honorable and pure for mean and base passions could never have a place in such a noble mind  once more forgive me and allow me to hope that i have not forfeited your friendship by this trial of your goodness  the chevalier made no other answer than a strict embrace to which the old marquis had invited him as he uttered these last words by opening his arms and going toward him tears of joy and tenderness fell from the chevaliers eyes at the recovered good opinion of the father of her whom he so religiously adored but these pleasing emotions soon gave way to others caused by the remembrance of the countesss sufferings they conferred together upon what measures were proper to be taken to remove the prejudices of the judges but all their efforts were to no purpose the supposed amor between the chevalier and the countess gave every thing so black an appearance on the side of the lovers that those magistrates issued an order for madam de bercis being put to the question to force her to reveal what she knew of the assassination of her lord  when this news was brought to the family de saintsauveur the grief they had hitherto suffered on account of her imprisonment was so light to that they now felt that they thought they had never been miserable till now the whole house was filled with cries and lamentations the unhappy mother beat her groaning breast and prostrate on the ground in agonising sorrow beseeched heaven to have mercy upon her child but the unfinished prayer scarce passed her lips when the image of her daughters threatened pains rising to her tortured imagination her grief rose up to frensy wildly she rent her reverend hairs and wrung her hands casting by intervals her streaming eyes to heaven from whence she only hoped relief the young marchioness in the arms of her woman fell into successive faintings that made them tremble for her life the two marquisses de saintsauveur endeavored to console the ladies but wanted themselves the support they would have given  but no words can describe the mingled rage despair and anguish which took possession of the chevaliers soul at the dreadful news the very idea of torturing that lovely frame drove him almost to distraction he could not bear to think her ears had been wounded with the ignominious sentence regardless of his safety he quitted his retreat and flew to his own hotel where the marquis de saintsauveur and his family still resided the sight of his afflicted friends gave him up for a few moments to tears they could not speak to each other no one could bear to mention the horrid sentence the chevalier at length recollecting himself and starting as if newly awaked from a frightful dream approached the wretched mother and taking her hand with a countenance and tone of voice that darted a ray of comfort into her soul thus spoke to her  heaven madam has inspired me with a design which may relieve the countess and restore you tranquillity suspend your grief for a few days and depend upon it i will save her or perish in the attempt the old marchioness could only press his hand and by an ardent ejaculation implore the assistance of heaven upon his enterprise the chevalier then taking the two marquisses aside told them that it being now near the end of advent it was probable the ignominious sentence might be put in execution before christmas he therefore desired he would solicit the king to put off by his authority the decision of the process till after twelfthnight in great afflictions it is natural for the mind to fasten upon any thing that affords the least probability of relief the well known courage of the chevalier his enterprizing temper and the prudence and fortitude which he possessed in a very high degree gave such force to his assurances that he would deliver the countess from her confinement though with the loss of his life if that short interval could be obtained that they readily and not without some degree of hope and comfort undertook to procure by the mediation of their friends the required delay in effect the king whose indulgence for the charming sex made up a great part of his character was prevailed upon to interpose his authority to procure the unhappy countess this short relief the chevalier was overioyed and immediately began to execute the project he had formed  between the little chatelet and the bridge there is a street inhabited only by butchers whither no one comes but such as have occasion to purchase meat because it is not a thoroughfare the chevalier having long before been informed that the chamber in which the unfortunate countess was confined looked into this street had upon that circumstance laid the foundation of his design having put on a plain dress and turned up his own fine hair under a wig which served for a tolerable disguise he went very early in the morning to this little street as at that hour there was no probability that any one would come to buy provisions he walked leisurely down it to take a view of the situation of the countesss prison and observed that a grate of the chatelet looked upon a window of a house which was so near it that there was only the breadth of that street between them the grate was indeed a little higher than the window the chevalier was approaching this house when he observed that the mistress of it was employed in opening her shop the woman struck with his air and mien notwithstanding the plainness of his dress was surprised to see a person whom she concluded to be of some rank at that early hour in an unfrequented street but the chevalier did not give her time to make many reflections he accosted her with great civility and told her it was in her power to do him a very considerable service which he would not fail to reward generously and as an earnest of what he would farther do for her in case she was so good as to assist him he begged she would accept that trifle saying which he put a purse that contained fifty crowns in her hand the woman was astonished at the value of such a present which conciliated her good will even more than the insinuating person and address of the chevalier though beauty never fails to have its due weight with that sex she desired him to come in and was prudent enough not to let him stand in the shop for fear of observation for she found her interest engaged in this strange gentlemans business whatever it might be and that made her extremely wary the chevalier joyfully accepted of her invitation he followed her into the little room she led to and after prefacing his story with some praises of her benevolence which he accompanied with a salute and a gentle pressure of her hand that extremely prepossessed her in his favor for women in her low class think themselves highly honored by such sort of notice from men of the rank the chevalier appeared to be he told her that in the chatelet there was prisoner a lady who was a near relation of his that he had the management of her affairs but that she had been so closely confined for some time past that he had not been able to give her any informations concerning her process nor to receive any instructions from her all which was extremely prejudicial to her cause he assured her that the favor he required of her could be productive of no inconvenience either to her or her husband it being only to lend him for two or three days a room in her house that was opposite to the grate the use he intended to make of it he said was to convey a letter to his distressed relation to give her notice of something which was of the utmost consequence to her safety he concluded with assuring her that if god through her assistance should enable him as he hoped to justify the innocence of the lady he would give her a much more considerable proof of his gratitude than that she had already received  the populace of paris are naturally compassionate they are always ready to assist any one in the circumstances the chevalier described this lady to be in when it is to cost them nothing but when for that assistance gratuities so considerable as the chevaliers present are offered there is nothing but what may be expected from their obliging officiousness the woman won by the sum she had in hand and the flattering hopes of a much greater offered the chevalier not only that room but her whole house if it could be of any service to him assuring him she would keep his secret faithfully which the chevalier having engaged her so far in his interests had no reason to doubt she began immediately to make good her promises and conducted the chevalier into the room he desired to be shown to the husband upon hearing them there ran to see who was with his wife she was young and tolerably handsome his jealousy was awakened at the sight of a fine gentleman in conference with her and he did not fail to give some marks of his dissatisfaction but this lasted no longer than till he was informed of the occasion of such a suspected visit the sight of fifty crowns instantly dispelled the cloud on his brow and he surpassed his wife in civility entreating the gentleman to be assured that himself and all he had was at his service at any other time the chevalier would have smiled at such a sudden transition from disgust to a profusion of kindnesses but the importance of his design filled all his thought the butcher told him that the chamber which had that grate in it was the best in the chatelet where only persons of quality were used to be confined and that he believed there was at present in it a lady of distinction who was accused of being concerned with a gallant in the assassination of her husband the chevalier could not help sighing at these words but recollecting himself he desired the man with great composure to bring him the necessary materials for writing his only view being to convey a letter to the hands of his kinswoman the butcher flew to get him what he wanted and the chevalier having finished his letter fastened it to a small cord together with a little inkhorn some paper and a pen the grate was doublebarred and very close he saw it would be very difficult to throw in this little packet however he flung it several times directing it as near as possible to the mark at last it had the good fortune to enter he let go the packthread that the countess might draw it all in through this grate that unhappy lady was upon her knees just opposite to it she saw something fall on the ground and her imagination being heated with the fervency of her devotion she concluded that heaven had heard her prayer and had sent her comfort she took up the packet immediately and drew in the rest of the packthread which was hanging on the outside of her chamber the paper the inkhorn and the pen which she saw tied up all together surprised her at first for the confusion of her thoughts were so great that she could not guess for what reason those things were sent her but when she opened the chevaliers letter her apprehension was a little quickened it contained these words madam although i would sacrifice my life to free you from the smallest uneasiness yet at present i rather choose to increase your grief by informing you of the dangers with which you are threatened than lose by my silence the means of delivering you from them but ah madam how can i write the words you are to be sentenced immediately after twelfthnight your courage your fortitude your glorious resignation what will they all avail you against the cruel fate that is preparing for you but i cannot will not blot a paper which i hope will reach your lovely hands with the abhorred sentence let me conjure you madam by the heartbreaking sorrows of your wretched mother by your fathers anguish the tears of your new sister the distress of your noble brother by the affliction of all your friends who take such tender interest in your sufferings do not oppose my endeavors to set you free i am authorized by your unhappy parents to make some attempt to save you oh be not blinded by false honor to throw away a life so precious let me have your consent to deliver you and hope every thing from heavens assistance and my zeal to serve you i am now waiting for your answer as soon as you have wrote it throw it out of your grate without troubling yourself about its fate only give me permission madam to save a life upon which my own so absolutely depends     the countess read this letter with a variety of strong emotions her heart felt an involuntary transport at this new proof of the chevaliers tenderness and constancy she well knew his natural intrepidity and did not doubt but he was capable of undertaking any enterprise to preserve her that good fortune which had hitherto always attended him in any hazardous attempt seemed to promise him success in this she could not think of being delivered from that place of horror without indulging a momentary joy heigthened with the reflection that the man to whom she was most willing to be obliged would be her deliverer but this last thought gave rise to another which filled her with confusion and uneasiness she recollected that this deliverer so dear to her was in the opinion of the world the assassin of her husband if she accepted his offered services would it not confirm that horrid suspicion and be productive of dangers to both she could not bear the thought of giving such a sanction to the vile reports that were spread of a guilty commerce between her and the chevalier as the flying from her prison would do no cried she weeping let me die with the satisfaction of having done nothing to deserve the cruel censures that have been past upon me in vain she endeavored to fortify herself against the fears of death by a consideration of what she owed her honor the very idea of the cruel and ignominious torture she was to suffer overthrew all her constancy and now wholly engrossed by those terrors she resolved to suffer no more scruples to rise in her mind but rather hazard the loss of her reputation for a little time than lose it effectually together with her life she had not sufficiently attended to the force of the chevaliers former arguments against her trusting to the judgments of men which cannot but be fallible she had not time to reflect on the consequences of the step she had determined to take in that enthusiasm inspired by innocence and grief she braved her fate and only sensible to dishonor feared neither the horrors of a prison nor the threatened death doubtless her mind had been supported with the hope that her innocence would be manifested in spite of the malice of her accusers and that a short disgrace would be recompensed by a noble testimony to her honor but her situation was now greatly altered her fame was wounded deeply her punishment was certain and not far off  one reasons very differently when a danger is near and unavoidable from what one does while it is yet doubtful and only threatens at a distance the love of life so natural to a young and beautiful woman whose heart was filled with the softest of all passions repelled every other thought but what tended to her own preservation she no longer deferred taking her resolution it was to live whatever construction the world might put upon her conduct she made use of the materials the chevalier had sent her for writing and answered his letter in the following manner  i will abandon myself entirely to your generous cares and ardent desire to serve me provided that after you have delivered me from this place of horror you will immediately resign me to my fathers protection the enterprise you have engaged in is generous and noble but alas chevalier it is very difficult to execute but remember that i expect you will act with so much prudence that while you are endeavoring to preserve my life you may not endanger your own restrain the impetuosity of your courage in affairs of this nature the arts of contrivance are most wanted adieu chevalier i shall be full of anxiety till i hear from you again  although the countess had entirely gained the heart of the woman who had been put about her yet she did not think proper to impart her secret to her so soon she only told her that a friend who was greatly interested in her misfortunes had found means to convey a letter to her to comfort her under her severe trials the pleasure the woman expressed at hearing this small piece of good fortune for the countess made her with good reason judge that when matters were riper she might safely engage her assistance the chevalier mean time suffered great uneasiness and perplexity while the countess was employed in deliberating what part she should take and afterward in writing her answer the poor chevalier tortured with anxiety planted himself at the chamberwindow his eyes were continually turned toward the fatal grate he trembled lest he had mistaken the room where the countess was confined and that the letter had fallen into other hands but at length after being long racked between expectation and fear he saw a bit of paper fall into the street his heart bounded to his mouth with trembling impatience he ran down the stairs to take it up but could not come time enough to prevent a bailiff who had unfortunately entered that shop to buy some meat from seizing the paper which he was opening when the chevalier approached him and desired him very civily to give it to him saying it was a paper he himself had let fall the bailiffs curiosity to see the contents of that paper was greatly heightened by the apparent agitation of the chevalier he was a little slow in returning it the chevalier almost distracted with his fears of what might happen from such an unlucky circumstance staid no longer to entreat but snatched the paper out of his hands and run away as fast as his legs could carry him behind the chatelet on that side near the church of notre dame with all the other bailiffs who were then at the barriere and a confused rabble at his heels who cried aloud stop stop him he has killed a man this cry made several persons throw themselves in his way and endeavor to seize him but these enemies were not near so formidable as those behind he conceived he might easily terrify them by holding his drawn sword in his hand and in effect the sight of it and the chevaliers threatening looks so intimidated them that not one would venture to lay hold on him but on the contrary opened him a passage through the coaches and chariots with which the little bridge is always crowded he escaped thus from the crowd and going through bystreets he arrived safe at the house of his friend where he read madam de bercis billet with infinite satisfaction  the chevalier had not acquainted his friend with his design of delivering the countess but he now told it him together with the danger he had lately escaped monsieur la ronvere for that was the name of this faithful friend of the chevaliers blamed him greatly for his rashness and told him that he with less danger and equal success might have transacted the business with the butcher and his wife and have conveyed the letter to and from the lady safe the chevalier embraced him tenderly and thanking him for his zeal represented to him that on this occasion if he attempted to serve the countess and was discovered it might create a suspicion that he lay concealed in his house and if that happened he should either be apprehended or obliged to leave paris to avoid it either of which in the melancholy situation the countess was in would be worse than death to him as it would leave him no possibility of assisting her  but interrupted monsieur la rouvere in what manner do you propose to convey letters to her now for it would be madness to prosecute your former scheme if you return again to the butchers you will infallibly have all the bailiffs to contend with and probably the mob of paris likewise in which case a discovery of your person would be the certain consequence  i have thought of an admirable expedient replied the chevalier after a little pause i will as soon as it is night dress myself like a beggar and be so well disguised that you shall hardly know me i will creep along the street asking alms till i get near the chatelet where i will attempt two things the one is to send another line to the countess by the same conveyance as before and the other to procure if possible an interview with the turnkey of the prison and try if with the hopes of a considerable reward i can prevail with him to let the countess escape although i should spend all my estate pursued the chevalier with great emotion in this design i shall yet be too happy and too rich if i procure her liberty for which i would readily sacrifice my life  monsieur la ronvere approved of his friends scheme but in order to render the success of it less uncertain said he i think it will be necessary that i should follow you at a distance with four or five servants well armed to prevent any accident happening to you if you should be known and i would advise you continued he to take money with you to give immediately to the turnkey for you deceive yourself if you imagine he will listen to your proposals unless he is softened by the sight of that persuasive metal and it is possible that without such a powerful advocate he may seize your person for tempting him to betray his trust i think in the letter you write to the countess you should desire her to sound this man and if she finds him disposed to serve her to tell him that one of her friends designed to have a conference with him this night concerning her affairs she may likewise promise him a considerable sum which you shall fix in your letter and have it ready with you to give him in case he complies the countess will certainly have a better opportunity to enter upon this negotiation than you can have and when she has once begun you may conclude it happily together  the chevalier approved of his friends advice and waited with an ardent impatience for the hour in which he was to put his project in execution after a short dinner he wrote to the countess depending upon conveying it to her in the same manner as he had done in the morning he then put on some ragged clothes torn stockings and an old pair of shoes one of which wanted a heel and helped to give him a hobbling gate his hair was all tied up under the miserable remains of a wig that had once been fair but now looked like a darkish red a large black patch covered half one side of his face and upon the whole he was so well disguised that had he been met by his most intimate friends he would not have been known  in this equipage he set out in the evening followed at a distance by his friend and two stout footmen the chevalier was not without apprehensions of meeting with some unlucky accident like that in the morning and was grieved that he had not been able to take his sword along with him for he was armed only with a little poignard which he concealed in his breast when he  ased the chatelet he left the barriere where the bliffs sit and on his left hand entered the  street of the butchers leaving his friend and his servants to walk leisurely between the little bridge and the entrance to the street st jacques he went immediately to his friendly butcher whom he found in great concern about him they did not know him again till he spke to them and overjoyed that he had so happily escaped from the bailiffs and the mob that had pursued him in the morning they conducted him instantly to the chamber from whence he had thrown his former letter into the grate as he did this likewise with equal success he desired the countess in it to prepare the turnkey for an interview with him at nine oclock that night and to let him know that he should receive five hundred crowns in hand and a thousand more as soon as he had delivered up his prisoner  the countess whose thoughts had been busied in contriving means to facilitate her escape ever since she had received the chevaliers first letter had actually hit on the same expedient and had sounded the turnkey that very day he had listened to her with great attention and complacency but had promised nothing in particular he only expressed great compassion for her misfortunes and an inclination to do her all the service that was in his power madam de berci was overjoyed to see a second billet from the chevalier fall into her chamber she was still more pleased with the contents of it and thought it a favorable circumstance that the chevalier and herself had made choice of the same scheme to effect her liberty she wrote an answer immediately in which she told the chevalier that she would give the turnkey a present when he came with her supper as usual and make him the offers mentioned in his letter she desired him not to come to the chatelet till ten oclock at night at which hour she hoped to prevail upon the turnkey to meet him the chevalier went down into the street that he might be ready to take up the countesss billet as soon as he saw it fall he had the good fortune to secure it in his pocket without being perceived but he fell into another scrape which was much more dangerous than the adventure that happened to him in the morning  it was formerly a custom in paris on christmas eve for a commissary attended with a certain number of archers to walk through the streets and take up all the poor they met who during that solemn festival were carried by force if they would not go voluntarily to a place prepared for their reception where they were clothed and supported with the money that was found in the poors boxes in churches and with the alms given by charitable persons the chevalier as he was returning to meet his friends was met by the commissary and his guard the archers concluding the chevalier was a beggar invited him to follow them he refused and two or three of the archers laid hold on him in order to force him along with them wondering at the folly of the miserable wretch who refused to go to a place where he would be clothed and fed for a certain number of days the chevalier finding they were resolved to compel him to accept of this charity resisted them with so much strength and obstinacy that they grew weary of contending with him and left him at liberty to go where he pleased his friend who at a distance saw what passed advanced with his two servants under pretense of asking what was the matter and favored the chevaliers retreat in effect he happily escaped this danger and arrived safe at his friends house where he was soon followed by monsieur le ronvere and they read madam de bercis billet with great joy they entertained themselves at supper with the pleasing hopes of soon freeing that persecuted innocent lady from her confinement and as soon as they had supped they went to present themselves at the chatelet at the appointed hour they were attended by several servants well armed so that if the turnkey should prove perfidious they were in a condition to take revenge on him and to defend themselves against any that should offer to seize them  in the mean time madam de berci took an opportunity to speak to the turnkey when he brought her supper into her chamber she had about four hundred crowns in her purse which she divided between the turnkey and the woman that attended her she told them that she made them that present in return for their obliging behavior to her ever since she had been a prisoner and that if god was pleased to make her innocence manifest and she was restored to her liberty she would give them further proofs of her gratitude she mentioned the approaching trial she was to undergo and bursting into tears assured them that no tortures should extort from her the confession of a crime she had never committed and if she died under them she hoped justice would be done to her memory  the woman wept bitterly at this discourse the turnkey was greatly affected a lady so young so lovely of such high birth and in all appearance so innocent to be put to the torture was a thought he could not endure how meritorious would it be whispered he to the woman if we could preserve this lady from the cruel fate with which she is threatened the woman although she durst not be the first to make such a proposal was overjoyed that he had mentioned it she eagerly assured him that she would run any hazard to save her the countess observed their whispers her heart divided between fear and hope beat with unusual violence at length they approached her she waited trembling for the result of their conference judging that her destiny depended upon the resolution they had taken the turnkey addressing her with tears in his eyes urged her to make her escape and both he and the woman assured her that they would venture their lives to assist her he told her that it should be his part to deliver her out of prison provided she had any person in whom she could conside that would receive her from him at the gate of the chatelet and conduct her out of paris the countess was transported to see them enter so readily into her measures such unhopedfor good fortune made her doubtful whether she was not in a dream but recollecting herself she heedfully observed the countenances of her two friends and saw so many marks of real sorrow and tenderness imprinted on them that she was persuaded they were sincere in their professions she then opened herself more freely to them and assured them that they should have no reason to repent of what they did for her service that they might hope every thing from her generosity and gratitude and that they should be largely recompensed for the advantages they quitted in the chatelet to set her at liberty that if he was in earnest in his offers she had a friend who would that very night give him five hundred crowns and when he delivered her in to his hands a thousand more she assured him that he might depend upon this promise but that he must be also exact in the performance of his for that if he should fail no place on earth would be able to shelter him from the vengeance of her friend she added that he might make his fortune in one day if he pleased and he enabled to quit a profession which could not but be very disagreeable to one who had any humanity or generosity  the turnkey unalterably fixed in his resolution of delivering her by such great offers assured her with the most sacred oaths that he would perform his promise in the countess then showed him the letter she had received from the chevaller and it was resolved that the turnkey should give him a meeting that night in order to receive the five hundred crowns and to six the day for her escape  the turnkey did not fail to go out of the chatelet at the appointed hour and seeing two men at a little distance from the gat he concluded they must be the ladys friends who were waiting for him one of them who was the chevalier des essars advanced immediately and asked him if it was he that carried provisions into the chamber of a lady who was prisoner in the chatelet the turnkey replied he was and that the lady had sent him to confer with him concerning the means to set her at liberty the chevalier was overjoyed at these words he found by them that madam de berci had been successful and taking out of his pocket a purse in which were five hundred crowns in gold friend said he to the turnkey putting it into his hand receive this small earnest of my gratitude and depend upon being rewarded with a sum much larger provided you will tomorrow deliver your prisoner into my hands but do not deceive me added he for if you do i will take away your life though i sacrifice my own i will not deceive you replied the turnkey receiving the purse but i cannot promise you to free the lady before saint johns day my master always keeps that festival and makes a great entertainment in the chatelet to which all his friends and relations are invited they will not fail to drink deep and i hope i shall find some opportunity that evening to acquit myself of the promise i have made you to deliver the lady that promise i here repeat to you monsieur and engage at the hazard of my life to bring the lady at twelve oclock that night to the new market where you must be ready to receive her but till then you must have patience and do not attempt to convey any more letters to her for fear any thing should happen that may discover the correspondence we hold together again monsieur i beg you to rely upon my sincerity and doubt not but i will faithfully perform my promise  the turnkey then urged him to depart lest they should by some prying eye be observed in discourse together the chevalier repeating his promise of a further reward and recommending caution and zeal in the ladys service rejoined his friend to whom he related all that had passed between him and the turnkey this fortunate beginning seemed such an earnest of happy success that the chevalier resigned himself up to a joy he had long been unacquainted with he would not delay a moment relieving the anxiety of the sorrowing parents before he went to his friends hotel he called upon the marquis de saintsauveur and gave him hopes that he should behold his daughter at liberty the chevalier did not think it proper to toll them what measures he was pursuing to bring about this happy event but those few words transported them with joy they endeavored to interest all heaven in his favor by the most ardent supplications and he retired loaded with their blessings and praises  the next day the turnkey informed madam de berci of his having settled every thing with her friend and that on the festival of saint john he hoped to be able to deliver her into his hands how sweet were the hopes of liberty to that unhappy lady who had so long languished amidst the horrors of a prison she now for the first time since her entrance into that fatal place felt some remission of her grief her mind admitted a hope of once more being happy she dwelt with pleasure on the remembrance of all the services she had received from the chevalier and having no longer tyrannic duty to combat with indulged a tenderness authorized by her husbands dying command and his own exalted merit in such agreeable reflections she lessened that interval of time which otherwise would have appeared so tedious yet she was often alarmed with fears that their enterprise would be discovered and that anxiety so natural to persons in suspense sometimes damped her joy for the near prospect of her liberty and gave her up to terror and despondence  at length the day so impatiently wishedfor appeared the jailor celebrated the festival with a great entertainment as usual they prolonged the debauch to a later hour than ever they had done before which was a very unfavourable circumstance the turnkey had given notice to the countess and the chevalier to hold themselves in readiness at eleven oclock the one in her chamber the other at the new market they both were persuaded that if they lost this opportunity it would be very difficult to find another and that it would not be possible to procure a further delay of the sentence against the countess the chevalier posted himself with his friend and four other gentlemen well armed at the appointed place with such an escort they had nothing to fear from the archers if they should be betrayed and they were determined if they once got the countess out of the chatelet to kill all that opposed them rather than suffer her to be taken from them when the clock struck eleven an universal trembling seized the poor countess her heart beat as if it would leave her breast anxiously she listened to every little noise and longed with eager impatience to hear the softly treading foot of her deliverer nor was the chevalier under less agitations when he heard the important hour strike fear and hope for some moments equally divided his soul but when he found the turnkey did not appear he was almost distracted he thought his beloved countess wholly lost and in the agony of his grief and despair he was for going forward to the chatelet and making some desperate attempt to relieve her  the turnkey at length appeared but without the countess the chevalier des essars transported with rage was for sacrificing him instantly to his revenge supposing he had betrayed him the turnkey seeing the chevalier advance in a threatening posture begged him to listen patiently to him for one moment he then assured him that nothing had hindered him from performing his promise but the unexpected stay of the guests to a later hour than usual that they were now all gone and that his master was preparing to go to bed where he did not doubt but he would be soon fast asleep for he had drank deep and was greatly intoxicated he entreated him to wait patiently a little time longer when he would infallibly bring out the prisoner  this assurance calmed the rage of the chevalier and dissipated his uneasiness but the poor countess was in dreadful agonies she had counted the hour by several different clocks which she heard strike but not seeing her deliverer she flattered herself that her impatience had made her mistake the turnkey terrified by the former menaces of the chevalier was only solicitous about satisfying him without giving himself any trouble to calm the fears of the countess as the minutes rolled away her apprehensions increased yet still she fain would have persuaded herself that she had miscounted the hour and this thought left her some faint remains of hope which supported her fluttering spirits till the clock struck and she reckoned twelve at this sad confirmation of her fears a mortal paleness overspread her face her trembling knees could no longer support her weight she sunk down upon a chair and losing all hopes of liberty and of life she abandoned herselfto an excess of despair  amidst these agonies more cruel than the tortures she dreaded the turnkey suddenly opened the door of her chamber and desired her to follow him his unexpected sight had such an effect upon the countess that she fell fainting into the arms of the woman who attended her her mind tortured at first by suspense and afterward sunk in the most deep despair could not bear the overwhelming joy which the sudden transition from certain death to liberty and safety gave her she continued a long time deprived of speech and sense and in all appearance dead  the turnkey surprised at this accident and dreading the fatal consequences of it knew not what to do the woman who was likewise a witness of so sad a spectacle was so much terrified that she was for several moments incapable of giving her any assistance but after they had thrown some water on her face she gave signs of returning life the turnkey repeatedly cried to her that her friends were waiting for her that welcome sound at length recalled her scattered spirits she opened her eyes and the turnkey urging her to depart immediately lest they should be prevented fear gave her strength in an instant the woman lent her her supporting arm while the turnkey softly walked before with a light with eager though trembling stepped she quitted that horrible place when she had got without the gate she thought herself secure and now light as the wind her willing feet carried her along she hardly touched the ground and flew rather than walked to the place where the chevalier and his friends were waiting for her with great anxiety the chevalier received her with a thousand transports of joy his friend congratulated her on her recovered liberty in terms that showed the highest satisfaction they put her and the woman who had attended her in the prison and who never after quitted her into a coach they had broughtwith them and giving the turnkey the promised reward they left him to provide for his own safety and went after the coach together with the four gentlemen who had followed them in this dangerous enterprise the coach brought the countess safe to the house of the chevaliers friend where he had lain so long concealed and where messieurs de saintsauveur with their ladies were expecting her and her generous rescuers with agitations that can better be imagined than described  the countess eagerly entered the room where her relations were her sight drew a joyful exclamation from her brother and sisterinlaw who sprung to meet her her eyes with speaking tenderness returned their raptured welcomes but her feet spontaneous carried her to her mothers chair whose strong emotions had rendered unable either to rise or speak madam de berci threw herself on her knees before her and taking a hand of each dear parent as they sat close together she put them to her lips in a pathetic silence for her heart was too full to speak the overjoyed mother hung over her with tears of tenderness and transport the no less transported father embraced her as she kneeled and with lifted eyes adored the gracious providence that had restored to him his child the young marquis and his lady impatient to fold their beloved sister in their arms stood close beside her each with arms extended for the wished embrace while the chevalier and his friend extremely affected with this tender scene stood at some distance contemplating it what sweet emotions then filled the breast of the chevalier at seeing the object he had so long adored so long lamented restored by him to liberty to life and to the tender gratulations of her friends no wonder that his heart entertained a hope of being one day rewarded with the possession of her whom he had so faithfully served  when the first transports for this happy meeting were a little abated and their joy ound vent in words a thousand rapturous welcomes were given the countess a thousand blessings pronounced on the chevalier who had so generously exposed his life to deliver her nor was monsieur la ronveres kindness unacknowledged by the whole late sorrowing now rejoicing family the morning appeared ever they could be persuaded to separate but the chevalier representing to them that it might raise some suspicions if they were not seen as usual at their own hotel the two marquisses and their ladies with extreme reluctance returned home and left the countess to recruit her wasted spirits in slumbers more tranquil than any she had for a long time tasted  the countesss escape from the chatelet was not o soon discovered as they had reason to apprehend for the jailor from the effects of the nights debauch lay late in bed and when he got up was so much disordered that for several hours he could not as usual visit his prisoners to see if all were safe at length however he took his accustomed rounds when he came to the chamber where the countess had been confined and found the door open and no one within he grew pale with fear and amazement and dreaded to make any enquiries lest his apprehensions should be turned into certainties his wife having just then been informed that the turnkey had not been seen in the chatelet that day came to acquaint her husband with the news and was astonished to see him gazing wildly round the ladys chamber with all the marks of terror and dismay imprinted on his countenance  do you know cried she pulling him by the sleeve that the turnkey is fled the jailor at these words starting as from a dream sent forth a volly of execrations and tearing his hair roared out that he was ruined the lady had made her escape and the wicked turnkey it was plain had assisted her and was fled with her the wife taking in instantly all the fatal consequences of this flight entreated her husband to compose himself and to endeavor privately to discover what way the fugitives had taken and get them again into his hands it will be time enough said she to declare their flight when you have lost all hopes of recovering them you will unavoidably be turned out of your employment as soon as it is known that this accident happened through your intemperance therefore by keeping it secret you will only defer your fate a little longer if you do not succeed in your attempts to get back your prisoner and if you do you will have nothing to fear  the jailor relished this reasoning although it was very absurd for he ought immediately to have given notice to the officers of justice that the countess had escaped that she might have been immediately pursued his wife however was willing to put off the evil moment as long as she could this procrastination saved the countess as it gave her friends time to settle the method of her flight  messieurs and the ladies de saintsauveur returned to the house of monsieur la ronvere the next day as secretly as possible in order to consult with the countess and her friends upon the measures they were to take to keep her concealed they did not doubt but her flight from the chatelet was already publicly known and that she would be sought for with the utmost diligence this thought gave them great uneasiness such is the vicissitude of human passions and of affairs below hope and fear joy and sorrow succeed each other naturally as darkness to the light  the transport which the relations of the countess had felt for her deliverance now gave way to their sorrow for her departure which for many obvious reasons it was absolutely necessary should be sudden while they were deliberating in great confusion and anxiety upon the measures she should pursue monsieur la ronvere who had very prudently been in search of news that morning supposing the town would be full of the countesss escape returned pleasingly surprised to tell the perplexed family that madam de berci was either not yet missed or the jailor for considerations in which himself was concerned had certainly concealed her flight that therefore they need not precipitate their resolutions but take time to deliberate upon the course which was now most proper to pursue  the countess proposed retiring to burgundy where she might remain in safety in a castle belonging to the marquis de saintsauveur her father the natural strength of the place and the great affection all the gentlemen in that province bore her family made that appear to her the securest as well as the most decent retreat as it was not likely they would suffer any violence to be offered to her there the old marquis was of opinion that to attempt to secure his daughter by force was an insult to the authority of justice and the highest disrespect to the sovereign who would undoubtedly if thus braved by his subjects make himself be obeyed in his own kingdom in spite of all obstacles it was then proposed by the young marquis that his sister should leave france and till this storm that threatened her life and honor was laid reside in some foreign country flanders was unanimously allowed to be the fittest retreat for her the city of brussels in particular where she had a kinswoman with whom she could stay with honor this lady was wife to the ambassador from france to the archduke and had always had a great friendship for madam de berci it was therefore concluded that she should set out early the next morning with an escort able to defend her against any attempts that might be made upon her liberty monsieur la ronvere engaged the four gentlemen who had assisted in carrying the countess from the chatelet to accompany him in guarding her to the frontiers they were likewise to be attended by a good number of their servants well armed and they declared that they would not quit the lady till they delivered her safe to the ambassadress  the chevalier with eager joy seized this new opportunity of showing his zeal and ardor in the service of his beloved countess no entreaties could dissuade him from attending her in this journey and he resolved not to quit her any more till her innocence was made manifest in the eyes of all france  when it was fully determined that the countess should retire to brussels and all the necessary preparations for her journey were made they next consulted upon the measures to be taken in order to discover the author of the counts assassination by which alone she could be cleared as well as the chevalier upon whom the weight of this accusation fell the counts hint relating to marianne the conscious look he gave her her extreme confusion in consequence of it and her diabolical malice in accusing the countess were the points now discussed madam de berci listened attentively to the different opinions that were formed upon this wretchs behavior some suspicions suddenly darted into her mind mariannes scandalous intrigue with verague rushed upon her remembrance she thought she ought not to conceal a circumstance of such importance from her family however unwilling she was to discover the infamous secret and which her delicacy considered as a kind of recrimination her friends greatly blamed her for so long suppressing a circumstance of such a nature and with good reason formed violent suspicions against verague the young marquis de saintsauveur was commissioned immediately to make some inquiries after that gentleman he went to his house and was told that he was not at home the marquis asked so many questions concerning him and so artfully examined the servant who answered him that at last he learned that verague had left paris fifteen days before and was gone to pass some time in traveling when he returned to his friends with this account no one doubted but that verague was the real assassin but as they could as yet prove nothing it was judged proper to keep their suspicions secret from all but monsieur de berci who was as well as them greatly interested in revenging his brothers murder as he truly esteemed and loved his sisterinlaw he was rejoiced to hear of her escape from prison and resolved together with the young marquis de saintsauveur to go in search of the murderer and if possible bring him to justice  at length the cruel moment came that was to separate the countess of berci from her afflicted friends they had no leisure to indulge tears and embraces sudden and sad their parting was the old marquis his lady and daughterinlaw not being allowed to follow her to the coach for fear of giving suspicion pressed her each in their arms and withdrew in silent anguish at eight oclock at night she entered drowned in tears a coach drawn by six horses which waited for her at a private gate of monsieur la ronveres house all her female attendants were the woman who had fled with her from the chatelet and a young maid that belonged to the marchioness her mother the chevalier des essars attended by his gentleman a valet de chamber and a biscayan of whose fidelity he was well assured mounted their horses as did likewise monsieur la ronvere and the four gentlemen before mentioned and followed the coach at a small distance they went all out of paris by the gate of st denis and took the rout through picardy to flanders they soon reached cambray having traveled with great speed and resting there one day pursued their journey but with less haste and fatigue as they were now out of danger the chevalier finding there was nothing farther to apprehend entreated monsieur la ronvere and his friends to return to paris with all possible diligence lest if their absence should be known they might probably be supposed to have been of their party he as well as the countess expressed the highest acknowledgments for the services they had received from him and his generous friends it was with difficulty that the chevalier could prevail upon them to return till they had seen the countess safe at brussels but the reasons he urged for their departure being unanswerable they at length separated not without some tears and many affectionate wishes on both sides  from cambray to brussels the chevalier gave his horse to his valet to lead and seated himself by the countess in the coach the continual view of an object whom he so ardently loved soon banished all remembrance of his past misfortunes and left him no leisure to reflect on any of those with which he was still threatened a thousand soft emotions filled his breast but his respect for the countess whom he saw buried in a profound sadness and the regard he owed to the memory of his late friend represt the violence of his passion and obliged him to such a reserved and distant behavior as left the countess no cause to complain of him and indeed during the whole journey his tender assiduity and his solicitude and eagerness to serve her were the only indications he gave of a flame the most pure and constant that ever warmed a heart the countess was too generous not to give this moderation all the weight it ought to have her gratitude so much engaged already every hour added to the debt the tender awe so apparent in the chevaliers behavior the conscious love that sparkled in his eyes yet when they met hers reluctently withdrawn lest they should too plainly discover all that passed in his heart were such indications of uncommon delicacy and respect as could not fail of making a very great impression on a heart so generous as hers with such a mutual reserve did these two lovers pass the happiest moments of their lives the only opportunities they ever had to declare their sentiments to each other were sacrificed to delicacy and to grief  as soon as they arrived at brussels madam de berci dispatched a messenger with a letter to the ambassadors lady acquainting her with the situation of her affairs and the design she had of throwing herself into her protection that lady no sooner received it than she ordered her coach to be made ready and went herself to fetch her kinswoman from the inn she had put up at such an instance of respect joined to the affectionate reception she gave the countess made the chevalier entertain a high opinion of the merit of that lady few persons know how to confer favors on the unfortunate the highest delicacy must accompany acts of benevolence to true merit and dignity in affliction if we would not oppress that heart we intend to relieve the chevalier went that day to pay his respects to the archduke that prince received him in the most gracious manner imaginable the great actions he had performed in france and even in holland though against himself inspired him with admiration and esteem for such extraordinary valor he loaded him with favors in hopes to bring him over to his service and offered him a very considerable pension to engage him to fix himself in his court but the chevalier had too much greatness of mind to secure his safety by concessions inconsistent with the strictest honor he entreated his highness not to be offended with him for refusing the offers he was pleased to make him he assured him that although he had incurred the displeasure of his king rather indeed by his misfortune than his fault yet that he was resolved to continue faithful to him till his death but at the same time he expressed the highest acknowledgements to the archduke for his offered bounty and declared that he would be always ready to shed his blood in support of his interests uninfluenced by any reward when he could do so without violating the duty he owed his lawful sovereign  the archduke was generous enough to applaud a conduct which opposed his desires he was charmed with his disinterested loyalty and gave him public testimonies of his esteem as the chevalier conceived he had only performed his duty by rejecting the archdukes offers he did not repent of what he had done although he found himself still persecuted by his prince for henry was no sooner informed that the countess and he had retired to brussels but he sent orders to his ambassador there to arrest them both and send them under a strong guard to paris the ambassadors lady greatly concerned that she could no longer protect her unfortunate kinswoman acquainted her immediatiately with the orders her husband had received it was resolved she should leave brussels with as much expediton and secresy as possible and retire to friesland the chevalier insensible to his own misfortunes only lamented those of the countses she again set out under his convoy and they arrived safely in friesland where they hoped to remain for some time in tranquillity but fortune was not yet weary of persecuting the countess of berci her charms had not suffered any dimunition from the distresses she had been in her countenance showed indeed that her mind was not at ease but that soft languor with which it was overspread carried a secret influence that no heart could resist no one could behold her without feeling pity for her sorrows whatever they were and pity for so lovely an object soon ripened into a more tender passion it was thus that a nobleman of friesland found himself captivated with the melancholy fair one before he was aware but presuming upon his rank and fortune he was at no pains to desguise his passion the chevalier des essars had perceived it before he himself could give a name to his sentiments nothing is so quick sighted as the eyes of a lover all his confidence in the justice and generosity of madam de berci could not hinder him from feeling the most cruel torments at the thoughts of this new conquest but dreading to offend her by a jealousy so injurious to that perfect esteem she expressed for him he imposed silence upon his tongue and had it been possible would have regulated his looks in such a manner that they should not have given the least indication of the torturing anguish that preyed upon his soul  the countess was not long before she discovered the painful situation of her lover the restraint he laid upon himself in not disclosing the cause of it to her was a new proof of his respect which claimed some return she was resolved not to let him languish any longer under such cruel enquietude and was therefore the first to propose leaving friesland she alleged that the air of that province did not agree with her constitution and she desired he would conduct her as soon as possible to some place where her health might be less endangered the chevalier who did not penetrate into the countesss secret reasons for being desirous to leave friesland was excessively rejoiced that a proposal so agreeable to his wishes had first come from herself he would have been wretched had he imagined she had perceived his jealousy for although in lovers it may be considered as a proof of the violence of their passion yet in a favored one it argues some injurious distrust of his mistress which a woman of any delicacy cannot easily prevail upon herself to pardon the chevalier therefore wisely concealing the particular interest he had in the countesss leaving friesland replied calmly that he would attend her when ever she pleased and advised her to make gascony the place of her retreat he assured her that in that province there were several strong castles at so great a distance from the court that they need not be under any apprehensions of being surprised although it should be discovered that they were there he added that by being nearer their friends and estates they might avoid many inconveniences to which they were now subjected in that country  the countess approved of his advice but being resolved to take no step of that kind without first consulting her father she told the chevalier that they must defer their departure till she had wrote to the marquis de saintsauveur and received his answer it was not long before the answer they waited for arrived it filled the countess of berci with joy but it was not favorable to the wishes of the poor chevalier as he found he should for a long time be deprived of the presence of her who was dearer to him than any other person in the world  the old marquis de saintsauveur informed his daughter that the count of berci for so we must now call her brotherinlaw had left paris together with the marquis his son to go in search of verague that he himself was preparing to go to court to solicit a pardon for the chevalier des essars on account of his duel with the count of polan that he would engage so many persons of distinction in his se and use such methods as he hoped would entirely undeceive the grand monarque who had suffered himself to be influenced by his regard for the favorite to the prejudice of the chevalier when his pardon for the death of the count of polan is obtained added the old marquis he will then be at liberty to come and defend his innocence with regard to the accusation he suffers under as well as you but till this is effected i desire you will set out immediately to attend the marchioness your mother who will not be able in the grief she is in for your absence to support the additional weight of mine he then advised his daughter to take her rout through germany and franche comte from whence she might travel to burgundy with less danger of a discovery and concluded with the most affectionate prayers for her health and safety  the chevalier was greatly afflicted at this unexpected order he had been used for some time past to the sight of his dear countess almost every day the idea of a long absence plunged him into the most cruel despair yet he resolved to make a generous effort upon himself and give madam de berci a new proof of his love by obeying without murmuring the commands of her father the agonies it cost him to make this resolution were but too visible in his countenance and behavior the tender sorrow that languished in his eyes his painfully suppressed sighs the solitude he now courted to indulge a melancholy which even in her presence seemed wholly to engross him could not escape the notice of madam de berci and filled her with sympathising grief so perfect a resignation to her fathers will such a boundless respect for hers even to the loss of all his happiness touched the heart of the countess more than the most pathetick complaints could have done she resolved to neglect nothing which depended merely upon herself to calm his griefs and to enable him to support her absence after enumerating to him all the obligations he had conferred upon her family and herself she assured him that her gratitude being so much engaged by his services her heart had readily received the tender impression a passion so pure and disinterested had inspired  here she stoped abruptly when the chevalier in a transport of joy threw himself upon his knees and besought her to have compassion upon the miserable condition to which he should be reduced if she suffered him to leave her without giving him her hand let me have the unspeakable happiness madam cried he to call you mine before this cruel parting how shall i support your absence if any possibility remains of losing you if the torments i have so long endured while i languished with a hopeless passion have any claim to your pity if my fidelity has any title to reward oh soften the pangs of separation by consenting to be mine madam de berci was greatly affected with this passionate supplication but she would not leave her lover a moment in suspense upon a point whereon she herself was so absolutely determined her tenderness for a man so worthy of her utmost esteem had at all times yielded to her duty nor would she suffer it now to triumph over the care of her reputation after obliging him to rise she represented to him with her usual sweetness that a marriage solemnised in a foreign country while they were accused of the assassination of her deceased lord would cover them both with infamy that the duty and respect she owed her parents required that her choice should have the sanction of their consent and her reputation was too dear to her to suffer her to think of marriage till her innocence was as well known to the world as it was to her own heart she assured him that when they had triumphed over the malice of their accusers and that they were fully justified in the sight of all france she would follow the impulse of her gratitude and tenderness that absence should never weaken her regard for him or blot him for one moment out of her remembrance and that if the malice of their fate should make it impossible for her to be his she never would be another  the chevalier yieled to the force of her reasons and with the most tender transports received the assurances she was pleased to give him of being only his again at her feet he vowed eternal constancy madam de berci could not hide her emotion when with a respectful awe he took her hand and sealed his vows upon it with his lips while a struggling sigh seemed to rend that manly heart which was the seat of every virtue and tears of mingled grief and tenderness gushed from his eyes she hastily withdrew her hand but not till by an almost imperceptible pressure of his she showed she was not offended at the favor he had snatched and retiring to her own apartment indulged the sweetly painful emotions of her soul in tears that she had hitherto with difficulty restrained  the preparations for their journey being made with the utmost privacy and expedition the countess and the chevalier set out very early in the morning in a coach escorted by their servants well mounted and armed one of whom led a horse for the chevalier to make use of upon occasion they continued their rout two days without interruption but on the third the chevaliers gentleman came up to the coach and told him that they were pursued by six horsemen who would infallibly be up with them in a few minutes the chevalier instantly leaped out of the coach and mounted his horse leaving madam de berci almost fainting with her fears it was in vain that he protested to her he would lose his life rather than suffer her to fall under the power of her enemies so sad an alternative only increased her grief with eyes and hands lifted up she earnestly implored the assistance of heaven and collecting all her fortitude to her aid silently waited the issue of this adventure the chevalier had ordered the coach to go on while he with his gentlemen his faithful biscayan and two gentlemen of friesland waited undauntedly for the enemy as soon as they came near the chevalier knew the foremost to be the german nobleman who was in love with the countess the sight of his rival added to his natural courage all the fury that hate and jealousy could inspire the german was for pursuing the coach but the chevalier rushing in his way bid him proceed upon his peril and asked him with what intention he followed that coach the german with horrid oaths replied that he would have the lady the chevalier made no other answer than by firing his pistol at his rival but missing his aim the german and his men fired upon the chevalier and his attendants and at this first discharge his gentleman and the two frieslanders fell to the ground the chevalier transported with rage at this sight clapping spurs to his horse rushed through the midst of his enemies and coming up close to the german shot him through the head he then drew his sword and being seconded by his faithful biscayan he overturned all that opposed him the germans dismayed at the death of their master and the impetuosity of the chevalier who had made two of their companions bite the ground turned their horses heads and fled with the utmost precipitation while the chevalier and his servant galloped after the coach and never stopped till they had passed the frontiers of friesland the chevalier had received some slight wounds but those of his faithful biscayan were much more dangerous the ian they alighted at being at a great distance from any town there was no surgeon to be had and the chevalier was obliged to dress his own wounds and his servants as well as he could madam de berci was greatly alarmed for her lover but he assured her that he felt so little inconveniency from his hurts that he was able to attend her as soon as the horses had baited the biscayan indeed was obliged to be put to bed he was dangerously wounded in the shoulder the chevalier desired a surgeon might be sent for with the utmost expedition and leaving him money to defray all his expenses ordered him as soon as he was cured to join him in gascony  madam de berci and the chevalier after taking a little refreshment again entered the coach the countess gave some tears to the memory of the chevaliers gentleman for whose loss his master expressed great concern they met with no accident the remaining part of their journey and arrived happily in franche comte the countess at her lovers earnest entreaty resided eight days at besancon and then resumed their rout to burgundy the marquis de saintsauveurs castle was but two days journey from auxerre the chevaliers heart was divided between grief and joy when he surrendered the countess to the arms of her indulgent mother who received her with inexpressible transports that she was now in security was a circumstance which could not but give him the highest satisfaction but when he considered that he must soon leave her that it might be long ever he beheld her again he suffered torments which can only be imagined by those who have loved like him and like him been torn from the object of their affections the old marchioness releasing her daughter from her embraces turned toward the chevalier and in terms that expressed the highest gratitude thanked him for her safety she told him that the marquis had eight days ago set out for paris on the business he had mentioned to the countess in the letter he had wrote to her and that he would send him notice in gascony what success he had at court it was necessary for this reason as well as for his own security that the chevalier should go into that province immediately he had an uncle there who was very much advanced in years and to whose vast possessions he was heir who earnestly desired to see him as he found he must leave the countess he resolved to rush at once into his misery and after resting one night at the castle de saintsauveur he took leave of the marchioness and madam de berci and pursued his way to gascony  the marchioness who saw her daughter swallowed up in affliction omitted nothing which maternal fondness could suggest to comfort her but as her consolations were wholly applied to the misfortunes she had lately suffered on account of the vile accusation she had labored under she did not reach the bottom of the countesss grief who was pierced to the heart by the despair that was visible in her lovers eyes notwithstanding his assumed composure at parting  the chevalier full of uneasy thoughts that made him wholly regardless of his safety took paris in his way to gascony he was very desirous of seeing his friends there and arriving at charenton at five oclock in the evening of the third day after his departure from the castle de saintsauveur he rode slowly on not being willing to enter paris till it was dark a noise of some horses behind him made him apprehensive that he was discovered and pursued he turned hastily to see who they were that were riding after him and perceived four archers of the provost conducting a prisoner whose legs were fastened under his horses belly although the chevalier had but a slight view of this prisoner yet he imagined he knew the face he rode up to the archers and desired to know who their prisoner was and whither they were conducting him we are carrying him replied one of them to the little chatelet where he was formerly turnkey but we should have enough to do added he in a surly tone if we answered all the impertinent questions that are asked us  the chevalier without heeding the fellows rudeness was reflecting upon the misfortune of the poor turnkey and upon the means he should use to deliver him gratitude as well as compassion suggested to him that he ought not to let this poor wretch suffer for an action which he had drawn him in to commit and of which the countess and himself had all the benefit he therefore again accosted the archers and with great mildness represented to them that the unhappy man would certainly be hanged if they carried him to prison and you said he will then be concerned at the part you have had in precipitating his death if you will deliver him to me i will give you twenty pistoles to drink and you will bind the poor wretch to pray for you as long as he lives  we neither care for his prayers nor your pistoles said one of them who had not yet spoke and possibly it would be better for you if you were less charitable than you are how replied the chevalier a little alarmed do you intend to make me prisoner for being too charitable i do not say so replied the archer but if those by whom we are commissioned to bring this man prisoner to paris were to know your offers they would force you to declare what interest you have in his escape from justice leave that care to justice returned the chevalier who began to be enraged and at present think of nothing but delivering this man to me for i will absolutely have him i desire you will unbind him this instant and resign him into my hands for nothing since you have refused my money and if you do not comply willingly know that i will have him from you by force  the archers stared upon one another in astonishment at this arrogant speech they thought the chevalier was a madman and were more inclined to laugh at his extravagance than dispute with him for their prisoner but when they saw him fall upon them sword in hand assisted by his valet de chamber and a lackey he had brought from burgundy they prepared in good earnest for a vigorous defense the chevalier dealt his strokes with such rapidity and success among the archers that two fell immediately to the ground his servants dispatched another and the fourth fled toward vincennes leaving the poor trembling prisoner in the hands of his deliverer for whom during the combat he had offered up the most ardent prayers the chevalier ordered his valet to take off his irons and then making himself known he congratulated him upon his freedom the turnkey ravished with joy and gratitude fell at his feet and vowed the life he had preserved should from thenceforwards be wholly at his disposal  they now rode with all speed toward paris the chevalier altered his intention of stopping there on account of his adventure with the archers and continued his journey to estampes whither he arrived at the break of day he rested about two hours and then taking post with the turnkey who never afterward quitted him he arrived safe at his uncles estate which was a few days journey from bordeaux the old man who had not seen him during ten years before received him with transports that had like to have been fatal to his health he wept at the recital of the several dangers and misfortunes which had happened to him in the course of so many years and earnestly conjured him to expose himself no more to the caprice of fortune but to live with him in security and happiness  the news of the chevaliers arrival being spread over the province all the neighboring gentry came in crowds to visit him and to show their joy for his return he had the satisfaction a few days afterward to see again his faithful biscayer who was perfectly recovered of his wounds the tenderness his uncle expressed for him and the obliging solicitude of his friends to divert and please him suspended for some time the agonies of a passion which had hitherto been traversed by so many cruel accidents but we shall now leave him to enjoy a shortlived repose and see what success the old marquis de saintsauveur had at court  his impatience to serve the chevalier des essars would not permit him to delay going to the louvre the day after his arrival to solicit the king in his favor he extolled in terms worthy of the fervor of his friendship the valor and generosity of the chevalier of which on many different occasions he had given the most shining proofs he dwelt upon his unshaken fidelity when distressed and a fugitive in the court of the archduke persecuted by the laws and under the displeasure of his sovereign he had refused a very considerable pension and disclaimed his protection if he must purchase it by the smallest violation of his duty the marquis then throwing himself at the kings feet modestly reminded him of his past services and with tears conjured him to have compassion on his old faithful soldier sinking under the weight of years and infirmities and made miserable by the assassination of a worthy soninlaw and the undeserved sufferings of his daughter  to soften these calamities said the good old man grant me i conjure your majesty the pardon of the chevalier des essars for unfortunately killing the count of polan in a duel which he could not in honor or justice avoid after the attempt that was made upon his person by a kinsman of the count and by his orders he then represented to the king that the count in his answer to the chevaliers challenge had in a manner confessed the charge and therefore justly deserved the fate he had met with  the circumstances of the chevaliers combat with the count of polan had by his friends been represented to the king in a manner very different from the truth prejudiced by those reports and the tenderness he had borne to the deceased he answered the marquis with some little indignation that he had been prevailed upon to pardon duellists when their quarrel had been fairly decided by the sword but that he had never skreened assassins from justice and expressed a great astonishment that the marquis should so earnestly implore pardon for a man who had been accused of murdering his soninlaw  i do not sire replied the marquis implore your pardon for an assassin but for a man who has bravely killed his enemy in a fair fight no if it can be proved that the chevalier des essars has murdered my soninlaw i would be the first to entreat that he might suffer the punishment due to such a crime but being fully persuaded of his innocence with regard to my sons assassination i am come to solicit his pardon for a lesser offense in order that he may be at liberty to clear himself of a greater  marquis answered the king the relations of the count of polan are convinced that the chevalier killed that nobleman basely although they possibly do not believe him guilty of your soninlaws murder thus every one listens to the dictates of his own private resentment for supposed wrongs but i who am not a party but a judge in this cause will render to each the justice that is due to him  permit me sire returned the old man to represent to your majesty that no one is condemned till he has been heard in his own defense i am solicitous to procure the chevaliers pardon for the count of polans death that he may clear himself of my sons murder my daughters character labors under the same odious calumny her justification is included in that of the chevalier in this case the accused and the accusers are in a like uncertainty surmises only can be opposed to surmises but if your majesty will on this occasion follow the example of some of your glorious predecessors when in capital crimes there was neither sufficient evidence to condemn or to acquit and allow the parties to decide their cause by the sword providence and a just cause will i doubt not enable the chevalier to make good his challenge let who will be the opposer  the king was at dinner while the marquis with friendly zeal and honest eloquence was pleading the chevaliers cause among other noblemen who attended at his majestys chair was the young count of polan brother to him whom the chevalier had killed this young lord had already acquired a great reputation for personal valor the marquis de saintsauveur had scarce finished his speech when he threw himself at the kings feet and conjured him not to let the death of a brother so dear to him and who had been killed by the chevalier contrary to the known rules of duelling go unrevenged for want of sufficient proofs but permit him to challenge the chevalier to single combat  count interrupted the old marquis were it not that we are in the presence of the greatest king in the world to whom i owe an inviolable respect i would not tamely suffer you to charge the chevalier des essars with having basely killed your brother he is too noble and too generous to commit any dishonorable action and too brave to have recourse to assassination to rid him of an enemy or unjustifiable methods to overcome him laden as i am with years and afflictions this arm wants not strength nor this heart courage to defend the chevalier against so base an accusation and if his majesty will permit it i am ready whenever you please to prove with my sword that what you have asserted against my friend is false i would rather replied the young count of polan with a scornful smile meet your son than you upon this occasion but when i have done with you i will support the truth of what i have said against your son and against the chevalier des essars likewise if he dares accept my challenge  the good old marquis enraged at this insolence was going to reply with some warmth when the king imposed silence upon them both and forbid them upon pain of his highest indignation to proceed any further in this affair afterward that prince feeling the force of those arguments the old marquis urged in favor of the chevalier as well as the duty and fidelity he had shown in refusing a pension from the archduke at a time when his protection was so necessary for his safety he granted him a pardon for the death of the count of polan upon condition that he returned to paris within a month to clear himself of the assassination of the count of berci  the old marquis de saintsauveur transported with joy that he had thus happily carried his point returned to burgundy with great expedition where he had the satisfaction to find his daughter already arrived being informed by her of the particular place where the chevalier resided he sent a gentleman post that very day with his pardon which he accompanied with the following letter  i have at length monsieur had the good fortune to touch the heart of the most just and benevolent of kings by the representations i have made in your favor the bearer of this will deliver your pardon for your last duel in form there is now nothing to hinder you from appearing to clear your innocence with respect to the lamented murder of my dear soninlaw and to cover with confusion and disgrace those who have blackened your fame and that of my daughter i am not through paternal tenderness more solicitous for her justification than through gratitude and friendship for yours i would have sent my son to you with this news if i had found him after my return from court at my castle but he is still abroad in search of verague i make it my constant prayer to heaven that he may be so fortunate as to bring back that wretch with him to france do not fail to be at paris within the time prescribed to you by the king and may our meeting be happy to us all  the marquis having communicated this letter to his lady she told him that her daughter being so much concerned in this affair it was proper that she also should write to the chevalier the marquis approved of the proposal and desired madam de berci to write to their common friend which she did with great willingness in these terms  i write to you monsieur by the command of my parents but at the same time i must assure you that no command of theirs was ever more cheerfully complied with you will understand by my fathers letter which accompanies this what he has done for you at court and what is now expected from you for your own justification as well as mine i do not think it necessary to press your speedy return to paris wherever your honor and my interest is concerned i cannot doubt of your utmost solicitude be assured that my desire to see you again is not one of my least motives for being anxious for your return the many and great obligations i owe you merit all my gratitude and my tenderest esteem may my justification be also your work that my heart may openly avow the sentiments with which you have inspired it adieu  the messenger having received these dispatches and proper instructions where to find the chevalier des essars in gascony set out for that province immediately his return was expected with extreme impatience by the countess of berci but an unfortunate accident happened which produced great disorders in the chevaliers affairs the messenger was sent in a season of the year when the waters had rose very high and traveling was both dangerous and tedious as he was riding along the side of a little river which had overflowed great part of the road he perceived that the postillion was got beyond his depth and was in danger of being lost together with his horse eager to save the youth he advanced hastily to lay hold of him by the neck but the bank upon which he supported himself suddenly gave way and his horse stumbling he fell into the water and both he and his postilion were drowned by this fatal accident the chevalier was prevented from appearing at court within the time prescribed which brought on the countess of berci and himself many cruel misfortunes but let us now see how the chevalier employed himself in his retirement where he was perfectly ignorant of all that had passed at court  the old marquis des essars his uncle who was extremely rich and had no other heir but the chevalier was laying schemes in his own mind to fix him in gascony for the rest of his life he dreaded his return to court lest some new misfortune should deprive him for ever of a nephew he so tenderly loved and whose presence was so necessary to his happiness he resolved therefore to make his connexions in gascony so strong that it should not be in his power to break them and this was only to be done by marrying him advantagiously mademoiselle de genvincourt was the lady he pitched upon for a wife for the chevalier she was young beautiful and had the greatest fortune in the province she had been left an orphan in her earliest years under the guardianship of a kinsman of her father who for some time very faithfully discharged his trust he carefully applied himself to improve the great qualities she had received from nature by an excellent education the surprising progress she made in every kind of learning and the consummate loveliness of her person excited an admiration of her in the heart of her guardian which when she grew older terminated in a most violent passion his advanced age his proximity of blood his low fortunes low when compared to hers were considerations too weak to hinder him from declaring his sentiments to his ward and to solicit earnestly for her hand mademoiselle de gevincourt with a mind as haughty as ever womans was had all the courage fortitude and resolution of the most intrepid man her inclinations from her earliest youth had led her to masculine exercises and the make of her person beautiful and finely proportioned as it was fitted her for exelling in them she was so enraged at her guardians presumptuous declaration that she would have wished to chastise his insolence with her own arm for her resentments were no more feminine than her spirit with a look of inconceivable disdain she desired him to be silent for ever upon such a subject if he did not wish to feel the effects of her just indignation  the poor guardian was thunderstruck at a repulse couched in terms so very extraordinary for a lady yet he did not cease to persecute her with his addresses which so provoked the haughty girl that she resolved to set him at defiance some little time afterward he was obliged to go into another part of the province upon affairs which would necessarily detain him several weeks mademoiselle de gevincourt took this opportunity to fortify the castle in which she had hitherto lived with her kinsman and shut herself up in it with some of her friends when her guardian returned she refused him admittance and ordered him to be gone otherwise she would fire upon him and his attendants from the windows the old lover retired in despair and soon after died with mere shame and grief for the treatment he had received from his charge this affair made a great noise over all the province every one was pleased with the spirit and resolution of mademoiselle de gevincourt her fine accomplishments the charms of her person her noble birth and her great riches brought an innumerable crowd of lovers to her feet but there was not one amongst them who in her opinion was worthy of her heart  it was this incomparable young lady whom the old marquis des essars designed should give fetters to his nephew he was not ignorant of her extreme haughtiness and her declared aversion to marriage founded upon her own fondness for liberty and desire of rule but he hoped every thing from the extraordinary merit of his nephew whose fame too vast for his country had extended itself over all europe and made him the object of universal admiration and esteem he flattered himself that mademoiselle de gevincourt would be charmed with a character that so nearly resembled her own but he did not think it proper to mention his design to his nephew the sight of mademoiselle de gevincourt he justly thought would have more influence upon his heart than all his arguments or even his authority if he was inclined to make use of it not but he was acquainted with the chevaliers passion for the countess of berci and looked on it as an obstacle to the success of his scheme he was too prudent to think of reasoning him out of his love for that lady but he expected a great deal from the beauty of mademoiselle de gevincourt and therefore earnestly wished that chance might throw her in his way not doubting but the sight of so many charms informed by a mind great and noble as his own would have suitable effects upon a heart whose sensibility was but too certain  the old marquis having been taken up several days in contriving schemes to bring his nephew and mademoiselle de gevincourt together at last bethought himself of making a party for the chase which could not fail of answering his purpose when this thought had once entered his head he wondered how he could be so long before he hit upon it he went himself to invite the fair amazon for so she was called all over gascony to honor this hunting match with her presence mademoiselle de gevincourt instantly complied with his invitation she had a great desire to see the chevalier des essars of whom she had heard the most extravagant encomiums she took a more then ordinary care that day in setting off her lovely person to the greatest advantage her pride would not suffer her to acknowledge to herself that she had any design upon the chevaliers heart yet she could not help thinking such a glorious conquest would add greatly to the reputation of her charms and she neglected no ornament her hunting dress would admit of to make herself appear lovely in his eyes her habit was green velvet richly embroidered with silver a dagger the handle of which was adorned with a great number of diamonds hung in a rich scarf by her side her fair hair played in careless ringlets down her shoulders she wore a little hat with a black feather that waved over part of a forehead whiter than ivory it was adorned with brilliants which bright as they were yielded in luster to her large blue eyes in which vivacity and sweetness were so happily blended that the coldest heart must have been inflamed by their piercing rays her horse was a spanish genet white as the falling snow which she managed with a grace wholly enchanting in this equipage so well suited to the lovely fierceness of her air and mein she rode to meet the marquis des essars and his company the chevalier although plainly dressed had a natural dignity in his person which negligence of apparel could neither hide or diminish he was mounted upon a very fine horse which he managed with equal skill and gracefulness the manly sweetness of his countenance the fire that sparkled in his eyes his martial air soon discovered him to mademoiselle de gevincourt who had been at the place appointed for meeting a few moments before the marquis des essars and his company  the chevalier gazed with astonishment and delight upon an object so new and charming mademoiselle de gevincourt was not less struck with the noble aspect of our hero the company in whispers declared that they were the lovliest pair in the world and seemed wholly formed for each other the old marquis enjoyed the mutual admiration with which his nephew and the charming amazon beheld each other but the effects of this interview were vastly different in each mademoiselle de gevincourt lost in a moment that insensibility of which she had hitherto boasted and became passionately enamoured of the chevalier while her beauty enchanting as it realy was found his heart so filled with the idea of the countess of berci that it excited no other sentiments for her than those of admiration and respect the chevalier eagerly leaping off his horse was presented by the marquis his uncle to the lovely maid who lightly dismounting advanced to meet him the chevalier made her a gallant compliment which sent new arrows to her heart mademoiselle de gevincourt found a secret charm in every thing he said and did she scarce ever removed her eyes from his face superior to the little affectations and reserve of her sex she was not solicitous to conceal the favorable sentiments she entertained for him they never separated during the chase the old marquis des essars could hardly contain his joy at a success so much beyond his hopes he did not doubt but the wit and learning of mademoiselle de gevincourt would finish what her beauty had begun and entirely erase all remembrance of the countess of berci the chevalier indeed found graces in the conversation of mademoiselle de gevincourt which greatly increased his admiration and esteem of her a man of his galantry and vivacity could hardly avoid talking of love to so charming a creature whom he had an opportunity of entertaining alone he fell naturally into very passionate expressions by which however he meant nothing more than to pay that homage he thought due to a beauty so attracting and a wit so lively and poignant mademoiselle de gevincourt had been too much used to make such sudden conquests to doubt that her charms had produced their ordinary effects she listened with pleasure to the rapturous language that fell from the lips of the chevalier and although her heart was sensible of emotions it had till then been a stranger to yet she answered him with such easy raillery and a gaiety so unaffected that whatever were her thoughts they remained perfectly hid from the chevalier  the chase finished with the taking of a large stag and the company being now very much fatigued they were preparing to return home when a furious boar rushed out of a wood that was near them and dispersed both the hunters and the dogs in an instant the intrepid chevalier alone disdained not to fly he threw himself off his horse and advancing toward the boar with his drawn sword in his hand he thrust it up to the hilt in the body of the terrible beast the wound was mortal but the furious animal in his dying agonies sprung forwards and overthrowing the chevalier fell down dead a few paces distant from him the marquis supposing his nephew mortally hurt sent forth loud cries of grief and consternation he was hastening to his assistance when the fair fierce mademoiselle de gevincourt leaping off her horse flew to raise him from the ground trembling between hope and fear and all the marks of terror and grief printed upon her lovely face the chevalier was already upon his feet when the charming amazon offered her assisting hand the marquis was by this time come up to them as well as the rest of the hunters their fears were now turned to joy and exultation they congratulated the chevalier upon the victory he had gained mademoiselle de gevincourts emotions had been so visible that there was not one in the company who doubted of her love to the chevalier she complimented him as well as the rest on his valor but the changes in her fair face while she was speaking made it evident that the danger he had so lately escaped was still most in her thoughts the chevalier in imitation of melcager cut off the head of the boar and laid it at the feet of this fairer atalanta as a trophy consecrated to her beauty she accepted it smileing together with the chevaliers offer to attend her to her castle where at parting he begged permission to visit her which he obtained without difficulty but he returned to his uncle more pleased than captivated with the perfections of the lovely amazon  mean time the marquis de saintsauveur was full of uneasy apprehensions on hearing no news of the chevalier the term prescribed by the king for his appearance for which he had engaged was almost expired he was amazed that the messenger whom he had sent to the chevalier did not return he knew not what to think of a delay so unaccountable the countess of berci was in despair nothing but the most fatal accident could in her opinion be the cause of his not appearing anxiety and suspense might have suggested doubts of his love but his honor was too well known to admit of the slightest suspicion against it but fearful of her parents observations she smothered her griefs in her own breast and only silently deplored the various misfortunes to which her life was exposed  two days before the expiration of the month prescribed to the chevalier the young marquis de saintsauveur arrived at paris he had spent several months in search of verague but to no purpose and eager to see again his beloved wife he came back some weeks sooner than the time on which he had agreed to meet the count of berci at paris who had been employed in the same fruitless search on his arrival he was immediately informed of the challenge given by the young count of polan to his father and to himself in the kings presence which at the command of his majesty was not accepted the fire of youth and eager desire of supporting his fathers honor upon this occasion as well as his own would not suffer him to reflect upon the consequences of disobeying the king he sent a challenge to the count of polan who accepted it with joy they met accordingly and a vigorous combat ensued both gave proofs of great courage and skill and both were so much wounded that their attendants were obliged to get litters to carry them from the place of battle to paris the friends of the young marquis de saintsauveur did not think him in safety in that city therefore wounded as he was carried him in the night to champiegny to a house that belonged to one of them the young marchioness his wife almost dying with her fears hastened thither to attend him the marquis who was now capable of serious reflections asked her pardon for exposing unnecessarily a life that was dear to her while she mingling tears with her soft reproaches assured him that her fate was involed in his the old marquis his father losing all expectations of seeing the chevalier resolved to be at paris on the appointed day to fight with the count of polan in behalf of his friend unaccountable as the conduct of that friend now seemed to him on his arrival he was informed that his son had been beforehand with him and that he was dangerously wounded as well as his antagonist the brave old man was piqued at his sons forwardness in snatching this combat out of his hands it looked as if he thought him unequal to the task and he was apprehensive that it might be imagined his son had by his command met the count of polan in his stead these considerations although they excited some resentment in the brave old soldier yet could not obliterate the tenderness of the father he sent notice of his sons condition to the marchioness his wife and set out immediately himself for champiegny to visit him nothing passed at this interview but kind endearments on one side and submissive pleadings for pardon on the other the young marquis grew better every day and when madam de saintsauveur his mother and the countess of berci his sister arrived they had the satisfaction to find him out of danger their apprehensions and grief were now changed to joy the young marquiss recovery left them nothing to wish for but the sight of the chevalier des essars and the discovery of verague to make them entirely happy the friends of the count of polan seeing that both he and his brave antagonist were quite out of danger resolved to reconcile them to each other they flattered themselves with being able to effect this the more easily as neither of them had any advantage over the other and their quarrel was occasioned rather by a point of honor than any injury given or received the count of polan and the young marquis de saintsauveur had a mutual admiration of each others valor there is a secret sympathy in brave and generous minds which insensibly produces esteem and kindness the count of polan readily embraced an opportunity of visiting the marquis with a common friend of them both and met with a most polite reception from the father and the son the two marchionesses and the countess of berci were present at this interview which proved fatal to the liberty of the count of polan for the charms of madam de berci made so absolute a conquest of his heart that from a mortal enemy of her family he now became one of the most zealous friends to it  the count was young handsome and extremely gallant he had indeed more vivacity than wit but he possessed the happy art of saying the most common things in a manner so agreeable that his conversation by the ladies especially was always thought pleasing madam de bercis heart was too little at ease to take any delight in the agreeable livelinesses of this young nobleman who knowing his own talent took every opportunity to display those happy spirits which inspired good humor and cheerfulness wherever he came the fixed melancholy that appeared in the countenance and behavior of madam de berci repressed his gaiety which however was no advantage to him a true lover insensibly adopts the prevailing humor of his mistress be it what it will the count of polan made no figure in a serious conversation nor were his features adapted to gravity yet his eyes seemed to take lessons from the lovely ones of madam de berci he sighed when she did sympathetically and sorrow in her sweet face had such powerful influence upon his heart that losing all that fire and vivacity which so particularly distinguished him he became pensive and reserved without knowing that he was so he easily found a pretense for staying at champiegny a few days during which he lost no opportunity of seeing the countess of berci but these frequent interviews increased his flame without affording him any hope of his ever being more happy he saw her so wholly engrossed by grief that he durst not make any declaration of his sentiments he only entreated her to accept of his services on every occasion that offered to defend her innocence but he made this request with a zeal so animated with such apparent tenderness in his voice and eyes that the countess who knew too much of the passion of love herself to mistake the cause of such extraordinary emotions easily perceived the impression she had made in his heart which considering him as an enemy to the chevalier des essars rather increased than lessened her disgust  the count of polan returned to paris in a state very different from that in which he had left it he had hitherto been too successful with the ladies to leave him any doubt of making an impression upon a heart wholly disengaged the coldness with which the countess received his offers he attributed to her regard for the chevalier whose ardent passion for her no one was ignorant of the count of polan being fully persuaded that when his rival was removed he should find no other obstacle to his wishes in the heart of madam de berci resolved to prosecute him for his brothers death with the utmost rigor and sacrifice him at once to his vengeance and his love  the month granted by the king for the chevalier des essars to make his appearance in being now fully expired his pardon was cancelled and the count of polan was determined if possible to hinder it from being ever renewed he remonstrated to the king that the chevaliers guilt could no longer be doubted since he had neglected to lay hold of his majestys mercy which had given him so fair an opportunity of clearing himself he alleged that his flight was as well a proof of his crime as the terrors of his conscience for brave as he was allowed to be he would not have shunned the offered combat had he not known he had a bad cause to support the count then humbly entreated his majesty to revoke the pardon he had granted to the chevalier des essars and to suffer justice to be executed upon the murderer of his brother or at least if in his absence any one was presumptuous enough to maintain his cause to permit him to challenge him to the field and trust his vengeance to the decision of arms  the king did not think fit to grant all that the count of polan demanded but contented himself with declaring that if in the space of three weeks the chevalier des essars did not appear to answer the counts challenge or some one for him his pardon should be cancelled and his person wherever he could be seized delivered into the hands of justice he then commanded that the combat should be fought on horseback and in his presence that the combatants should be in complete armor according to the ancient custom of the kingdom of france the old marquis de saintsauveur hearing of this decree dispatched his son immediately to gascony in search of the chevalier although he was hardly yet recovered of his wound and having prevailed with the king to order that all proceedings against the countess his daughter should be stopped till farther informations could be had with regard to her husbands murder he fixed his residence at champiegny expecting with great anxiety and impatience the event of the young marquiss journey in which they were all so much concerned  the end of the third part vol i
