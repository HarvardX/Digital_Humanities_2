wieland or the transformation  an american tale  from virtues blissful paths away the doubletongued are sure to stray good is a forthright journey still and mazy paths but lead to ill copyright   new york printed by t and j swords for h caritat          advertisement the following work is delivered to the world as the first of a series of performances which the favorable reception of this will induce the writer to publish his purpose is neither selfish nor temporary but aims at the illustration of some important branches of the moral constitution of man whether this tale will be classed with the ordinary or frivolous sources of amusement or be ranked with the few productions whose usefulness secures to them a lasting reputation the reader must be permitted to decide  the incidents related are extraordinary and rare some of them perhaps approach as nearly to the nature of miracles as can be done by that which is not truly miraculous it is hoped that intelligent readers will not disapprove of the manner in which appearances are solved but that the solution will be sound to correspond with the known principles of human nature the power which the principal person is said to possess can scarcely be denied to be real it must be acknowledged to be extremely rare but no fact equally uncommon is supported by the same strength of historical evidence  some readers may think the conduct of the younger wieland impossible in support of its possibility the writer must appeal to physicians and to men conversant with the latent springs and occasional perversions of the human mind it will not be objected that the instances of similar delusion are rare because it is the business of moral painters to exhibit their subject in its most instructive and memorable forms if history furnishes one parallel fact it is a sufficient vindication of the writer but most readers will probably recollect an authentic case remarkably similar to that of wieland  it will be necessary to add that this narrative is addressed in an epistolary form by the lady whose story it contains to a small number of friends whose curiosity with regard to it had been greatly awakened it may likewise be mentioned that these events took place between the conclusion of the french and the beginning of the revolutionary war the memoirs of carwin alluded to at the conclusion of the work will be published or suppressed according to the reception which is given to the present attempt  c d e september        wieland or the transformation chapter i i feel little reluctance in complying with your request you know not fully the cause of my sorrows you are a stranger to the depth of my distresses hence your efforts at consolation must necessarily fail yet the tale that i am going to tell is not intended as a claim upon your sympathy in the midst of my despair i do not disdain to contribute what little i can to the benefit of mankind i acknowledge your right to be informed of the events that have lately happened in my family make what use of the tale you shall think proper if it be communicated to the world it will inculcate the duty of avoiding deceit it will exemplify the force of early impressions and show the immeasurable evils that flow from an erroneous or imperfect discipline  my state is not destitute of tranquillity the sentiment that dictates my feelings is not hope futurity has no power over my thoughts to all that is to come i am perfectly indifferent with regard to myself i have nothing more to fear fate has done its worst henceforth i am callous to misfortune  i address no supplication to the deity the power that governs the course of human affairs has chosen his path the decree that ascertained the condition of my life admits of no recall no doubt it squares with the maxims of eternal equity that is neither to be questioned nor denied by me it suffices that the past is exempt from mutation the storm that tore up our happiness and changed into dreariness and desert the blooming scene of our existence is lulled into grim repose but not until the victim was transfixed and mangled till every obstacle was dissipated by its rage till every remnant of good was wrested from our grasp and exterminated  how will your wonder and that of your companions be excited by my story every sentiment will yield to your amazement if my testimony were without corroborations you would reject it as incredible the experience of no human being can furnish a parallel that i beyond the rest of mankind should be reserved for a destiny without alleviation and without example listen to my narrative and then say what it is that has made me deserve to be placed on this dreadful eminence if indeed every faculty be not suspended in wonder that i am still alive and am able to relate it  my fathers ancestry was noble on the paternal side but his mother was the daughter of a merchant my grandfather was a younger brother and a native of saxony he was placed when he had reached the suitable age at a german college during the vacations he employed himself in traversing the neighboring territory on one occasion it was his fortune to visit hamburg he formed an acquaintance with leonard weise a merchant of that city and was a frequent guest at his house the merchant had an only daughter for whom his guest speedily contracted an affection and in spite of parental menaces and prohibitions he in due season became her husband  by this act he mortally offended his relations thenceforward he was entirely disowned and rejected by them they refused to contribute any thing to his support all intercourse ceased and he received from them merely that treatment to which an absolute stranger or detested enemy would be entitled  he found an asylum in the house of his new father whose temper was kind and whose pride was flattered by this alliance the nobility of his birth was put in the balance against his poverty weise conceived himself on the whole to have acted with the highest discretion in thus disposing of his child my grandfather found it incumbent on him to search out some mode of independent subsistence his youth had been eagerly devoted to literature and music these had hitherto been cultivated merely as sources of amusement they were now converted into the means of gain at this period there were few works of taste in the saxon dialect my ancestor may be considered as the founder of the german theater the modern poor of the same name is sprung from the same family and perhaps surpasses but little in the fruitfulness of his invention or the soundness of his taste the elder wieland his life was spent in the composition of sonatas and dramatic pieces they were not unpopular but merely afforded him a scanty subsistence he died in the bloom of his life and was quickly followed to the grave by his wife their only child was taken under the protection of the merchant at an early age he was apprenticed to a london trader and passed seven years of mercantile servitude  my father was not fortunate in the character of him under whose care he was now placed he was treated with rigor and full employment was provided for every hour of his time his duties were laborious and mechanical he had been educated with a view to this profession and therefore was not tormented with unsatisfied desires he did not hold his present occupations in abhorrence because they withheld him from paths more flowery and more smooth but he found in unintermitted labor and in the sternness of his master sufficient occasions for discontent no opportunities of recreation were allowed him he spent all his time pent up in a gloomy apartment or traversing narrow and crowded streets his food was coarse and his lodging humble  his heart gradually contracted a habit of morose and gloomy reflection he could not accurately define what was wanting to his happiness he was not tortured by comparisons drawn between his own situation and that of others his state was such as suited his age and his views as to fortune he did not imagine himself treated with extraordinary or unjustifiable rigor in this respect he supposed the condition of others bound like himself to mercantile service to resemble his own yet every engagement was irksome and every hour tedious in its lapse  in this state of mind he chanced to light upon a book written by one of the teachers of the albigenses or french protestants he entertained no relish for books and was wholly unconscious of any power they possessed to delight or instruct this volume had lain for years in a corner of his garret half buried in dust and rubbish he had marked it as it lay had thrown it as his occasions required from one spot to another but had felt no inclination to examine its contents or even to inquire what was the subject of which it treated  one sunday afternoon being induced to retire for a few minutes to his garret his eye was attracted by a page of this book which by some accident had been opened and placed full in his view he was seated on the edge of his bed and was employed in repairing a rent in some part of his clothes his eyes were not confined to his work but occasionally wandering lighted at length upon the page the words seek and ye shall find were those that first offered themselves to his notice his curiosity was roused by these so far as to prompt him to proceed as soon as he finished his work he took up the book and turned to the first page the further he read the more inducement he found to continue and he regretted the decline of the light which obliged him for the present to close it  the book contained an exposition of the doctrine of the sect of camissards and an historical account of its origin his mind was in a state peculiarly fitted for the reception of devotional sentiments the craving which had haunted him was now supplied with an object his mind was at no loss for a theme of meditation on days of business he rose at the dawn and retired to his chamber not till late at night he now supplied himself with candles and employed his nocturnal and sunday hours in studying this book it of course abounded with allusions to the bible all its conclusions were deduced from the sacred text this was the fountain beyond which it was unnecessary to trace the stream of religious truth but it was his duty to trace it thus far  a bible was easily procured and he ardently entered on the study of it his understanding had received a particular direction all his reveries were fashioned in the same mould his progress toward the formation of his creed was rapid every fact and sentiment in this book were viewed through a medium which the writings of the camissard apostle had suggested his constructions of the text were hasty and formed on a narrow scale every thing was viewed in a disconnected position one action and one precept were not employed to illustrate and restrict the meaning of another hence arose a thousand scruples to which he had hitherto been a stranger he was alternately agitated by fear and by ecstacy he imagined himself beset by the snares of a spiritual foe and that his security lay in ceaseless watchfulness and prayer  his morals which had never been loose were now modeled by a stricter standard the empire of religious duty extended itself to his looks gestures and phrases all levities of speech and negligences of behavior were proscribed his air was mournful and contemplative he labored to keep alive a sentiment of fear and a belief of the awecreating presence of the deity ideas foreign to this were sedulously excluded to suffer their intrusion was a crime against the divine majesty inexpiable but by days and weeks of the keenest agonies  no material variation had occurred in the lapse of two years every day confirmed him in his present modes of thinking and acting it was to be expected that the tide of his emotions would sometimes recede that intervals of despondency and doubt would occur but these gradually were more rare and of shorter duration and he at last arrived at a state considerably uniform in this respect  his apprenticeship was now almost expired on his arrival of age he became entitled by the will of my grandfather to a small sum this sum would hardly suffice to set him afloat as a trader in his present situation and he had nothing to expect from the generosity of his master residence in england had besides become almost impossible on account of his religious tenets in addition to these motives for seeking a new habitation there was another of the most imperious and irresistible necessity he had imbibed an opinion that it was his duty to disseminate the truths of the gospel among the unbelieving nations he was terrified at first by the perils and hardships to which the life of a missionary is exposed this cowardice made him diligent in the invention of objections and excuses but he found it impossible wholly to shake off the belief that such was the injunction of his duty the belief after every new conflict with his passions acquired new strength and at length he formed a resolution of complying with what he deemed the will of heaven  the northamerican indians naturally presented themselves as the first objects for this species of benevolence as soon as his servitude expired he converted his little fortune into money and embarked for philadelphia here his fears were revived and a nearer survey of savage manners once more shook his resolution for a while he relinquished his purpose and purchasing a farm on schuylkill within a few miles of the city set himself down to the cultivation of it the cheapness of land and the service of african slaves which were then in general use gave him who was poor in europe all the advantages of wealth he passed fourteen years in a thrifty and laborious manner in this time new objects new employments and new associates appeared to have nearly obliterated the devout impressions of his youth he now became acquainted with a woman of a meek and quiet disposition and of slender acquirements like himself he proffered his hand and was accepted  his previous industry had now enabled him to dispense with personal labor and direct attention to his own concerns he enjoyed leisure and was visited afresh by devotional contemplation the reading of the scriptures and other religious books became once more his favorite employment his ancient belief relative to the conversion of the savage tribes was revived with uncommon energy to the former obstacles were now added the pleadings of parental and conjugal love the struggle was long and vehement but his sense of duty would not be stifled or enfeebled and finally triumphed over every impediment  his efforts were attended with no permanent success his exhortations had sometimes a temporary power but more frequently were repelled with insult and derision in pursuit of this object he encountered the most imminent perils and underwent incredible fatigues hunger sickness and solitude the license of savage passion and the artifices of his depraved countrymen all opposed themselves to his progress his courage did not forsake him till there appeared no reasonable ground to hope for success he desisted not till his heart was relieved from the supposed obligation to persevere with a constitution somewhat decayed he at length returned to his family an interval of tranquillity succeeded he was frugal regular and strict in the performance of domestic duties he allied himself with no sect because he perfectly agreed with none social worship is that by which they are all distinguished but this article found no place in his creed he rigidly interpreted that precept which enjoins us when we worship to retire into solitude and shut out every species of society according to him devotion was not only a silent office but must be performed alone an hour at noon and an hour at midnight were thus appropriated  at the distance of three hundred yards from his house on the top of a rock whose sides were steep rugged and encumbered with dwarf cedars and stony asperities he built what to a common eye would have seemed a summer house the eastern verge of this precipice was sixty feet above the river which flowed at its foot the view before it consisted of a transparent current fluctuating and rippling in a rocky channel and bounded by a rising scene of cornfields and orchards the edifice was slight and airy it was no more than a circular area twelve feet in diameter whose flooring was the rock cleared of moss and shrubs and exactly levelled edged by twelve tuscan columns and covered by an undulating dome my father furnished the dimensions and outlines but allowed the artist whom he employed to complete the structure on his own plan it was without seat table or ornament of any kind  this was the temple of his deity twice in twentyfour hours he repaired hither unaccompanied by any human being nothing but physical inability to move was allowed to obstruct or postpone this visit he did not exact from his family compliance with his example few men equally sincere in their faith were as sparing in their censures and restrictions with respect to the conduct of others as my father the character of my mother was no less devout but her education had habituated her to a different mode of worship the loneliness of their dwelling prevented her from joining any established congregation but she was punctual in the offices of prayer and in the performance of hymns to her savior after the manner of the disciples of zinzendorf my father refused to interfere in her arrangements his own system was embraced not accurately speaking because it was the best but because it had been expressly prescribed to him other modes if practiced by other persons might be equally acceptable  his deportment to others was full of charity and mildness a sadness perpetually overspread his features but was unmingled with sternness or discontent the tones of his voice his gestures his steps were all in tranquil unison his conduct was characterised by a certain forbearance and humility which secured the esteem of those to whom his tenets were most obnoxious they might call him a fanatic and a dreamer but they could not deny their veneration to his invincible candor and invariable integrity his own belief of rectitude was the foundation of his happiness this however was destined to find an end  suddenly the sadness that constantly attended him was deepened sighs and even tears sometimes escaped him to the expostulations of his wife he seldom answered any thing when he designed to be communicative he hinted that his peace of mind was flown in consequence of deviation from his duty a command had been laid upon him which he had delayed to perform he felt as if a certain period of hesitation and reluctance had been allowed him but that this period was passed he was no longer permitted to obey the duty assigned to him was transferred in consequence of his disobedience to another and all that remained was to endure the penalty  he did not describe this penalty it appeared to be nothing more for some time than a sense of wrong this was sufficiently acute and was aggravated by the belief that his offense was incapable of expiation no one could contemplate the agonies which he seemed to suffer without the deepest compassion time instead of lightening the burden appeared to add to it at length he hinted to his wife that his end was near his imagination did not prefigure the mode or the time of his decease but was fraught with an incurable persuasion that his death was at hand he was likewise haunted by the belief that the kind of death that awaited him was strange and terrible his anticipations were thus far vague and indefinite but they sufficed to poison every moment of his being and devote him to ceaseless anguish  chapter ii early in the morning of a sultry day in august he left mettingen to go to the city he had seldom passed a day from home since his return from the shores of the ohio some urgent engagements at this time existed which would not admit of further delay he returned in the evening but appeared to be greatly oppressed with fatigue his silence and dejection were likewise in a more than ordinary degree conspicuous my mothers brother whose profession was that of a surgeon chanced to spend this night at our house it was from him that i have frequently received an exact account of the mournful catastrophe that followed  as the evening advanced my fathers inquietudes increased he sat with his family as usual but took no part in their conversation he appeared fully engrossed by his own reflections occasionally his countenance exhibited tokens of alarm he gazed steadfastly and wildly at the ceiling and the exertions of his companions were scarcely sufficient to interrupt his reverie on recovering from these fits he expressed no surprise but pressing his hand to his head complained in a tremulous and terrified tone that his brain was scorched to cinders he would then betray marks of insupportable anxiety  my uncle perceived by his pulse that he was indisposed but in no alarming degree and ascribed appearances chiefly to the workings of his mind he exhorted him to recollection and composure but in vain at the hour of repose he readily retired to his chamber at the persuasion of my mother he even undressed and went to bed nothing could abate his restlessness he checked her tender expostulations with some sternness be silent said he for that which i feel there is but one cure and that will shortly come you can help me nothing look to your own condition and pray to god to strengthen you under the calamities that await you what am i to fear she answered what terrible disaster is it that you think of peace  as yet i know it not myself but come it will and shortly she repeated her inquiries and doubts but he suddenly put an end to the discourse by a stern command to be silent  she had never before known him in this mood hitherto all was benign in his deportment her heart was pierced with sorrow at the contemplation of this change she was utterly unable to account for it or to figure to herself the species of disaster that was menaced  contrary to custom the lamp instead of being placed on the hearth was left upon the table over it against the wall there hung a small clock so contrived as to strike a very hard stroke at the end of every sixth hour that which was now approaching was the signal for retiring to the fane at which he addressed his devotions long habit had occasioned him to be always awake at this hour and the toll was instantly obeyed  now frequent and anxious glances were cast at the clock not a single movement of the index appeared to escape his notice as the hour verged toward twelve his anxiety visibly augmented the trepidations of my mother kept pace with those of her husband but she was intimidated into silence all that was left to her was to watch every change of his features and give vent to her sympathy in tears  at length the hour was spent and the clock tolled the sound appeared to communicate a shock to every part of my fathers frame he rose immediately and threw over himself a loose gown even this office was performed with difficulty for his joints trembled and his teeth chattered with dismay at this hour his duty called him to the rock and my mother naturally concluded that it was thither he intended to repair yet these incidents were so uncommon as to fill her with astonishment and foreboding she saw him leave the room and heard his steps as they hastily descended the stairs she half resolved to rise and pursue him but the wildness of the scheme quickly suggested itself he was going to a place whither no power on earth could induce him to suffer an attendant  the window of her chamber looked toward the rock the atmosphere was clear and calm but the edifice could not be discovered at that distance through the dusk my mothers anxiety would not allow her to remain where she was she rose and seated herself at the window she strained her sight to get a view of the dome and of the path that led to it the first painted itself with sufficient distinctness on her fancy but was undistinguishable by the eye from the rocky mass on which it was erected the second could be imperfectly seen but her husband had already passed or had taken a different direction  what was it that she feared some disaster impended over her husband or herself he had predicted evils but professed himself ignorant of what nature they were when were they to come was this night or this hour to witness the accomplishment she was tortured with impatience and uncertainty all her fears were at present linked to his person and she gazed at the clock with nearly as much eagerness as my father had done in expectation of the next hour  an half hour passed away in this state of suspense her eyes were fixed upon the rock suddenly it was illuminated a light proceeding from the edifice made every part of the scene visible a gleam diffused itself over the intermediate space and instantly a loud report like the explosion of a mine followed she uttered an involuntary shriek but the new sounds that greeted her ear quickly conquered her surprise they were piercing shrieks and uttered without intermission the gleams which had diffused themselves far and wide were in a moment withdrawn but the interior of the edifice was filled with rays  the first suggestion was that a pistol was discharged and that the structure was on fire she did not allow herself time to meditate a second thought but rushed into the entry and knocked loudly at the door of her brothers chamber my uncle had been previously roused by the noise and instantly flew to the window he also imagined what he saw to be fire the loud and vehement shrieks which succeeded the first explosion seemed to be an invocation of succor the incident was inexplicable but he could not fail to perceive the propriety of hastening to the spot he was unbolting the door when his sisters voice was heard on the outside conjuring him to come forth  he obeyed the summons with all the speed in his power he stopped not to question her but hurried down stairs and across the meadow which lay between the house and the rock the shrieks were no longer to be heard but a blazing light was clearly discernible between the columns of the temple irregular steps hewn in the stone led him to the summit on three sides this edifice touched the very verge of the cliff on the fourth side which might be regarded as the front there was an area of small extent to which the rude staircase conducted you my uncle speedily gained this spot his strength was for a moment exhausted by his haste he paused to rest himself meanwhile he bent the most vigilant attention toward the object before him  within the columns he beheld what he could no better describe than by saying that it resembled a cloud impregnated with light it had the brightness of flame but was without its upward motion it did not occupy the whole area and rose but a few feet above the floor no part of the building was on fire this appearance was astonishing he approached the temple as he went forward the light retired and when he put his feet within the apartment utterly vanished the suddenness of this transition increased the darkness that succeeded in a tenfold degree fear and wonder rendered him powerless an occurrence like this in a place assigned to devotion was adapted to intimidate the stoutest heart  his wandering thoughts were recalled by the groans of one near him his sight gradually recovered its power and he was able to discern my father stretched on the floor at that moment my mother and servants arrived with a lanthorn and enabled my uncle to examine more closely this scene my father when he left the house besides a loose upper vest and slippers wore a shirt and drawers now he was naked his skin throughout the greater part of his body was scorched and bruised his right arm exhibited marks as of having been struck by some heavy body his clothes had been removed and it was not immediately perceived that they were reduced to ashes his slippers and his hair were untouched  he was removed to his chamber and the requisite attention paid to his wounds which gradually became more painful a mortification speedily showed itself in the arm which had been most hurt soon after the other wounded parts exhibited the like appearance  immediately subsequent to this disaster my father seemed nearly in a state of insensibility he was passive under every operation he scarcely opened his eyes and was with difficulty prevailed upon to answer the questions that were put to him by his imperfect account it appeared that while engaged in silent orisons with thoughts full of confusion and anxiety a faint gleam suddenly shot athwart the apartment his fancy immediately pictured to itself a person bearing a lamp it seemed to come from behind he was in the act of turning to examine the visitant when his right arm received a blow from a heavy club at the same instant a very bright spark was seen to light upon his clothes in a moment the whole was reduced to ashes this was the sum of the information which he chose to give there was somewhat in his manner that indicated an imperfect tale my uncle was inclined to believe that half the truth had been suppressed  meanwhile the disease thus wonderfully generated betrayed more terrible symptoms fever and delirium terminated in lethargic slumber which in the course of two hours gave place to death yet not till insupportable exhalations and crawling putrefaction had driven from his chamber and the house every one whom their duty did not detain  such was the end of my father none surely was ever more mysterious when we recollect his gloomy anticipations and unconquerable anxiety the security from human malice which his character the place and the condition of the times might be supposed to confer the purity and cloudlessness of the atmosphere which rended it impossible that lightning was the cause what are the conclusions that we must form  the prelusive gleam the blow upon his arm the fatal spark the explosion heard so far the fiery cloud that environed him without detriment to the structure though composed of combustible materials the sudden vanishing of this cloud at my uncles approach  what is the inference to be drawn from these facts their truth cannot be doubted my uncles testimony is peculiarly worthy of credit because no mans temper is more skeptical and his belief is unalterably attached to natural causes  i was at this time a child of six years of age the impressions that were then made upon me can never be effaced i was ill qualified to judge respecting what was then passing but as i advanced in age and became more fully acquainted with these facts they oftener became the subject of my thoughts their resemblance to recent events revived them with new force in my memory and made me more anxious to explain them was this the penalty of disobedience this the stroke of a vindictive and invisible hand is it a fresh proof that the divine ruler interferes in human affairs meditates an end selects and commissions his agents and enforces by unequivocal sanctions submission to his will or was it merely the irregular expansion of the fluid that imparts warmth to our heart and our blood caused by the fatigue of the preceding day or flowing by established laws from the condition of his thoughts a case in its symptoms exactly parallel to this is published in one of the journals of florence see likewise similar cases reported by messrs merille and muraire in the journal de medicine for february and may      the researches of maffei and fontana have thrown some light upon this subject   chapter iii the shock which this disastrous occurrence occasioned to my mother was the foundation of a disease which carried her in a few months to the grave my brother and myself were children at this time and were now reduced to the condition of orphans the property which our parents left was by no means inconsiderable it was entrusted to faithful hands till we should arrive at a suitable age meanwhile our education was assigned to a maiden aunt who resided in the city and whose tendernss made us in a short time cease to regret that we had lost a mother  the years that succeeded were tranquil and happy our lives were molested by few of those cares that are incident to childhood by accident more than design the indulgence and yielding temper of our aunt was mingled with resolution and stedfastness she seldom deviated into either extreme of rigor or lenity our social pleasures were subject to no unreasonable restraints we were instructed in most branches of useful knowledge and were saved from the corruption and tyranny of colleges and boardingschools  our companions were chiefly selected from the children of our neighbors between one of these and my brother there quickly grew the most affectionate intimacy her name was catharine pleyel she was rich beautiful and contrived to blend the most bewitching softness with the most exuberant vivacity the tie by which my brother and she were united seemed to add force to the love which i bore her and which was amply returned between her and myself there was every circumstance tending to produce and foster friendship our sex and age were the same we lived within sight of each others abode our tempers were remarkably congenial and the superintendants of our education not only prescribed to us the same pursuits but allowed us to cultivate them together  every day added strength to the triple bonds that united us we gradually withdrew ourselves from the society of others and found every moment irksome that was not devoted to each other my brothers advance in age made no change in our situation it was determined that his profession should be agriculture his fortune exempted him from the necessity of personal labor the task to be performed by him was nothing more than superintendance the skill that was demanded by this was merely theoretical and was furnished by casual inspection or by closet study the attention that was paid to this subject did not seclude him for any long time from us on whom time had no other effect than to augment our impatience in the absence of each other and of him our tasks our walks our music were seldom performed but in each others company  it was easy to see that catharine and my brother were born for each other the passion which they mutually entertained quickly broke those bounds which extreme youth had set to it confessions were made or extorted and their union was postponed only till my brother had passed his minority the previous lapse of two years was constantly and usefully employed  o my brother but the task i have set myself let me perform with steadiness the felicity of that period was marred by no gloomy anticipations the future like the present was serene time was supposed to have only new delights in store i mean not to dwell on previous incidents longer than is necessary to illustrate or explain the great events that have since happened the nuptial day at length arrived my brother took possession of the house in which he was born and here the long protracted marriage was solemnized  my fathers property was equally divided between us a neat dwelling situated on the bank of the river three quarters of a mile from my brothers was now occupied by me these domains were called from the name of the first possessor mettingen i can scarcely account for my refusing to take up my abode with him unless it were from a disposition to be an economist of pleasure selfdenial seasonably exercised is one means of enhancing our gratifications i was beside desirous of administering a fund and regulating an household of my own the short distance allowed us to exchange visits as often as we pleased the walk from one mansion to the other was no undelightful prelude to our interviews i was sometimes their visitant and they as frequently were my guests  our education had been modelled by no religious standard we were left to the guidance of our own understanding and the casual impressions which society might make upon us my friends temper as well as my own exempted us from much anxiety on this account it must not be supposed that we were without religion but with us it was the product of lively feelings excited by reflection on our own happiness and by the grandeur of external nature we sought not a basis for our faith in the weighing of proofs and the dissection of creeds our devotion was a mixed and casual sentiment seldom verbally expressed or solicitously sought or carefully retained in the midst of present enjoyment no thought was bestowed on the future as a consolation in calamity religion is dear but calamity was yet at a distance and its only tendency was to heighten enjoyments which needed not this addition to satisfy every craving  my brothers situation was somewhat different his deportment was grave considerate and thoughtful i will not say whether he was indebted to sublimer views for this disposition human life in his opinion was made up of changeable elements and the principles of duty were not easily unfolded the future either as anterior or subsequent to death was a scene that required some preparation and provision to be made for it these positions we could not deny but what distinguished him was a propensity to ruminate on these truths the images that visited us were blithsome and gay but those with which he was most familiar were of an opposite hue they did not generate affliction and fear but they diffused over his behavior a certain air of forethought and sobriety the principal effect of this temper was visible in his features and tones these in general bespoke a sort of thrilling melancholy i scarcely ever knew him to laugh he never accompanied the lawless mirth of his companions with more than a smile but his conduct was the same as ours  he partook of our occupations and amusements with a zeal not less than ours but of a different kind the diversity in our temper was never the parent of discord and was scarcely a topic of regret the scene was variegated but not tarnished or disordered by it it hindered the element in which we moved from stagnating some agitation and concussion is requisite to the due exercise of human understanding in his studies he pursued an austerer and more arduous path he was much conversant with the history of religious opinions and took pains to ascertain their validity he deemed it indispensable to examine the ground of his belief to settle the relation between motives and actions the criterion of merit and the kinds and properties of evidence  there was an obvious resemblance between him and my father in their conceptions of the importance of certain topics and in the light in which the vicissitudes of human life were accustomed to be viewed their characters were similar but the mind of the son was enriched by science and embellished with literature  the temple was no longer assigned to its ancient use from an italian adventurer who erroneously imagined that he could find employment for his skill and sale for his sculptures in america my brother had purchased a bust of cicero he professed to have copied this piece from an antique dug up with his own hands in the environs of modena of the truth of his assertions we were not qualified to judge but the marble was pure and polished and we were contented to admire the performance without waiting for the sanction of connoisseurs we hired the same artist to hew a suitable pedestal from a neighboring quarry this was placed in the temple and the bust rested upon it opposite to this was a harpsichord sheltered by a temporary roof from the weather this was the place of resort in the evenings of summer here we sung and talked and read and occasionally banqueted every joyous and tender scene most dear to my memory is connected with this edifice here the performances of our musical and poetical ancestor were rehearsed here my brothers children received the rudiments of their education here a thousand conversations pregnant with delight and improvement took place and here the social affections were accustomed to expand and the tear of delicious sympathy to be shed  my brother was an indefatigable student the authors whom he read were numerous but the chief object of his veneration was cicero he was never tired of conning and rehearsing his productions to understand them was not sufficient he was anxious to discover the gestures and cadences with which they ought to be delivered he was very scrupulous in selecting a true scheme of pronunciation for the latin tongue and in adapting it to the words of his darling writer his favorite occupation consisted in embellishing his rhetoric with all the proprieties of gesticulation and utterance  not contented with this he was diligent in settling and restoring the purity of the text for this end he collected all the editions and commentaries that could be procured and employed months of severe study in exploring and comparing them he never betrayed more satisfaction than when he made a discovery of this kind  it was not till the addition of henry pleyel my friends only brother to our society that his passion for roman eloquence was countenanced and fostered by a sympathy of tastes this young man had been some years in europe we had separated at a very early age and he was now returned to spend the remainder of his days among us  our circle was greatly enlivened by the accession of a new member his conversation abounded with novelty his gaiety was almost boisterous but was capable of yielding to a grave deportment when the occasion required it his discernment was acute but he was prone to view every object merely as supplying materials for mirth his conceptions were ardent but ludicrous and his memory aided as he honestly acknowledged by his invention was an inexhaustible fund of entertainment  his residence was at the same distance below the city as ours was above but there seldom passed a day without our being favored with a visit my brother and he were endowed with the same attachment to the latin writers and pleyel was not behind his friend in his knowledge of the history and metaphysics of religion their creeds however were in many respects opposite where one discovered only confirmations of his faith the other could find nothing but reasons for doubt moral necessity and calvinistic inspiration were the props on which my brother thought proper to repose pleyel was the champion of intellectual liberty and rejected all guidance but that of his reason their discussions were frequent but being managed with candor as well as with skill they were always listened to by us with avidity and benefit  pleyel like his new friends was fond of music and poetry henceforth our concerts consisted of two violins an harpsichord and three voices we were frequently reminded how much happiness depends upon society this new friend though before his arrival we were sensible of no vacuity could not now be spared his departure would occasion a void which nothing could fill and which would produce insupportable regret even my brother though his opinions were hourly assailed and even the divinity of cicero contested was captivated with his friend and laid aside some part of his ancient gravity at pleyels approach  chapter iv six years of uninterrupted happiness had rolled away since my brothers marriage the sound of war had been heard but it was at such a distance as to enhance our enjoyment by affording objects of comparison the indians were repulsed on the one side and canada was conquered on the other revolutions and battles however calamitous to those who occupied the scene contributed in some sort to our happiness by agitating our minds with curiosity and furnishing causes of patriotic exultation four children three of whom were of an age to compensate by their personal and mental progress the cares of which they had been at a more helpless age the objects exercised my brothers tenderness the fourth was a charming babe that promised to display the image of her mother and enjoyed perfect health to these were added a sweet girl fourteen years old who was loved by all of us with an affection more than parental  her mothers story was a mournful one she had come hither from england when this child was an infant alone without friends and without money she appeared to have embarked in a hasty and clandestine manner she passed three years of solitude and anguish under my aunts protection and died a martyr to woe the source of which she could by no importunities be prevailed upon to unfold her education and manners bespoke her to be of no mean birth her last moments were rendered serene by the assurances she received from my aunt that her daughter should experience the same protection that had been extended to herself  on my brothers marriage it was agreed that she should make a part of his family i cannot do justice to the attractions of this girl perhaps the tenderness she excited might partly originate in her personal resemblance to her mother whose character and misfortunes were still fresh in our remembrance she was habitually pensive and this circumstance tended to remind the spectator of her friendless condition and yet that epithet was surely misapplied in this case this being was cherished by those with whom she now resided with unspeakable fondness every exertion was made to enlarge and improve her mind her safety was the object of a solicitude that almost exceeded the bounds of discretion our affection indeed could scarcely transcend her merits she never met my eye or occurred to my reflections without exciting a kind of enthusiasm her softness her intelligence her equanimity never shall i see surpassed i have often shed tears of pleasure at her approach and pressed her to my bosom in an agony of fondness  while every day was adding to the charms of her person and the stores of her mind there occurred an event which threatened to deprive us of her an officer of some rank who had been disabled by a wound at quebec had employed himself since the ratification of peace in traveling through the colonies he remained a considerable period at philadelphia but was at last preparing for his departure no one had been more frequently honored with his visits than mrs baynton a worthy lady with whom our family were intimate he went to her house with a view to perform a farewell visit and was on the point of taking his leave when i and my young friend entered the apartment it is impossible to describe the emotions of the stranger when he fixed his eyes upon my companion he was motionless with surprise he was unable to conceal his feelings but sat silently gazing at the spectacle before him at length he turned to mrs baynton and more by his looks and gestures than by words besought her for an explanation of the scene he seized the hand of the girl who in her turn was surprised by his behavior and drawing her forward said in an eager and faultering tone who is she whence does she come what is her name  the answers that were given only increased the confusion of his thoughts he was successively told that she was the daughter of one whose name was louisa conway who arrived among us at such a time who seduously concealed her parentage and the motives of her flight whose incurable griefs had finally destroyed her and who had left this child under the protection of her friends having heard the tale he melted into tears eagerly clasped the young lady in his arms and called himself her father when the tumults excited in his breast by this unlooked for meeting were somewhat subsided he gratified our curiosity by relating the following incidents  miss conway was the only daughter of a banker in london who discharged toward her every duty of an affectionate father he had chanced to fall into her company had been subdued by her attractions had tendered her his hand and been joyfully accepted both by parent and child his wife had given him every proof of the fondest attachment her father who possessed immense wealth treated him with distinguished respect liberally supplied his wants and had made one condition of his consent to their union a resolution to take up their abode with him  they had passed three years of conjugal felicity which had been augmented by the birth of this child when his professional duty called him into germany it was not without an arduous struggle that she was persuaded to relinquish the design of accompanying him through all the toils and perils of war no parting was ever more distressful they strove to alleviate by frequent letters the evils of their lot those of his wise breathed nothing but anxiety for his safety and impatience of his absence at length a new arrangement was made and he was obliged to repair from westphalia to canada one advantage attended this change it afforded him an opportunity of meeting his family his wife anticipated this interview with no less rapture than himself he hurried to london and the moment he alighted from the stagecoach ran with all speed to mr conways house  it was an house of mourning his father was overwhelmed with grief and incapable of answering his inquiries the servants sorrowful and mute were equally refractory he explored the house and called on the names of his wife and daughter but his summons was fruitless at length this new disaster was explained two days before his arrival his wifes chamber was found empty no search however diligent and anxious could trace her steps no cause could be assigned for her disappearance the mother and child had fled away together  new exertions were made her chamber and cabinets were ransacked but no vestige was found serving to inform them as to the motives of her flight whether it had been voluntary or otherwise and in what corner of the kingdom or of the world she was concealed who shall describe the sorrow and amazement of the husband his restlessness his vicissitudes of hope and fear and his ultimate despair his duty called him to america he had been in this city and had frequently passed the door of the house in which his wife at that moment resided her father had not remitted his exertions to elucidate this painful mystery but they had failed this disappointment hastened his death in consequence of which louisas father became possessor of his immense property  this tale was a copious theme of speculation a thousand questions were started and discussed in our domestic circle respecting the motives that influenced mrs stuart to abandon her country it did not appear that her proceeding was involuntary we recalled and reviewed every particular that had fallen under our own observation by none of these were we furnished with a clue her conduct after the most rigorous scrutiny still remained an impenetrable secret on a nearer view major stuart proved himself a man of most amiable character his attachment to louisa appeared hourly to increase she was no stranger to the sentiments suitable to her new character she could not but readily embrace the scheme which was proposed to her to return with her father to england this scheme his regard for her induced him however to postpone some time was necessary to prepare her for so great a change and enable her to think without agony of her separation from us  i was not without hopes of prevailing on her father entirely to relinquish this unwelcome design meanwhile he pursued his travels through the southern colonies and his daughter continued with us louisa and my brother frequently received letters from him which indicated a mind of no common order they were filled with amusing details and profound reflections while here he often partook of our evening conversations at the temple and since his departure his correspondence had frequently supplied us with topics of discourse  one afternoon in may the blandness of the air and brightness of the verdure induced us to assemble earlier than usual in the temple we females were busy at the needle while my brother and pleyel were bandying quotations and syllogisms the point discussed was the merit of the oration for cluentius as descriptive first of the genius of the speaker and secondly of the manners of the times pleyel labored to extenuate both these species of merit and tasked his ingenuity to show that the orator had embraced a bad cause or at least a doubtful one he urged that to rely on the exaggerations of an advocate or to make the picture of a single family a model from which to sketch the condition of a nation was absurd the controversy was suddenly diverted into a new channel by a misquotation pleyel accused his companion of saying polliciatur when he should have said pollicerctur nothing would decide the contest but an appeal to the volume my brother was returning to the house for this purpose when a servant met him with a letter from major stuart he immediately returned to read it in our company  besides affectionate compliments to us and paternal benedictions on louisa his letter contained a description of a waterfall on the monongahela a sudden gust of rain falling we were compelled to remove to the house the storm passed away and a radiant moonlight succeeded there was no motion to resume our seats in the temple we therefore remained where we were and engaged in sprightly conversation the letter lately received naturally suggested the topic a parallel was drawn between the cataract there described and one which pleyel had discovered among the alps of glarus in the state of the former some particular was mentioned the truth of which was questionable to settle the dispute which thence arose it was proposed to have recourse to the letter my brother searched for it in his pocket it was no where to be found at length he remembered to have left it in the temple and he determined to go in search of it his wife pleyel louisa and myself remained where we were  in a few minutes he returned i was somewhat interested in the dispute and was therefore impatient for his return yet as i heard him ascending the stairs i could not but remark that he had executed his intention with remarkable dispatch my eyes were fixed upon him on his entrance methought he brought with him looks considerably different from those with which he departed wonder and a slight portion of anxiety were mingled in them his eyes seemed to be in search of some object they passed quickly from one person to another till they rested on his wife she was seated in a careless attitude on the sofa in the same spot as before she had the same muslin in her hand by which her attention was chiefly engrossed  the moment he saw her his perplexity visibly increased he quietly seated himself and fixing his eyes on the floor appeared to be absorbed in meditation these singularities suspended the inquiry which i was preparing to make respecting the letter in a short time the company relinquished the subject which engaged them and directed their attention to wieland they thought that he only waited for a pause in the discourse to produce the letter the pause was uninterrupted by him at length pleyel said well i suppose you have found the letter  no said he without any abatement of his gravity and looking steadfastly at his wife i did not mount the hill  why not  catharine have you not moved from that spot since i left the room  she was affected with the solemnity of his manner and laying down her work answered in a tone of surprise no why do you ask that question  his eyes were again fixed upon the floor and he did not immediately answer at length he said looking round upon us is it true that catharine did not follow me to the hill that she did not just now enter the room  we assured him with one voice that she had not been absent for a moment and inquired into the motive of his questions  your assurances said he are solemn and unanimous and yet i must deny credit to your assertions or disbelieve the testimony of my senses which informed me when i was half way up the hill that catharine was at the bottom  we were confounded at this declaration pleyel rallied him with great levity on his behavior he listened to his friend with calmness but without any relaxation of features  one thing said he with emphasis is true either i heard my wifes voice at the bottom of the hill or i do not hear your voice at present  truly returned pleyel it is a sad dilemma to which you have reduced yourself certain it is if our eyes can give us certainty that your wife has been sitting in that spot during every moment of your absence you have heard her voice you say upon the hill in general her voice like her temper is all softness to be heard across the room she is obliged to exert herself while you were gone if i mistake not she did not utter a word clara and i had all the talk to ourselves still it may be that she held a whispering conference with you on the hill but tell us the particulars  the conference said he was short and far from being carried on in a whisper you know with what intention i left the house half way to the rock the moon was for a moment hidden from us by a cloud i never knew the air to be more bland and more calm in this interval i glanced at the temple and thought i saw a glimmering between the columns it was so faint that it would not perhaps have been visible if the moon had not been shrouded i looked again but saw nothing i never visit this building alone or at night without being reminded of the fate of my father there was nothing wonderful in this appearance yet it suggested something more than mere solitude and darkness in the same place would have done  i kept on my way the images that haunted me were solemn and i entertained an imperfect curiosity but no fear as to the nature of this object i had ascended the hill little more than half way when a voice called me from behind the accents were clear distinct powerful and were uttered as i fully believed by my wife her voice i not commonly so loud she has seldom occasion to exert it but nevertheless i have sometimes heard her call with force and eagerness if my ear was not deceived it was her voice which i heard  stop go no further there is danger in your path the suddenness and unexpectedness of this warning the tone of alarm with which it was given and above all the persuasion that it was my wife who spoke were enough to disconcert and make me pause i turned and listened to assure myself that i was not mistaken the deepest silence succeeded at length i spoke in my turn who calls is it you catharine i stopped and presently received an answer yes it is i go not up return instantly you are wanted at the house still the voice was catharines and still it proceeded from the foot of the stairs  what could i do the warning was mysterious to be uttered by catharine at a place and on an occasion like these enhanced the mystery i could do nothing but obey accordingly i trod back my steps expecting that she waited for me at the bottom of the hill when i reached the bottom no one was visible the moonlight was once more universal and brilliant and yet as far as i could see no human or moving figure was discernable if she had returned to the house she must have used wondrous expedition to have passed already beyond the reach of my eye i exerted my voice but in vain to my repeated exclamations no answer was returned  ruminating on these incidents i returned hither there was no room to doubt that i had heard my wifes voice attending incidents were not easily explained but you now assure me that nothing extraordinary has happened to urge my return and that my wife has not moved from her seat  such was my brothers narrative it was heard by us with different emotions pleyel did not scruple to regard the whole as a deception of the senses perhaps a voice had been heard but wielands imagination had misled him in supposing a resemblance to that of his wife and giving such a signification to the sounds according to his custom he spoke what he thought sometimes he made it the theme of grave discussion but more frequently treated it with ridicule he did not believe that sober reasoning would convince his friend and gaiety he thought was useful to take away the solemnities which in a mind like wielands an accident of this kind was calculated to produce  pleyel proposed to go in search of the letter he went and speedily returned bearing it in his hand he had found it open on the pedestal and neither voice nor visage had risen to impede his design  catharine was endowed with an uncommon portion of good sense but her mind was accessible on this quarter to wonder and panic that her voice should be thus inexplicably and unwarrantably assumed was a source of no small disquietude she admitted the plausibility of the arguments by which pleyel endeavored to prove that this was no more than an auricular deception but this conviction was sure to be shaken when she turned her eyes upon her husband and perceived that pleyels logic was far from having produced the same effect upon him  as to myself my attention was engaged by this occurrence i could not fail to perceive a shadowy resemblance between it and my fathers death on the latter event i had frequently reflected my reflections never conducted me to certainty but the doubts that existed were not of a tormenting kind i could not deny that the event was miraculous and yet i was invincibly averse to that method of solution my wonder was excited by the inscrutableness of the cause but my wonder was unmixed with sorrow or fear it begat in me a thrilling and not unpleasing solemnity similar to these were the sensations produced by the recent adventure  but its effect upon my brothers imagination was of chief moment all that was desirable was that it should be regarded by him with indifference the worst effect that could flow was not indeed very formidable yet i could not bear to think that his senses should be the victims of such delusion it argued a diseased condition of his frame which might show itself hereafter in more dangerous symptoms the will is the tool of the understanding which must fashion its conclusions on the notices of sense if the senses be depraved it is impossible to calculate the evils that may flow from the consequent deductions of the understanding  i said this man is of an ardent and melancholy character those ideas which in others are casual or obscure which are entertained in moments of abstraction and solitude and easily escape when the scene is changed have obtained an immovable hold upon his mind the conclusions which long habit has rendered familiar and in some sort palpable to his intellect are drawn from the deepest sources all his actions and practical sentiments are linked with long and abstruse deductions from the system of divine government and the laws of our intellectual constitution he is in some respects an enthusiast but is fortified in his belief by innumerable arguments and subtilties  his fathers death was always regarded by him as flowing from a direct and supernatural decree it visited his meditations oftener than it did mine the traces which it left were more gloomy and permanent this new incident had a visible effect in augmenting his gravity he was less disposed than formerly to converse and reading when we sifted his thoughts they were generally found to have a relation more or less direct with this incident it was difficult to ascertain the exact species of impression which it made upon him he never introduced the subject into conversation and listened with a silent and halfserious smile to the satirical effusions of pleyel  one evening we chanced to be alone together in the temple i seized that opportunity of investigating the state of his thoughts after a pause which he seemed in no wise inclined to interrupt i spoke to him  how almost palpable is this dark yet a ray from above would dispel it ay said wieland with fervor not only the physical but moral night would be dispelled but why said i must the divine will address its precepts to the eye he smiled significantly true said he the understanding has other avenues you have never said i approaching nearer to the point  you have never told me in what way you considered the late extraordinary incident there is no determinate way in which the subject can be viewed here is an effect but the cause is utterly inscrutable to suppose a deception will not do such is possible but there are twenty other suppositions more probable they must all be set aside before we reach that point what are these twenty suppositions it is needless to mention them they are only less improbable than pleyels time may convert one of them into certainty till then it is useless to expatiate on them  chapter v some time had elapsed when there happened another occurrence still more remarkable pleyel on his return from europe brought information of considerable importance to my brother my ancestors were noble saxons and possessed large domains in lufatia the prussian wars had destroyed those persons whose right to these estates precluded my brothers pleyel had been exact in his inquiries and had discovered that by the law of maleprimogeniture my brothers claims were superior to those of any other person now living nothing was wanting but his presence in that country and a legal application to establish this claim  pleyel strenuously recommended this measure the advantages he thought attending it were numerous and it would argue the utmost folly to neglect them contrary to his expectation he found my brother averse to the scheme slight efforts he at first thought would subdue his reluctance but he sound this aversion by no means flight the interest that he took in the happiness of his friend and his sister and his own partiality to the saxon soil from which he had likewise sprung and where he had spent several years of his youth made him redouble his exertions to win wielands consent for this end he employed every argument that his invention could suggest he painted in attractive colors the state of manners and government in that country the security of civil rights and the freedom of religious sentiments he dwelt on the privileges of wealth and rank and drew from the servile condition of one class an argument in favor of his scheme since the revenue and power annexed to a german principality afford so large a field for benevolence the evil flowing from this power in malignant hands was proportioned to the good that would arise from the virtuous use of it hence wieland in forbearing to claim his own withheld all the positive felicity that would accrue to his vassals from his success and hazarded all the misery that would redound from a less enlightened proprietor  it was easy for my brother to repel these arguments and to show that no spot on the globe enjoyed equal security and liberty to that which he at present inhabited that if the saxons had nothing to fear from misgovernment the external causes of havoc and alarm were numerous and manifest the recent devastations committed by the prussians furnished a specimen of these the horrors of war would always impend over them till germany were seized and divided by austrian and prussian tyrants an event which he strongly suspected was at no great distance but setting these considerations aside was it laudable to grasp at wealth and power even when they were within our reach were not these the two great sources of depravity what security had he that in this change of place and condition he should not degenerate into a tyrant and voluptuary power and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of their tendency to deprave the possessor he held them in abhorrence not only as instruments of misery to others but to him on whom they were conferred besides riches were comparative and was he not rich already he lived at present in the bosom of security and luxury all the instruments of pleasure on which his reason or imagination set any value were within his reach but these he must forego for the sake of advantages which whatever were their value were as yet uncertain in pursuit of an imaginary addition to his wealth he must reduce himself to poverty he must exchange present certainties for what was distant and contingent for who knows not that the law is a system of expense delay and uncertainty if he should embrace this scheme it would lay him under the necessity of making a voyage to europe and remaining for a certain period separate from his family he must undergo the perils and discomforts of the ocean he must divest himself of all domestic pleasures he must deprive his wife of her companion and his children of a father and instructor and all for what for the ambiguous advantages which overgrown wealth and flagitious tyranny have to bestow for a precarious possession in a land of turbulence and war advantages which will not certainly be gained and of which the acquisition if it were sure is necessarily distant  pleyel was enamoured of his scheme on account of its intrinsic benefits but likewise for other reasons his abode at leipsig made that country appear to him like home he was connected with this place by many social ties while there he had not escaped the amorous contagion but the lady though her heart was impressed in his favor was compelled to bestow her hand upon another death had removed this impediment and he was now invited by the lady herself to return this he was of course determined to do but was anxious to obtain the company of wieland he could not bear to think of an eternal separation from his present associates their interest he thought would be no less promoted by the change than his own hence he was importunate and indefatigable in his arguments and solicitations  he knew that he could not hope for mine or his sisters ready concurrence in this scheme should the subject be mentioned to us we should league our efforts against him and strengthen that reluctance in wieland which already was sufficiently difficult to conquer he therefore anxiously concealed from us his purpose if wieland were previously enlisted in his cause he would find it a less difficult task to overcome our aversion my brother was silent on this subject because he believed himself in no danger of changing his opinion and he was willing to save us from any uneasiness the mere mention of such a scheme and the possibility of his embracing it he knew would considerably impair our tranquillity  one day about three weeks subsequent to the mysterious call it was agreed that the family should be my guests seldom had a day been passed by us of more serene enjoyment pleyel had promised us his company but we did not see him till the sun had nearly declined he brought with him a countenance that betokened disappointment and vexation he did not wait for our inquiries but immediately explained the cause two days before a packet had arrived from hamburgh by which he had flattered himself with the expectation of receiving letters but no letters had arrived i never saw him so much subdued by an untoward event his thoughts were employed in accounting for the silence of his friends he was seized with the torments of jealousy and suspected nothing less than the infidelity of her to whom he had devoted his heart the silence must have been concerted her sickness or absence or death would have increased the certainty of some ones having written no supposition could be formed but that his mistress had grown indifferent or that she had transferred her affections to another the miscarriage of a letter was hardly within the reach of possibility from leipsig to hamburgh and from hamburgh hither the conveyance was exposed to no hazard  he had been so long detained in america chiefly in consequence of wielands aversion to the scheme which he proposed he now became more impatient than ever to return to europe when he reflected that by his delays he had probably forfeited the affections of his mistress his sensations amounted to agony it only remained by his speedy departure to repair if possible or prevent so intolerable an evil already he had half resolved to embark in this very ship which he was informed would set out in a few weeks on her return  meanwhile he determined to make a new attempt to shake the resolution of wieland the evening was somewhat advanced when he invited the latter to walk abroad with him the invitation was accepted and they left catharine louisa and me to amuse ourselves by the best means in our power during this walk pleyel renewed the subject that was nearest his heart he reurged all his former arguments and placed them in more forcible lights  they promised to return shortly but hour after hour passed and they made not their appearance engaged in sprightly conversation it was not till the clock struck twelve that we were reminded of the lapse of time the absence of our friends excited some uneasy apprehensions we were expressing our fears and comparing our conjectures as to what might be the cause when they entered together there were indications in their countenances that struck me mute these were unnoticed by catharine who was eager to express her surprise and curiosity at the length of their walk as they listened to her i remarked that their surprise was not less than ours they gazed in silence on each other and on her i watched their looks but could not understand the emotions that were written in them  these appearances diverted catharines inquiries into a new channel what did they mean she asked by their silence and by their thus gazing wildly at each other and at her pleyel profited by this hint and assuming an air of indifference framed some trifling excuse at the same time darting significant glances at wieland as if to caution him against disclosing the truth my brother said nothing but delivered himself up to meditation i likewise was silent but burned with impatience to fathom this mystery presently my brother and his wife and louisa returned home pleyel proposed of his own accord to be my guest for the night this circumstance in addition to those which preceded gave new edge to my wonder  as soon as we were left alone pleyels countenance assumed an air of seriousness and even consternation which i had never before beheld in him the steps with which he measured the floor betokened the trouble of his thoughts my inquiries were suspended by the hope that he would give me the information that i wanted without the importunity of questions i waited some time but the confusion of his thoughts appeared in no degree to abate at length i mentioned the apprehensions which their unusual absence had occasioned and which were increased by their behavior since their return and solicited an explanation he stopped when i began to speak and looked steadfastly at me when i had done he said to me in a tone which faultered through the vehemence of his emotions how were you employed during our absence in turning over the della crusca dictionary and talking on different subjects but just before your entrance we were tormenting ourselves with omens and prognostics relative to your absence catharine was with you the whole time yes but are you sure most sure she was not absent a moment he stood for a time as if to assure himself of my sincerity then clenching his hands and wildly lifting them above his head lo cried he i have news to tell you the baroness de stolberg is dead  this was her whom he loved i was not surprised at the agitations which he betrayed but how was the information procured how was the truth of this news connected with the circumstance of catharines remaining in our company he was for some time inattentive to my questions when he spoke it seemed merely a continuation of the reverie into which he had been plunged  and yet it might be a mere deception but could both of us in that case have been deceived a rare and prodigious coincidence barely not impossible and yet if the accent be oracular  theresa is dead no no continued he covering his face with his hands and in a tone half broken into sobs i cannot believe it she has not written but if she were dead the faithful bertrand would have given me the earliest information and yet if he knew his master he must have easily guessed at the effect of such tidings in pity to me he was silent  clara forgive me to you this behavior is mysterious i will explain as well as i am able but say not a word to catharine her strength of mind is inferior to yours she will besides have more reason to be startled she is wielands angel  pleyel proceeded to inform me for the first time of the scheme which he had pressed with so much earnestness on my brother he enumerated the objections which had been made and the industry with which he had endeavored to confute them he mentioned the effect upon his resolutions produced by the failure of a letter during our late walk continued he i introduced the subject that was nearest my heart i reurged all my former arguments and placed them in more forcible lights wieland was still refractory he expatiated on the perils of wealth and power on the sacredness of conjugal and parental duties and the happiness of mediocrity  no wonder that the time passed unperceived away our whole souls were engaged in this cause several times we came to the foot of the rock as soon as we perceived it we changed our course but never failed to terminate our circuitous and devious ramble at this spot at length your brother observed we seem to be led hither by a kind of fatality since we are so near let us ascend and rest ourselves a while if you are not weary of this argument we will resume it there  i tacitly consented we mounted the stairs and drawing the sofa in front of the river we seated ourselves upon it i took up the thread of our discourse where we had dropped it i ridiculed his dread of the sea and his attachment to home i kept on in this strain so congenial with my disposition for some time uninterrupted by him at length he said to me suppose now that i whom argument has not convinced should yield to ridicule and should agree that your scheme is eligible what will you have gained nothing you have other enemies beside myself to encounter when you have vanquished me your toil has scarcely begun there are my sister and wife with whom it will remain for you to maintain the contest and trust me they are adversaries whom all your force and stratagem will never subdue i insinuated that they would model themselves by his will that catharine would think obedience her duty he answered with some quickness you mistake their concurrence is indispensable it is not my custom to exact sacrifices of this kind i live to be their protector and friend and not their tyrant and foe if my wife shall deem her happiness and that of her children most consulted by remaining where she is here she shall remain but said i when she knows your pleasure will she not conform to it before my friend had time to answer this question a negative was clearly and distinctly uttered from another quarter it did not come from one side or the other from before us or behind whence then did it come by whose organs was it fashioned  if any uncertainty had existed with regard to these particulars it would have been removed by a deliberate and equally distinct repetition of the same monosyllable no the voice was my sisters it appeared to come from the roof i started from my seat catharine exclaimed i where are you no answer was returned i searched the room and the area before it but in vain your brother was motionless in his seat i returned to him and placedmyself again by his side my astonishment was not less than his  well said he at length what think you of this this is the selfsame voice which i formerly heard you are now convinced that my ears were well informed  yes said i this it is plain is no fiction of the fancy we again sunk into mutual and thoughtful silence a recollection of the hour and of the length of our absence made me at last propose to return we rose up for this purpose in doing this my mind reverted to the contemplation of my own condition yes said i aloud but without particularly addressing myself to wieland my resolution is taken i cannot hope to prevail with my friends to accompany me they may doze away their days on the banks of schuylkill but as to me i go in the next vessel i will fly to her presence and demand the reason of this extraordinary silence  i had scarcely finished the sentence when the same mysterious voice exclaimed you shall not go the seal of death is on her lips her silence is the silence of the tomb think of the effects which accents like these must have had upon me i shuddered as i listened as soon as i recovered from my first amazement who is it that speaks said i whence did you procure these dismal tidings i did not wait long for an answer from a source that cannot fail be satisfied she is dead you may justly be surprised that in the circumstances in which i heard the tidings and notwithstanding the mystery which environed him by whom they were imparted i could give an undivided attention to the facts which were the subject of our dialogue i eagerly inquired when and where did she die what was the cause of her death was her death absolutely certain an answer was returned only to the last of these questions yes was pronounced by the same voice but it now sounded from a greater distance and the deepest silence was all the return made to my subsequent interrogatories  it was my sisters voice but it could not be uttered by her and yet if not by her by whom was it uttered when we returned hither and discovered you together the doubt that had previously existed was removed it was manifest that the intimation came not from her yet if not from her from whom could it come are the circumstances attending the imparting of this news proof that the tidings are true god forbid that they should be true  here pleyel sunk into anxious silence and gave me leisure to ruminate on this inexplicable event i am at a loss to describe the sensations that affected me i am not fearful of shadows the tales of apparitions and enchantments did not possess that power over my belief which could even render them interesting i saw nothing in them but ignorance and folly and was a stranger even to that terror which is pleasing but this incident was different from any that i had ever before known here were proofs of a sensible and intelligent existence which could not be denied here was information obtained and imparted by means unquestionably superhuman  that there are conscious beings beside ourselves in existence whose modes of activity and information surpass our own can scarcely be denied is there a glimpse afforded us into a world of these superior beings my heart was scarcely large enough to give admittance to so swelling a thought an awe the sweetest and most solemn that imagination can conceive pervaded my whole frame it forsook me not when i parted from pleyel and retired to my chamber an impulse was given to my spirits utterly incompatible with sleep i passed the night wakeful and full of meditation i was impressed with the belief of mysterious but not of malignant agency hitherto nothing had occurred to persuade me that this airy minister was busy to evil rather than to good purposes on the contrary the idea of superior virtue had always been associated in my mi with that of superior power the warnings that hd thus been heard appeared to have been prompted by beneficent intentions my brother had been hindered by this voice from ascending the hill he was told that danger lurked in his path and his obedience to the intimation had perhaps saved him from a destiny similar to that of my father  pleyel had been rescued from tormenting uncertainty and from the hazards and fatigues of a fruitless voyage by the same interposition it had assured him of the death of his theresa  this woman was then dead a confirmation of the tidings if true would speedily arrive was this confirmation to be deprecated or desired by her death the tie that attached him to europe was taken away henceforward every motive would combine to retain him in his native country and we were rescued from the deep regrets that would accompany his hopeless absence from us propitious was the spirit that imparted these tidings propitious he would perhaps have been if he had been instrumental in producing as well as in communicating the tidings of her death propitious to us the friends of pleyel to whom has thereby been secured the enjoyment of his society and not unpropitious to himself for though this object of his love be snatched away is there not another who is able and willing to console him for her loss  twenty days after this another vessel arrived from the same port in this interval pleyel for the most part estranged himself from his old companions he was become the prey of a gloomy and unsociable grief his walks were limited to the bank of the delaware this bank is an artificial one reeds and the river are on one side and a watery marsh on the other in that part which bounded his lands and which extended from the mouth of hollanders creek to that of schuylkill no scene can be imagined less enticing to a lover of the picturesque than this the shore is deformed with mud and incumbered with a forest of reeds the fields in most seasons are mire but when they afford a firm footing the ditches by which they are bounded and intersected are mantled with stagnating green and emit the most noxious exhalations health is no less a stranger to those seats than pleasure spring and autumn are sure to be accompanied with agues and bilious remittents  the scenes which environed our dwellings at mettingen constituted the reverse of this schuylkill was here a pure and translucid current broken into wild and ceaseless music by rocky points murmuring on a sandy margin and reflecting on its surface banks of all varieties of height and degrees of declivity these banks were chequered by patches of dark verdure and shapeless masses of white marble and crowned by copses of cedar or by the regular magnificence of orchards which at this season were in blossom and were prodigal of odours the ground which receded from the river was scooped into valleys and dales its beauties were enhanced by the horticultural skill of my brother who bedecked this exquisite assemblage of slopes and risings with every species of vegetable ornament from the giant arms of the oak to the clustering tendrils of the honeysuckle  to screen him from the unwholesome airs of his own residence it had been proposed to pleyel to spend the months of spring with us he had apparently acquiesced in this proposal but the late event induced him to change his purpose he was only to be seen by visiting him in his retirements his gaiety had flown and every passion was absorbed in eagerness to procure tidings from saxony i have mentioned the arrival of another vessel from the elbe he descried her early one morning as he was passing along the skirt of the river she was easily recognized being the ship in which he had performed his first voyage to germany he immediately went on board but found no letters directed to him this omission was in some degree compensated by meeting with an old acquaintance among the passengers who had till lately been a resident in leipsig this person put an end to all suspense respecting the fate of theresa by relating the particulars of her death and funeral  thus was the truth of the former intimation attested no longer devoured by suspense the grief of pleyel was not long in yielding to the influence of society he gave himself up once more to our company his vivacity had indeed been damped but even in this respect he was a more acceptable companion than formerly since his seriousness was neither incommunicative nor sullen  these incidents for a time occupied all our thoughts in me they produced a sentiment not unallied to pleasure and more speedily than in the case of my friends were intermixed with other topics my brother was particularly affected by them it was easy to perceive that most of his meditations were tinctured from this source to this was to be ascribed a design in which his pen was at this period engaged of collecting and investigating the facts which relate to that mysterious personage the demon of socrates  my brothers skill in greek and roman learning was exceeded by that of few and no doubt the world would have accepted a treatise upon this subject from his hand with avidity but alas this and every other scheme of felicity and honor were doomed to sudden blast and hopeless extermination  chapter vi i now come to the mention of a person with whose name the most turbulent sensations are connected it is with a shuddering reluctance that i enter on the province of describing him now it is that i begin to perceive the difficulty of the task which i have undertaken but it would be weakness to shrink from it my blood is congealed and my fingers are palsied when i call up his image shame upon my cowardly and infirm heart hitherto i have proceeded with some degree of composure but now i must pause i mean not that dire remembrance shall subdue my courage or baffle my design but this weakness cannot be immediately conquered i must desist for a little while  i have taken a few turns in my chamber and have gathered strength enough to proceed yet have i not projected a task beyond my power to execute if thus on the very threshold of the scene my knees faulter and i sink how shall i support myself when i rush into the midst of horrors such as no heart has hitherto conceived nor tongue related i sicken and recoil at the prospect and yet my irresolution is momentary i have not formed this design upon slight grounds and though i may at times pause and hesitate i will not be finally diverted from it  and thou o most fatal and potent of mankind in what terms shall i describe thee what words are adequate to the just delineation of thy character how shall i detail the means which rendered the secrecy of thy purposes unfathomable but i will not anticipate let me recover if possible a sober strain let me keep down the flood of passion that would render me precipitate or powerless let me stifle the agonies that are awakened by thy name let me for a time regard thee as a being of no terrible attributes let me tear myself from contemplation of the evils of which it is but too certain that thou wast the author and limit my view to those harmless appearances which attended thy entrance on the stage  one sunny afternoon i was standing in the door of my house when i marked a person passing close to the edge of the bank that was in front his pace was a careless and lingering one and had none of that gracefulness and ease which distinguish a person with certain advantages of education from a clown his gait was rustic and awkward his form was ungainly and disproportioned shoulders broad and square breast sunken his head drooping his body of uniform breadth supported by long and lank legs were the ingredients of his frame his garb was not ill adapted to such a figure a slouched hat tarnished by the weather a coat of thick gray cloth cut and wrought as it seemed by a country tailor blue worsted stockings and shoes fastened by thongs and deeply discolored by dust which brush had never disturbed constituted his dress  there was nothing remarkable in these appearances they were frequently to be met with on the road and in the harverst field i cannot tell why i gazed upon them on this occasion with more than ordinary attention unless it were that such figures were seldom seen by me except on the road or field this lawn was only traversed by men whose views were directed to the pleasures of the walk or the grandeur of the scenery  he passed slowly along frequently pausing as if to examine the prospect more deliberately but never turning his eye toward the house so as to allow me a view of his countenance presently he entered a copse at a small distance and disappeared my eye followed him while he remained in sight if his image remained for any duration in my fancy after his departure it was because no other object occurred sufficient to expel it  i continued in the same spot for half an hour vaguely and by fits contemplating the image of this wanderer and drawing from outward appearances those inferences with respect to the intellectual history of this person which experience affords us i reflected on the alliance which commonly subsists between ignorance and the practice of agriculture and indulged myself in airy speculations as to the influence of progressive knowledge in dissolving this alliance and embodying the dreams of the poets i asked why the plough and the hoe might not become the trade of every human being and how this trade might be made conducive to or at least consistent with the acquisition of wisdom and eloquence  weary with these reflections i returned to the kitchen to perform some household office i had usually but one servant and she was a girl about my own age i was busy near the chimney and she was employed near the door of the apartment when some one knocked the door was opened by her and she was immediately addressed with prythee good girl can thou supply a thirsty man with a glass of buttermilk she answered that there was none in the house aye but there is some in the dairy yonder thou know as well as i though hermes never taught thee that though every dairy be an house every house is not a dairy to this speech though she understood only a part of it she replied by repeating her assurances that she had none to give well then rejoined the stranger for charitys sweet sake hand me forth a cup of cold water the girl said she would go to the spring and fetch it nay give me the cup and suffer me to help myself neither manacled nor lame i should merit burial in the maw of carrion crows if i laid this task upon thee she gave him the cup and he turned to go to the spring  i listened to this dialogue in silence the words uttered by the person without affected me as somewhat singular but what chiefly rendered them remarkable was the tone that accompanied them it was wholly new my brothers voice and pleyels were musical and energetic i had fondly imagined that in this respect they were surpassed by none now my mistake was detected i cannot pretend to communicate the impression that was made upon me by these accents or to depict the degree in which force and sweetness were blended in them they were articulated with a distinctness that was unexampled in my experience but this was not all the voice was not only mellifluent and clear but the emphasis was so just and the modulation so impassioned that it seemed as if an heart of stone could not fail of being moved by it it imparted to me an emotion altogether involuntary and incontroulable when he uttered the words for charitys sweet sake i dropped the cloth that i held in my hand my heart overflowed with sympathy and my eyes with unbidden tears  this description will appear to you trifling or incredible the importance of these circumstances will be manifested in the sequel the manner in which i was affected on this occasion was to my own apprehension a subject of astonishment the tones were indeed such as i never heard before but that they should in an instant as it were dissolve me in tears will not easily be believed by others and can scarcely be comprehended by myself  it will be readily supposed that i was somewhat inquisitive as to the person and demeanor of our visitant after a moments pause i stepped to the door and looked after him judge my surprise when i beheld the selfsame figure that had appeared an half hour before upon the bank my fancy had conjured up a very different image a form and attitude and garb were instantly created worthy to accompany such elocution but this person was in all visible respects the reverse of this phantom strange as it may seem i could not speedily reconcile myself to this disappointment instead of returning to my employment i threw myself in a chair that was placed opposite the door and sunk into a fit of musing  my attention was in a few minutes recalled by the stranger who returned with the empty cup in his hand i had not thought of the circumstance or should certainly have chosen a different seat he no sooner showed himself than a confused sense of impropriety added to the suddenness of the interview for which not having foreseen it i had made no preparation threw me into a state of the most painful embarrassment he brought with him a placid brow but no sooner had he cast his eyes upon me than his face was as glowingly suffused as my own he placed the cup upon the bench stammered out thanks and retired  it was some time before i could recover my wonted composure i had snatched a view of the strangers countenance the impression that it made was vivid and indelible his cheeks were pallid and lank his eyes sunken his forehead overshadowed by coarse straggling hairs his teeth large and irregular though sound and brilliantly white and his chin discolored by a tetter his skin was of coarse grain and sallow hue every feature was wide of beauty and the outline of his face reminded you of an inverted cone  and yet his forehead so far as shaggy locks would allow it to be seen his eyes lustrously black and possessing in the midst of haggardness a radiance inexpressibly serene and potent and something in the rest of his features which it would be in vain to describe but which served to betoken a mind of the highest order were essential ingredients in the portrait this in the effects which immediately flowed from it i count among the most extraordinary incidents of my life this face seen for a moment continued for hours to occupy my fancy to the exclusion of almost every other image i had purposed to spend the evening with my brother but i could not resist the inclination of forming a sketch upon paper of this memorable visage whether my hand was aided by any peculiar inspiration or i was deceived by my own fond conceptions this portrait though hastily executed appeared unexceptionable to my own taste  i placed it at all distances and in all lights my eyes were rivetted upon it half the night passed away in wakefulness and in contemplation of this picture so flexible and yet so stubborn is the human mind so obedient to impulses the most transient and brief and yet so unalterably observant of the direction which is given to it how little did i then foresee the termination of that chain of which this may be regarded as the first link  next day arose in darkness and storm torrents of rain fell during the whole day attended with incessant thunder which reverberated in stunning echoes from the opposite declivity the inclemency of the air would not allow me to walk out i had indeed no inclination to leave my apartment i betook myself to the contemplation of this portrait whose attractions time had rather enhanced than diminished i laid aside my usual occupations and seating myself at a window consumed the day in alternately looking out upon the storm and gazing at the picture which lay upon a table before me you will perhaps deem this conduct somewhat singular and ascribe it to certain peculiarities of temper i am not aware of any such peculiarities i can account for my devotion to this image no otherwise than by supposing that its properties were rare and prodigious perhaps you will suspect that such were the first inroads of a passion incident to every female heart and which frequently gains a footing by means even more slight and more improbable than these i shall not controvert the reasonableness of the suspicion but leave you at liberty to draw from my narrative what conclusions you please  night at length returned and the storm ceased the air was once more clear and calm and bore an affecting contrast to that uproar of the elements by which it had been preceded i spent the darksome hours as i spent the day contemplative and seated at the window why was my mind absorbed in thoughts ominous and dreary why did my bosom heave with sighs and my eyes overflow with tears was the tempest that had just past a signal of the ruin which impended over me my soul fondly dwelt upon the images of my brother and his children yet they only increased the mournfulness of my contemplations the smiles of the charming babes were as bland as formerly the same dignity sat on the brow of their father and yet i thought of them with anguish something whispered that the happiness we at present enjoyed was set on mutable foundations death must happen to all whether our felicity was to be subverted by it tomorrow or whether it was ordained that we should lay down our heads full of years and of honor was a question that no human being could solve at other times these ideas seldom intruded i either forbore to reflect upon the destiny that is reserved for all men or the reflection was mixed up with images that disrobed it of terror but now the uncertainty of life occurred to me without any of its usual and alleviating accompaniments i said to myself we must die sooner or later we must disappear for ever from the face of the earth whatever be the links that hold us to life they must be broken this scene of existence is in all its parts calamitous the greater number is oppressed with immediate evils and those the tide of whose fortunes is full how small is their portion of enjoyment since they know that it will terminate  for some time i indulged myself without reluctance in these gloomy thoughts but at length the dejection which they produced became insupportably painful i endeavored to dissipate it with music i had all my grandfathers melody as well as poetry by rote i now lighted by chance on a ballad which commemorated the fate of a german cavalier who fell at the siege of nice under godfrey of bouillon my choice was unfortunate for the scenes of violence and carnage which were here wildly but forcibly pourtrayed only suggested to my thoughts a new topic in the horrors of war  i sought refuge but ineffectually in sleep my mind was thronged by vivid but confused images and no effort that i made was sufficient to drive them away in this situation i heard the clock which hung in the room give the signal for twelve it was the same instrument which formerly hung in my fathers chamber and which on account of its being his workmanship was regarded by every one of our family with veneration it had fallen to me in the division of his property and was placed in this asylum the sound awakened a series of reflections respecting his death i was not allowed to pursue them for scarcely had the vibrations ceased when my attention was attracted by a whisper which at first appeared to proceed from lips that were laid close to my ear  no wonder that a circumstance like this startled me in the first impulse of my terror i uttered a slight scream and shrunk to the opposite side of the bed in a moment however i recovered from my trepidation i was habitually indifferent to all the  of fear by which the majority are afflicted i entertained no apprehension of either ghosts or robbers our security had never been molested by either and i made use of no means to prevent or counterwork their machinations my tranquillity on this occasion was quickly retrieved the whisper evidently proceeded from one who was posted at my bedside the first idea that suggested itself was that it was uttered by the girl who lived with me as a servant perhaps somewhat had alarmed her or she was sick and had come to request my assistance by whispering in my ear she intended to rouse without alarming me  full of this persuasion i called judith said i is it you what do you want is there any thing the matter with you no answer was returned i repeated my inquiry but equally in vain cloudy as was the atmosphere and curtained as my bed was nothing was visible i withdrew the curtain and leaning my head on my elbow i listened with the deepest attention to catch some new sound meanwhile i ran over in my thoughts every circumstance that could assist my conjectures  my habitation was a wooden edifice consisting of two stories in each story were two rooms separated by an entry or middle passage with which they communicated by opposite doors the passage on the lower story had doors at the two ends and a staircase windows answered to the doors on the upper story annexed to this on the eastern side were wings divided in like manner into an upper and lower room one of them comprised a kitchen and chamber above it for the servant and communicated on both stories with the parlour adjoining it below and the chamber adjoining it above the opposite wing is of smaller dimensions the rooms not being above eight feet square the lower of these was used as a depository of household implements the upper was a closet in which i deposited my books and papers they had but one inlet which was from the room adjoining there was no window in the lower one and in the upper a small aperture which communicated light and air but would scarcely admit the body the door which led into this was close to my bedhead and was always locked but when i myself was within the avenues below were accustomed to be closed and bolted at nights  the maid was my only companion and she could not reach my chamber without previously passing through the opposite chamber and the middle passage of which however the doors were usually unfastened if she had occasioned this noise she would have answered my repeated calls no other conclusion therefore was left me but that i had mistaken the sounds and that my imagination had transformed some casual noise into the voice of a human creature satisfied with this solution i was preparing to relinquish my listening attitude when my ear was again saluted with a new and yet louder whispering it appeared as before to issue from lips that touched my pillow a second effort of attention however clearly showed me that the sounds issued from within the closet the door of which was not more than eight inches from my pillow  this second interruption occasioned a shock less vehement than the former i started but gave no audible token of alarm i was so much mistress of my feelings as to continue listening to what should be said the whisper was distinct hoarse and uttered so as to show that the speaker was desirous of being heard by some one near but at the same time studious to avoid being overheard by any other  stop stop i say madman as you are there are better means than that curse upon your rashness there is no need to shoot  such were the words uttered in a tone of eagerness and anger within so small a distance of my pillow what construction could i put upon them my heart began to palpitate with dread of some unknown danger presently another voice but equally near me was heard whispering in answer why not i will draw a trigger in this business but perdition be my lot if i do more to this the first voice returned in a tone which rage had heightened in a small degree above a whisper coward stand aside and see me do it i will grasp her throat i will do her business in an instant she shall not have time so much as to groan what wonder that i was petrified by sounds so dreadful murderers lurked in my closet they were planning the means of my destruction one resolved to shoot and the other menaced suffocation their means being chosen they would forthwith break the door flight instantly suggested itself as most eligible in circumstances so perilous i deliberated not a moment but fear adding wings to my speed i leaped out of bed and scantily robed as i was rushed out of the chamber down stairs and into the open air i can hardly recollect the process of turning keys and withdrawing bolts my terrors urged me forward with almost a mechanical impulse i stopped not till i reached my brothers door i had not gained the threshold when exhausted by the violence of my emotions and by my speed i sunk down in a fit  how long i remained in this situation i know not when i recovered i found myself stretched on a bed surrounded by my sister and her female servants i was astonished at the scene before me but gradually recovered the recollection of what had happened i answered their importunate inquiries as well as i was able my brother and pleyel whom the storm of the preceding day chanced to detain here informing themselves of every particular proceeded with lights and weapons to my deserted habitation they entered my chamber and my closet and found every thing in its proper place and customary order the door of the closet was locked and appeared not to have been opened in my absence they went to judiths apartment they found her asleep and in safety pleyels caution induced him to forbear alarming the girl and finding her wholly ignorant of what had passed they directed her to return to her chamber they then fastened the doors and returned  my friends were disposed to regard this transaction as a dream that persons should be actually immured in this closet to which in the circumstances of the time access from without or within was apparently impossible they could not seriously believe that any human beings had intended murder unless it were to cover a scheme of pillage was incredible but that no such design had been formed was evident from the security in which the furniture of the house and the closet remained  i revolved every incident and expression that had occurred my senses assured me of the truth of them and yet their abruptness and improbability made me in my turn somewhat incredulous the adventure had made a deep impression on my fancy and it was not till after a weeks abode at my brothers that i resolved to resume the possession of my own dwelling  there was another circumstance that enhanced the mysteriousness of this event after my recovery it was obvious to inquire by what means the attention of the family had been drawn to my situation i had fallen before i had reached the threshold or was able to give any signal my brother related that while this was transacting in my chamber he himself was awake in consequence of some slight indisposition and lay according to his custom musing on some favorite topic suddenly the silence which was remarkably profound was broken by a voice of most piercing shrillness that seemed to be uttered by one in the hall below his chamber awake arise it exclaimed hasten to succor one that is dying at your door  this summons was effectual there was no one in the house who was not roused by it pleyel was the first to obey and my brother overtook him before he reached the hall what was the general astonishment when your friend was discovered stretched upon the grass before the door pale ghastly and with every mark of death  this was the third instance of a voice exerted for the benefit of this little community the agent was no less inscrutable in this than in the former case when i ruminated upon these events my soul was suspended in wonder and awe was i really deceived in imagining that i heard the closet conversation i was no longer at liberty to question the reality of those accents which had formerly recalled my brother from the hill which had imparted tidings of the death of the german lady to pleyel and which had lately summoned them to my assistance  but how was i to regard this midnight conversation hoarse and manlike voices conferring on the means of death so near my bed and at such an hour how had my ancient security vanished that dwelling which had hitherto been an inviolate asylum was now beset with danger to my life that solitude formerly so dear to me could no longer be endured pleyel who had consented to reside with us during the months of spring lodged in the vacant chamber in order to quiet my alarms he treated my fears with ridicule and in a short time very slight traces of them remained but as it was wholly indifferent to him whether his nights were passed at my house or at my brothers this arrangement gave general satisfaction  chapter vii i will not enumerate the various inquiries and conjectures which these incidents occasioned after all our efforts we came no nearer to dispelling the mist in which they were involved and time instead of facilitating a solution only accumulated our doubts  in the midst of thoughts excited by these events i was not unmindful of my interview with the stranger i related the particulars and showed the portrait to my friends pleyel recollected to have met with a figure resembling my description in the city but neither his face or garb made the same impression upon him that it made upon me it was a hint to rally me upon my prepossessions and to amuse us with a thousand ludicrous anecdotes which he had collected in his travels he made no scruple to charge me with being in love and threatened to inform the swain when he met him of his good fortune  pleyels temper made him susceptible of no durable impressions his conversation was occasionally visited by gleams of his ancient vivacity but though his impetuosity was sometimes inconvenient there was nothing to dread from his malice i had no fear that my character or dignity would suffer in his hands and was not heartily displeased when he declared his intention of profiting by his first meeting with the stranger to introduce him to our acquaintance  some weeks after this i had spent a toilsome day and as the sun declined found myself disposed to seek relief in a walk the river bank is at this part of it and for some considerable space upward so rugged and steep as not to be easily descended in a recess of this declivity near the southern verge of my little demesne was placed a slight building with seats and lattices from a crevice of the rock to which this edifice was attached there burst sorth a stream of the purest water which leaping from ledge to ledge for the space of sixty feet produced a freshness in the air and a murmur the most delicious and soothing imaginable these added to the odours of the cedars which embowered it and of the honeysuckle which clustered among the lattices rendered this my favorite retreat in summer  on this occasion i repaired hither my spirits drooped through the fatigue of long attention and i threw myself upon a bench in a state both mentally and personally of the utmost supineness the lulling sounds of the waterfall the fragrance and the dusk combined to becalm my spirits and in a short time to sink me into sleep either the uneasiness of my posture or some slight indisposition molested my repose with dreams of no cheerful hue after various incoherences had taken their turn to occupy my fancy i at length imagined myself walking in the evening twilight to my brothers habitation a pit methought had been dug in the path i had taken of which i was not aware as i carelessly pursued my walk i thought i saw my brother standing at some distance before me beckoning and calling me to make haste he stood on the opposite edge of the gulf i mended my pace and one step more would have plunged me into this abyss had not some one from behind caught suddenly my arm and exclaimed in a voice of eagerness and terror hold hold  the sound broke my sleep and i found myself at the next moment standing on my feet and surrounded by the deepest darkness images so terrific and forcible disabled me for a time from distinguishing between sleep and wakefulness and withheld from me the knowledge of my actual condition my first panics were succeeded by the perturbations of surprise to find myself alone in the open air and immersed in so deep a gloom i slowly recollected the incidents of the afternoon and how i came hither i could not estimate the time but saw the propriety of returning with speed to the house my faculties were still too confused and the darkness too intense to allow me immediately to find my way up the steep i sat down therefore to recover myself and to reflect upon my situation  this was no sooner done than a low voice was heard from behind the lattice on the side where i sat between the rock and the lattice was a chasm not wide enough to admit a human body yet in this chasm he that spoke appeared to be stationed attend attend but be not terrified  i started and exclaimed good heavens what is that who are you  a friend one come not to injure but to save you fear nothing  this voice was immediately recognized to be the same with one of those which i had heard in the closet it was the voice of him who had proposed to shoot rather than to strangle his victim my terror made me at once mute and motionless he continued i leagued to murder you i repent mark my bidding and be safe avoid this spot the snares of death encompass it elsewhere danger will be distant but this spot shun it as you value your life mark me further profit by this warning but divulge it not if a syllable of what has passed escape you your doom is sealed remember your father and be faithful  here the accents ceased and left me overwhelmed with dismay i was fraught with the persuasion that during every moment i remained here my life was endangered but i could not take a step without hazard of falling to the bottom of the precipice the path leading to the summit was short but rugged and intricate even starlight was excluded by the umbrage and not the faintest gleam was afforded to guide my steps what should i do to depart or remain was equally and eminently perilous  in this state of uncertainty i perceived a ray flit across the gloom and disappear another succeeded which was stronger and remained for a passing moment it glittered on the shrubs that were scattered at the entrance and gleam continued to succeed gleam for a few seconds till they finally gave place to unintermitted darkness  the first visitings of this light called up a train of horrors in my mind destruction impended over this spot the voice which i had lately heard had warned me to retire and had menaced me with the fate of my father if i refused i was desirous but unable to obey these gleams were such as preluded the stroke by which he fell the hour perhaps was the same  i shuddered as if i had beheld suspended over me the exterminating sword  presently a new and stronger illumination burst through the lattice on the right hand and a voice from the edge of the precipice above called out my name it was pleyel joyfully did i recognize his accents but such was the tumult of my thoughts that i had not power to answer him till he had frequently repeated his summons i hurried at length from the fatal spot and directed by the lanthorn which he bore ascended the hill  pale and breathless it was with difficulty i could support myself he anxiously inquired into the cause of my affright and the motive of my unusual absence he had returned from my brothers at a late hour and was informed by judith that i had walked out before sunset and had not yet returned this intelligence was somewhat alarming he waited some time but my absence continuing he had set out in search of me he had explored the neighborhood with the utmost care but receiving no tidings of me he was preparing to acquaint my brother with this circumstance when he recollected the summer house on the bank and conceived it possible that some accident had detained me there he again inquired into the cause of this detention and of that confusion and dismay which my looks testified  i told him that i had strolled hither in the afternoon that sleep had overtaken me as i sat and that i had awakened a few minutes before his arrival i could tell him no more in the present impetuosity of my thoughts i was almost dubious whether the pit into which my brother had endeavored to entice me and the voice that talked through the lattice were not parts of the same dream i remembered likewise the charge of secrecy and the penalty denounced if i should rashly divulge what i had heard for these reasons i was silent on that subject and shutting myself in my chamber delivered myself up to contemplation  what i have related will no doubt appear to you a fable you will believe that calamity has subverted my reason and that i am amusing you with the chimeras of my brain instead of facts that have really happened i shall not be surprised or offended if these be your suspicions i know not indeed how you can deny them admission for if to me the immediate witness they were fertile of perplexity and doubt how must they affect another to whom they are recommended only by my testimony it was only by subsequent events that i was fully and incontestibly assured of the veracity of my senses  meanwhile what was i to think i had been assured that a design had been formed against my life the ruffians had leagued to murder me whom had i offended who was there with whom i had ever maintained intercourse who was capable of harboring such atrocious purposes  my temper was the reverse of cruel and imperious my heart was touched with sympathy for the children of misfortune but this sympathy was not a barren sentiment my purse scanty as it was was ever open and my hands ever active to relieve distress many were the wretches whom my personal exertions had extricated from want and disease and who rewarded me with their gratitude there was no face which lowered at my approach and no lips which uttered imprecations in my hearing on the contrary there was none over whose fate i had exerted any influence or to whom i was known by reputation who did not greet me with smiles and dismiss me with proofs of veneration yet did not my senses assure me that a plot was laid against my life  i am not destitute of courage i have shown myself deliberative and calm in the midst of peril i have hazarded my own life for the preservation of another but now was i confused and panic struck i have not lived so as to fear death yet to perish by an unseen and secret stroke to be mangled by the knife of an assassin was a thought at which i shuddered what had i done to deserve to be made the victim of malignant passions  but soft was i not assured that my life was safe in all places but one and why was the treason limited to take effect in this spot i was every where equally defenseless my house and chamber were at all times accessible danger still impended over me the bloody purpose was still entertained but the hand that was to execute it was powerless in all places but one  here i had remained for the last four or five hours without the means of resistance or defense yet i had not been attacked a human being was at hand who was conscious of my presence and warned me hereafter to avoid this retreat his voice was not absolutely new but had i never heard it but once before but why did he prohibit me from relating this incident to others and what species of death will be awarded if i disobey  he talked of my father he intimated that disclosure would pull upon my head the same destruction was then the death of my father portentous and inexplicable as it was the consequence of human machinations it should seem that this being is apprised of the true nature of this event and is conscious of the means that led to it whether it shall likewise fall upon me depends upon the observance of silence was it the infraction of a similar command that brought so horrible a penalty upon my father  such were the reflections that haunted me during the night and which effectually deprived me of sleep next morning at breakfast pleyel related an event which my disappearance had hindered him from mentioning the night before early the preceding morning his occasions called him to the city he had stepped into a coffeehouse to while away an hour here he had met a person whose appearance instantly bespoke him to be the same whose hasty visit i have mentioned and whose extraordinary visage and tones had so powerfully affected me on an attentive survey however he proved likewise to be one with whom my friend had had some intercourse in europe this authorized the liberty of accosting him and after some conversation mindful as pleyel said of the footing which this stranger had gained in my heart he had ventured to invite him to mettingen the invitation had been cheerfully accepted and a visit promised on the afternoon of the next day  this information excited no sober emotions in my breast i was of course eager to be informed as to the circumstances of their ancient intercourse when and where had they met what knew he of the life and character of this man  in answer to my inquiries he informed me that three years before he was a traveller in spain he had made an excursion from valencia to murviedro with a view to inspect the remains of roman magnificence scattered in the environs of that town while traversing the site of the theater of old saguntum he lighted upon this man seated on a stone and deeply engaged in perusing the work of the deacon marti a short conversation ensued which proved the stranger to be english they returned to valencia together  his garb aspect and deportment were wholly spanish a residence of three years in the country indefatigable attention to the language and a studious conformity with the customs of the people had made him indistinguishable from a native when he chose to assume that character pleyel found him to he connected on the footing of friendship and respect with many eminent merchants in that city he had embraced the catholic religion and adopted a spanish name instead of his own which was carwin and devoted himself to the literature and religion of his new country he pursued no profession but subsisted on remittances from england  while pleyel remained in valencia carwin betrayed no aversion to intercourse and the former found no small attractions in the society of this new acquaintance on general topics he was highly intelligent and communicative he had visited every corner of spain and could furnish the most accurate details respecting its ancient and present state on topics of religion and of his own history previous to his transformation into a spaniard he was invariably silent you could merely gather from his discourse that he was english and that he was well acquainted with the neighboring countries  his character excited considerable curiosity in this observer it was not easy to reconcile his conversion to the romish faith with those proofs of knowledge and capacity that were exhibited by him on different occasions a suspicion was sometimes admitted that his belief was counterfeited for some political purpose the most careful observation however produced no discovery his manners were at all times harmless and inartificial and his habits those of a lover of contemplation and seclusion he appeared to have contracted an affection for pleyel who was not slow to return it  my friend after a months residence in this city returned into france and since that period had heard nothing concerning carwin till his appearance at mettingen  on this occasion carwin had received pleyels greeting with a certain distance and solemnity to which the latter had not been accustomed he had waved noticing the inquiries of pleyel respecting his desertion of spain in which he had formerly declared that it was his purpose to spend his life he had assiduously diverted the attention of the latter to indifferent topics but was still on every theme as eloquent and judicious as formerly why he had assumed the garb of a rustic pleyel was unable to conjecture perhaps it might be poverty perhaps he was swayed by motives which it was his interest to conceal but which were connected with consequences of the utmost moment  such was the sum of my friends information i was not sorry to be left alone during the greater part of this day every employment was irksome which did not leave me at liberty to meditate i had now a new subject on which to exercise my thoughts before evening i should be ushered into his presence and listen to those tones whose magical and thrilling power i had already experienced but with what new images would he then be accompanied  carwin was an adherent to the romish faith yet was an englishman by birth and perhaps a protestant by education he had adopted spain  his country and had intimated a design to spend his days there yet now was an inhabitant of this district and disguised by the habiliments of a own what could have obliterated the impressions of his youth and made him abjure his religion and his country what subsequent events had introduced so total a change in his plans in withdrawing from spain had he reverted to the religion of his ancestors or was it true that his former conversion was deceitful and that his conduct had been swayed by motives which it was prudent to conceal  hours were consumed in revolving these ideas my meditations were intense and when the series was broken i began to reflect with astonishment on my situation from the death of my parents till the commencement of this year my life had been serene and blissful beyond the ordinary portion of humanity but now my bosom was corroded by anxiety i was visited by dread of unknown dangers and the future was a scene over which clouds rolled and thunders muttered i compared the cause with the effect and they seemed disproportioned to each other all unaware and in a manner which i had no power to explain i was pushed from my immovable and lofty station and cast upon a sea of troubles  i determined to be my brothers visitant on this evening yet my resolves were not unattended with wavering and reluctance pleyels insinuations that i was in love affected in no degree my belief yet the consciousness that this was the opinion of one who would probably be present at our introduction to each other would excite all that confusion which the passion itself is apt to produce this would confirm him in his error and call forth new railleries his mirth when exerted upon this topic was the source of the bitterest vexation had he been aware of its influence upon my happiness his temper would not have allowed him to persist but this influence it was my chief endeavor to conceal that the belief of my having bestowed my heart upon another produced in my friend none but ludicrous sensations was the true cause of my distress but if this had been discovered by him my distress would have been unspeakably aggravated  chapter viii as soon as evening arrived i performed my visit carwin made one of the company into which i was ushered appearances were the fame as when i before beheld him his garb was equally negligent and rustic i gazed upon his countenance with new curiosity my situation was such as to enable me to bestow upon it a deliberate examination viewed at more leisure it lost none of its wonderful properties i could not deny my homage to the intelligence expressed in it but was wholly uncertain whether he were an object to be dreaded or adored and whether his powers had been exerted to evil or to good  he was sparing in discourse but whatever he said was pregnant with meaning and uttered with rectitude of articulation and force of emphasis of which i had entertained no conception previously to my knowledge of him notwithstanding the uncouthness of his garb his manners were not unpolished all topics were handled by him with skill and without pedantry or affectation he uttered no sentiment calculated to produce a disadvantageous impression on the contrary his observations denoted a mind alive to every generous and heroic feeling they were introduced without parade and accompanied with that degree of earnestness which indicates sincerity  he parted from us not till late refusing an invitation to spend the night here but readily consented to repeat his visit his visits were frequently repeated each day introduced us to a more intimate acquaintance with his sentiments but left us wholly in the dark concerning that about which we were most inquisitive he studiously avoided all mention of his past or present situation even the place of his abode in the city he concealed from us  our sphere in this respect being somewhat limited and the intellectual endowments of this man being indisputably great his deportment was more diligently marked and copiously commented on by us than you perhaps will think the circumstances warranted not a gesture or glance or accent that was not in our private assemblies discussed and inferences deduced from it it may well be thought that he modelled his behavior by an uncommon standard when with all our opportunities and accuracy of observation we were able for a long time to gather no satisfactory information he afforded us no ground on which to build even a plausible conjecture  there is a degree of familiarity which takes place between constant associates that justifies the negligence of many rules of which in an earlier period of their intercourse politeness requires the exact observance inquiries into our condition are allowable when they are prompted by a disinterested concern for our welfare and this solicitude is not only pardonable but may justly be demanded from those who choose us for their companions this state of things was more slow to arrive on this occasion than on most others on account of the gravity and loftiness of this mans behavior  pleyel however began at length to employ regular means for this end he occasionally alluded to the circumstances in which they had formerly met and remarked the incongruousness between the religion and habits of a spaniard with those of a native of britain he expressed his astonishment at meeting our guest in this corner of the globe especially as when they parted in spain he was taught to believe that carwin should never leave that country he insinuated that a change so great must have been prompted by motives of a singular and momentous kind  no answer or an answer wide of the purpose was generally made to these insinuations britons and spaniards he said are votaries of the same deity and square their faith by the same precepts their ideas are drawn from the same fountains of literature and they speak dialects of the same tongue their government and laws have more resemblances than differences they were formerly provinces of the same civil and till lately of the same religious empire  as to the motives which induce men to change the place of their abode these must unavoidably be fleeting and mutable if not bound to one spot by conjugal or parental ties or by the nature of that employment to which we are indebted for subsistence the inducements to change are far more numerous and powerful than opposite inducements  he spoke as if desirous of showing that he was not aware of the tendency of pleyels remarks yet certain tokens were apparent that proved him by no means wanting in penetration these tokens were to be read in his countenance and not in his words when any thing was said indicating curiosity in us the gloom of his countenance was deepened his eyes sunk to the ground and his wonted air was not resumed without visible struggle hence it was obvious to infer that some incidents of his life were reflected on by him with regret and that since these incidents were carefully concealed and even that regret which flowed from them laboriously stifled they had not been merely disastrous the secrecy that was observed appeared not designed to provoke or baffle the inquisitive but was prompted by the shame or by the prudence of guilt  these ideas which were adopted by pleyel and my brother as well as myself hindered us from employing more direct means for accomplishing our wishes questions might have been put in such terms that no room should be left for the pretense of misapprehension and if modesty merely had been the obstacle such questions would not have been wanting but we considered that if the disclosure were productive of pain or disgrace it was inhuman to extort it  amidst the various topics that were discussed in his presence allusions were of course made to the inexplicable events that had lately happened at those times the words and looks of this man were objects of my particular attention the subject was extraordinary and any one whose experience or reflections could throw any light upon it was entitled to my gratitude as this man was enlightened by reading and travel i listened with eagerness to the remarks which he should make  at first i entertained a kind of apprehension that the tale would be heard by him with incredulity and secret ridicule i had formerly heard stories that resembled this in some of their mysterious circumstances but they were commonly heard by me with contempt i was doubtful whether the same impression would not now be made on the mind of our guest but i was mistaken in my fears  he heard them with seriousness and without any marks either of surprise or incredulity he pursued with visible pleasure that kind of disquisition which was naturally suggested by them his fancy was eminently vigorous and prolific and if he did not persuade us that human beings are sometimes admitted to a sensible intercourse with the author of nature he at least won over our inclination to the cause he merely deduced from his own reasonings that such intercourse was probable but confessed that though he was acquainted with many instances somewhat similar to those which had been related by us none of them were perfectly exempted from the suspicion of human agency  on being requested to relate these instances he amused us with many curious details his narratives were constructed with so much skill and rehearsed with so much energy that all the effects of a dramatic exhibition were frequently produced by them those that were most coherent and most minute and of consequence least entitled to credit were yet rendered probable by the exquisite art of this rhetorician for every difficulty that was suggested a ready and plausible solution was furnished mysterious voices had always a share in producing the catastrophe but they were always to be explained on some known principles either as reflected into a focus or communicated through a tube i could not but remark that his narratives however complex or mavelous contained no instance sufficiently parallel to those that had befallen ourselves and in which the solution was applicable to our own case  my brother was a much more sanguine reasoner than our guest even in some of the facts which were related by carwin he maintained the probability of celestial interference when the latter was disposed to deny it and had found as he imagined footsteps of an human agent pleyel was by no means equally credulous he scrupled not to deny faith to any testimony but that of his senses and allowed the facts which had lately been supported by this testimony not to mould his belief but merely to give birth to doubts  it was soon observed that carwin adopted in some degree a similar distinction a tale of this kind related by others he would believe provided it was explicable upon known principles but that such notices were actually communicated by beings of an higher order he would believe only when his own ears were assailed in a manner which could not be otherwise accounted for civility forbad him to contradict my brother or myself but his understanding refused to acquiesce in our testimony besides he was disposed to question whether the voices heard in the temple at the foot of the hill and in my closet were not really uttered by human organs on this supposition he was desired to explain how the effect was produced  he answered that the power of mimickry was very common catharines voice might easily be imitated by one at the foot of the hill who would find no difficulty in eluding by flight the search of wieland the tidings of the death of the saxon lady were uttered by one near at hand who overheard the conversation who conjectured her death and whose conjecture happened to accord with the truth that the voice appeared to come from the ceiling was to be considered as an illusion of the fancy the cry for help heard in the hall on the night of my adventure was to be ascribed to an human creature who actually stood in the hall when he uttered it it was of no moment he said that we could not explain by what motives he that made the signal was led hither how imperfectly acquainted were we with the condition and designs of the beings that surrounded us the city was near at hand and thousands might there exist whose powers and purposes might easily explain whatever was mysterious in this transaction as to the closet dialogue he was obliged to adopt one of two suppositions and affirm either that it was fashioned in my own fancy or that it actually took place between two persons in the closet  such was carwins mode of explaining these appearances it is such perhaps as would commend itself as most plausible to the most sagacious minds but it was insufficient to impart conviction to us as to the treason that was meditated against me it was doubtless just to conclude that it was either real or imaginary but that it was real was attested by the mysterious warning in the summer house the secret of which i had hitherto locked up in my own breast  a month passed away in this kind of intercourse as to carwin our ignorance was in no degree enlightened respecting his genuine character and views appearances were uniform no man possessed a larger store of knowledge or a greater degree of skill in the communication of it to others hence he was regarded as an inestimable addition to our society considering the distance of my brothers house from the city he was frequently prevailed upon to pass the night where he spent the evening two days seldom elapsed without a visit from him hence he was regarded as a kind of inmate of the house he entered and departed without ceremony when he arrived he received an unaffected welcome and when he chose to retire no importunities were used to induce him to remain  the temple was the principal scene of our social enjoyments yet the felicity that we tasted when assembled in this asylum was but the gleam of a former sunshine carwin never parted with his gravity the inscrutableness of his character and the uncertainty whether his fellowship tended to good or to evil were seldom absent from our minds this circumstance powerfully contributed in sadden us  my heart was the seat of growing disquietudes this change in one who had formerly been characterized by all the exuberances of soul could not fail to be remarked by my friends my brother was always a pattern of solemnity my sister was clay molded by the circumstances in which she happened to be placed there was but one whose deportment remains to be described as being of importance to our happiness had pleyel likewise dismissed his vivacity  he was as whimsical and jestful as ever but he was not happy the truth in this respect was of too much importance to me not to make me a vigilant observer his mirth was easily perceived to be the fruit of exertion when his thoughts wandered from the company an air of dissatisfaction and impatience stole across his features even the punctuality and frequency of his visits were somewhat lessened it may be supposed that my own uneasiness was heightened by these tokens but strange as it may seem i found in the present state of my mind no relief but in the persuasion that pleyel was unhappy  that unhappiness indeed depended for its value in my eyes on the cause that produced it it did not arise from the death of the saxon lady it was not a contagious emanation from the countenances of wieland or carwin there was but one other source whence it could flow a nameless ecstacy thrilled through my frame when any new proof occurred that the ambiguousness of my behavior was the cause  chapter ix my brother had received a new book from germany it was a tragedy and the first attempt of a saxon poet of whom my brother had been taught to entertain the highest expectations the exploits of zisca the bohemian hero were woven into a dramatic series and connection according to german custom it was minute and diffuse and dictated by an adventurous and lawless fancy it was a chain of audacious acts and unheard of disasters the moated fortress and the thicket the ambush and the battle and the conflict of headlong passions were pourtrayed in wild numbers and with terrific energy an afternoon was set apart to rehearse this performance the language was familiar to all of us but carwin whose company therefore was tacitly dispensed with  the morning previous to this intended rehearsal i spent at home my mind was occupied with reflections relative to my own situation the sentiment which lived with chief energy in my heart was connected with the image of pleyel in the midst of my anguish i had not been destitute of consolation his late deportment had given spring to my hopes was not the hour at hand which should render me the happiest of human creatures he suspected that i looked with favorable eyes upon carwin hence arose disquietudes which he struggled in vain to conceal he loved me but was hopeless that his love would be compensated is it not time said i to rectify this error but by what means is this to be effected it can only be done by a change of deportment in me but how must i demean myself for this purpose  i must not speak neither eyes nor lips must impart the information he must not be assured that my heart is his previous to the tender of his own but he must be convinced that it has not been given to another he must be supplied with space whereon to build a doubt as to the true state of my affections he must be prompted to avow himself the line of delicate propriety how hard it is not to fall short and not to overleap it  this afternoon we shall meet at the temple we shall not separate till late it will be his province to accompany me home the airy expanse is without a speck this breeze is usually steadfast and its promise of a bland and cloudless evening may be trusted the moon will rise at eleven and at that hour we shall wind along this bank possibly that hour may decide my fate if suitable encouragement be given pleyel will reveal his soul to me and i ere i reach this threshold will be made the happiest of beings and is this good to be mine add wings to thy speed sweet evening and thou moon i charge thee shroud thy beams at the moment when my pleyel whispers love i would not for the world that the burning blushes and the mounting raptures of that moment should be visible  but what encouragement is wanting i must be regardful of insurmountable limits yet when minds are imbued with a genuine sympathy are not words and looks superfluous are not motion and touch sufficient to impart feelings such as mine has he not eyed me at moments when the pressure of his hand has thrown me into tumults and was it possible that he mistook the impetuosities of love for the eloquence of indignation  but the hastening evening will decide would it were come and yet i shudder at its near approach an interview that must thus terminate is surely to be wished for by me and yet it is not without its terrors would to heaven it were come and gone  i feel no reluctance my friends to be thus explicit time was when these emotions would be hidden with immeasurable solicitude from every human eye alas these airy and fleeting impulses of shame are gone my scruples were preposterous and criminal they are bred in all hearts by a perverse and vicious education and they would still have maintained their place in my heart had not my portion been set in misery my errors have taught me thus much wisdom that those sentiments which we ought not to disclose it is criminal to harbor  it was proposed to begin the rehearsal at four oclock i counted the minutes as they passed their flight was at once too rapid and too slow my sensations were of an excruciating kind i could taste no food nor apply to any task nor enjoy a moments repose when the hour arrived i hastened to my brothers  pleyel was not there he had not yet come on ordinary occasions he was eminent for punctuality he had testified great eagerness to share in the pleasures of this rehearsal he was to divide the task with my brother and in tasks like these he always engaged with peculiar zeal his elocution was less sweet than sonorous and therefore better adapted than the mellifluences of his friend to the outrageous vehemence of this drama  what could detain him perhaps he lingered through forgetfulness yet this was incredible never had his memory been known to fail upon even more trivial occasions not less impossible was it that the scheme had lost its attractions and that he staid because his coming would afford him no gratification but why should we expect him to adhere to the minute  an half hour elapsed but pleyel was still at a distance perhaps he had misunderstood the hour which had been proposed perhaps he had conceived that tomorrow and not today had been selected for this purpose but no a review of preceding circumstances demonstrated that such misapprehension was impossible for he had himself proposed this day and this hour this day his attention would not otherwise be occupied but tomorrow an indispensible engagement was foreseen by which all his time would be engrossed his detention therefore must be owing to some unforeseen and extraordinary event our conjectures were vague tumultuous and sometimes fearful his sickness and his death might possibly have detained him  tortured with suspense we sat gazing at each other and at the path which led from the road every horseman that passed was for a moment imagined to be him hour succeeded hour and the sun gradually declining at length disappeared every signal of his coming proved fallacious and our hopes were at length dismissed his absence affected my friends in no insupportable degree they should be obliged they said to defer this undertaking till the morrow and perhaps their impatient curiosity would compel them to dispense entirely with his presence no doubt some harmless occurrence had diverted him from his purpose and they trusted that they should receive a satisfactory account of him in the morning  it may be supposed that this disappointment affected me in a very different manner i turned aside my head to conceal my tears i fled into solitude to give vent to my reproaches without interruption or restraint my heart was ready to burst with indignation and grief pleyel was not the only object of my keen but unjust upbraiding deeply did i execrate my own folly thus fallen into ruins was the gay fabric which i had reared thus had my golden vision melted into air  how fondly did i dream that pleyel was a lover if he were would he have suffered any obstacle to hinder his coming blind and infatuated man i exclaimed thou sportest with happiness the good that is offered thee thou have the insolence and folly to refuse well i will henceforth entrust may felicity to no ones keeping but my own  the first agonies of this disappointment would not allow me to be reasonable or just every ground on which i had built the persuasion that pleyel was not unimpressed in my favor appeared to vanish it seemed as if i had been misled into this opinion by the most palpable illusions  i made some trifling excuse and returned much earlier than i expected to my own house i retired early to my chamber without designing to sleep i placed myself at a window and gave the reins to reflection  the hateful and degrading impulses which had lately controuled me were in some degree removed new dejection succeeded but was now produced by contemplating my late behavior surely that passion is worthy to be abhorred which obscures our understanding and urges us to the commission of injustice what right had i to expect his attendance had i not demeaned myself like one indifferent to his happiness and as having bestowed my regards upon another his absence might be prompted by the love which i considered his absence as a proof that he wanted he came not because the sight of me the spectacle of my coldness or aversion contributed to his despair why should i prolong by hyprocrisy or silence his misery as well as my own why not deal with him explicitly and assure him of the truth  you will hardly believe that in obedience to this suggestion i rose for the purpose of ordering a light that i might instantly make this confession in a letter a second thought showed me the rashness of this scheme and i wondered by what infirmity of mind i could be betrayed into a momentary approbation of it i saw with the utmost clearness that a confession like that would be the most remediless and unpardonable outrage upon the dignity of my sex and utterly unworthy of that passion which controuled me  i resumed my seat and my musing to account for the absence of pleyel became once more the scope of my conjectures how many incidents might occur to raise an insuperable impediment in his way when i was a child a scheme of pleasure in which he and his sister were parties had been in like manner frustrated by his absence but his absence in that instance had been occasioned by his falling from a boat into the river in consequence of which he had run the most imminent hazard of being drowned here was a second disappointment endured by the same persons and produced by his failure might it not originate in the same cause had he not designed to cross the river that morning to make some necessary purchases in jersey he had preconcerted to return to his own house to dinner but perhaps some disaster had befallen him experience had taught me the insecurity of a canoe and that was the only kind of boat which pleyel used i was likewise actuated by an hereditary dread of water these circumstances combined to bestow considerable plausibility on this conjecture but the consternation with which i began to be seized was allayed by reflecting that if this disaster had happened my brother would have received the speediest information of it the consolation which this idea imparted was ravished from me by a new thought this disaster might have happened and his family not be apprized of it the first intelligence of his fate may be communicated by the livid corpse which the tide may cast many days hence upon the shore  thus was i distressed by opposite conjectures thus was i tormented by phantoms of my own creation it was not always thus i can ascertain the date when my mind became the victim of this imbecility perhaps it was coeval with the inroad of a fatal passion a passion that will never rank me in the number of its eulogists it was alone sufficient to the extermination of my peace it was itself a plenteous source of calamity and needed not the concurrence of other evils to take away the attractions of existence and dig for me an untimely grave  the state of my mind naturally introduced a train of reflections upon the dangers and cares which inevitably beset an human being by no violent transition was i led to ponder on the turbulent life and mysterious end of my father i cherished with the utmost veneration the memory of this man and every relic connected with his fate was preserved with the most scrupulous care among these was to be numbered a manuscript containing memoirs of his own life the narrative was by no means recommended by its eloquence but neither did all its value flow from my relationship to the author its style had an unaffected and picturesque simplicity the great variety and circumstantial display of the incidents together with their intrinsic importance as descriptive of human manners and passions made it the most useful book in my collection it was late but being sensible of no inclination to sleep i resolved to betake myself to the perusal of it  to do this it was requisite to procure a light the girl had long since retired to her chamber it was therefore proper to wait upon myself a lamp and the means of lighting it were only to be found in the kitchen thither i resolved forthwith to repair but the light was of use merely to enable me to read the book i knew the shelf and the spot where it stood whether i took down the book or prepared the lamp in the first place appeared to be a matter of no moment the latter was preferred and leaving my seat i approached the closet in which as i mentioned formerly my books and papers were deposited  suddenly the remembrance of what had lately passed in this closet occurred whether midnight was approaching or had passed i knew not i was as then alone and defenseless the wind was in that direction in which aided by the deathlike repose of nature it brought to me the murmur of the waterfall this was mingled with that solemn and enchanting sound which a breeze produces among the leaves of pines the words of that mysterious dialogue then fearful import and the wild excess to which i was transported by my terrors filled my imagination anew my steps faultered and i stood a moment to recover myself  i prevailed on myself at length to move toward the closet i touched the lock but my fingers were powerless i was visited afresh by unconquerable apprehensions a sort of belief darted into my mind that some being was concealed within whose purposes were evil i began to contend with those fears when it occurred to me that i might without impropriety go for a lamp previously to opening the closet i receded a few steps but before i reached my chamber door my thoughts took a new direction motion seemed to produce a mechanical influence upon me i was ashamed of my weakness besides what aid could be afforded me by a lamp  my fears had pictured to themselves no precise object it would be difficult to depict in words the ingredients and hues of that phantom which haunted me an hand invisible and of preternatural strength lifted by human passions and selecting my life for its aim were parts of this terrific image all places were alike accessible to this foe or if his empire were restricted by local bounds those bounds were utterly inscrutable by me but had i not been told by some one in league with this enemy that every place but the recess in the bank was exempt from danger  i returned to the closet and once more put my hand upon the lock o may my ears lose their sensibility ere they be again assailed by a shriek so terrible not merely my understanding was subdued by the sound it acted on my nerves like an edge of steel it appeared to cut asunder the fibers of my brain and rack every joint with agony  the cry loud and piercing as it was was nevertheless human no articulation was ever more distinct the breath which accompanied it did not fan my hair yet did every circumstance combine to persuade me that the lips which uttered it touched my very shoulder  hold hold were the words of this tremendous prohibition in whose tone the whole soul seemed to be rapt up and every energy converted into eagerness and terror  shuddering i dashed myself against the wall and by the same involuntary impulse turned my face backward to examine the mysterious monitor the moonlight streamed into each window and every corner of the room was conspicuous and yet i beheld nothing  the interval was too brief to be artificially measured between the utterance of these words and my scrutiny directed to the quarter whence they came yet if a human being had been there could he fail to have been visible which of my senses was the prey of a fatal illusion the shock which the sound produced was still felt in every part of my frame the sound therefore could not but be a genuine commotion but that i had heard it was not more true than that the being who uttered it was stationed at my right ear yet my attendant was invisible  i cannot describe the state of my thoughts at that moment surprise had mastered my faculties my frame shook and the vital current was congealed i was conscious only to the vehemence of my sensations this condition could not be lasting like a tide which suddenly mounts to an overwhelming height and then gradually subsides my confusion slowly gave place to order and my tumults to a calm i was able to deliberate and move i resumed my feet and advanced into the midst of the room upward and behind and on each side i threw penetrating glances i was not satisfied with one examination he that hitherto refused to be seen might change his purpose and on the next survey be clearly distinguishable  solitude imposes least restraint upon the fancy dark is less fertile of images than the feeble luster of the moon i was alone and the walls were chequered by shadowy forms as the moon passed behind a cloud and emerged these shadows seemed to be endowed with life and to move the apartment was open to the breeze and the curtain was occasionally blown from its ordinary position this motion was not unaccompanied with sound i failed not to snatch a look and to listen when this motion and this sound occurred my belief that my monitor was posted near was strong and instantly converted these appearances to tokens of his presence and yet i could discern nothing  when my thoughts were at length permitted to revert to the past the first idea that occurred was the resemblance between the words of the voice which i had just heard and those which had terminated my dream in the summer house there are means by which we are able to distinguish a substance from a shadow a reality from the phantom of a dream the pit my brother beckoning me forward the seizure of my arm and the voice behind were surely imaginary that these incidents were fashioned in my sleep is supported by the same indubitable evidence that compels me to believe myself awake at present yet the words and the voice were the same then by some inexplicable contrivance i was aware of the danger while my actions and sensations were those of one wholly unacquainted with it now was it not equally true that my actions and persuasions were at war had not the belief that evil lurked in the closet gained admittance and had not my actions betokened an unwarrantable security to obviate the effects of my infatuation the same means had been used  in my dream he that tempted me to my destruction was my brother death was ambushed in my path from what evil was i now rescued what minister or implement of ill was shut up in this recess who was it whose suffocating grasp i was to feel should i dare to enter it what monstrous conception is this my brother  no protection and not injury is his province strange and terrible chimera yet it would not be suddenly dismissed it was surely no vulgar agency that gave this form to my fears he to whom all parts of time are equally present whom no contingency approaches was the author of that spell which now seized upon me life was dear to me no consideration was present that enjoined me to relinquish it sacred duty combined with every spontaneous sentiment to endear to me my being should i not shudder when my being was endangered but what emotion should possess me when the arm lifted against me was wielands  ideas exist in our minds that can be accounted for by no established laws why did i dream that my brother was my foe why but because an omen of my fate was ordained to be communicated yet what salutary end did it serve did it arm me with caution to elude or fortitude to bear the evils to which i was reserved my present thoughts were no doubt indebted for their hue to the similitude existing between these incidents and those of my dream surely it was phrenzy that dictated my deed that a ruffian was hidden in the closet was an idea the genuine tendency of which was to urge me to flight such had been the effect formerly produced had my mind been simply occupied with this thought at present no doubt the same impulse would have been experienced but now it was my brother whom i was irresistably persuaded to regard as the contriver of that ill of which i had been forewarned this persuasion did not extenuate my fears or my danger why then did i again approach the closet and withdraw the bolt my resolution was instantly conceived and executed without faultering  the door was formed of light materials the lock of simple structure easily forewent its hold it opened into the room and commonly moved upon its hinges after being unfastened without any effort of mine this effort however was bestowed upon the present occasion it was my purpose to open it with quickness but the exertion which i made was ineffectual it refused to open  at another time this circumstance would not have looked with a face of mystery i should have supposed some casual obstruction and repeated my efforts to surmount it but now my mind was accessible to no conjecture but one the door was hindered from opening by human force surely here was new cause for affright this was confirmation proper to decide my conduct now was all ground of hesitation taken away what could be supposed but that i deserted the chamber and the house that i at least endeavored no longer to withdraw the door  have i not said that my actions were dictated by phrenzy my reason had forborne for a time to suggest or to sway my resolves i reiterated my endeavors i exerted all my force to overcome the obstacle but in vain the strength that was exerted to keep it shut was superior to mine  a casual observer might perhaps applaud the audaciousness of this conduct whence but from an habitual defiance of danger could my perseverance arise i have already assigned as distinctly as i am able the cause of it the frantic conception that my brother was within that the resistance made to my design was exerted by him had rooted itself in my mind you will comprehend the height of this infatuation when i tell you that finding all my exertions vain i betook myself to exclamations surely i was utterly bereft of understanding  now had i arrived at the crisis of my fate o hinder not the door to open i exclaimed in a tone that had less of fear than of grief in it i know you well come forth but harm me not i beseech you come forth  i had taken my hand from the lock and removed to a small distance from the door i had scarcely uttered these words when the door swung upon its hinges and displayed to my view the interior of the closet whoever was within was shrouded in darkness a few seconds passed without interruption of the silence i knew not what to expect or to fear my eyes would not stray from the recess presently a deep sigh was heard the quarter from which it came heightened the eagerness of my gaze some one approached from the father end i quickly perceived the outlines of a human figure its steps were irresolute and slow i recoiled as it advanced  by coming at length within the verge of the room his form was clearly distinguishable i had prefigured to myself a very different personage the face that presented itself was the last that i should desire to meet at an hour and in a place like this my wonder was stifled by my fears assassins had lurked in this recess some divine voice warned me of danger that at this moment awaited me i had spurned the intimation and challenged my adversary  i recalled the mysterious countenance and dubious character of carwin what motive but atrocious ones could guide his steps hither i was alone my habit suited the hour and the place and the warmth of the season all succor was remote he had placed himself between me and the door my frame shook with the vehemence of my apprehensions  yet i was not wholly lost to myself i vigilantly marked his demeanor his looks were grave but not without perturbation what species of inquietude it betrayed the light was not strong enough to enable me to discover he stood still but his eyes wandered from one object to another when these powerful organs were fixed upon me i shrunk into myself at length he broke silence earnestness and not embarrassment was in his tone he advanced close to me while he spoke  what voice was that which lately addressed you  he paused for an answer but observing my trepidation he resumed with undiminished solemnity be not terrified whoever he was he have done you an important service i need not ask you if it were the voice of a companion that sound was beyond the compass of human organs the knowledge that enabled him to tell you who was in the closet was obtained by incomprehensible means  you knew that carwin was there were you not apprized of his intents the same power could impart the one as well as the other yet knowing these you persisted audacious girl but perhaps you confided in his guardianship your confidence was just with succor like this at hand you may safely defy me  he is my eternal foe the baffler of my best concerted schemes twice have you been saved by his accursed interposition but for him i should long ere now have borne away the spoils of your honor  he looked at me with greater stedfastness than before i became every moment more anxious for my safety it was with difficulty i stammered out an entreaty that he would instantly depart or suffer me to do so he paid no regard to my request but proceeded in a more impassioned manner  what is it you fear have i not told you you are safe has not one in whom you more reasonably place trust assured you of it even if i execute my purpose what injury is done your prejudices will call it by that name but it merits it not  i was impelled by a sentiment that does you honor a sentiment that would sanctify my deed but whatever it be you are safe be this chimera still worshipped i will do nothing to pollute it there he stopped  the accents and gestures of this man left me drained of all courage surely on no other occasion should i have been thus pusillanimous my state i regarded as a hopeless one i was wholly at the mercy of this being whichever way i turned my eyes i saw no avenue by which i might escape the resources of my personal strength my ingenuity and my eloquence i estimated at nothing the dignity of virtue and the force of truth i had been accustomed to celebrate and had frequently vaunted of the conquests which i should make with their assistance  i used to suppose that certain evils could never befall a being in possession of a sound mind that true virtue supplies us with energy whcih vice can never resist that it was always in our power to obstruct by his own death the designs of an enemy who aimed at less than our life how was it that a sentiment like despair had now invaded me and that i trusted to the protection of chance or to the pity of my persecutor  his words imparted some notion of the injury which he had meditated he talked of obstacles that had risen in his way he had relinquished his design these sources supplied me with slender consolation there was no security but in his absence when i looked at myself when i reflected on the hour and the place i was overpowered by horror and dejection  he was silent museful and inattentive to my situation yet made no motion to depart i was silent in my turn what could i say i was confident that reason in this contest would be impotent i must owe my safety to his own suggestions whatever purpose brought him hither he had changed it why then did he remain his resolutions might fluctuate and the pause of a few minutes restore to him his first resolutions  yet was not this the man whom we had treated with unwearied kindness whose society was endeared to us by his intellectual elevation and accomplishments who had a thousand times expatiated on the usefulness and beauty of virtue why should such a one be dreaded if i could have forgotten the circumstances in which our interview had taken place i might have treated his words as jests presently he resumed  fear me not the space that severs us is small and all visible succor is distant you believe yourself completely in my power that you stand upon the brink of ruin such are your groundless fears i cannot lift a finger to hurt you easier it would be to stop the moon in her course than to injure you the power that protects you would crumble my sinews and reduce me to a heap of ashes in a moment if i were to harbor a thought hostile to your safety  thus are appearances at length solved little did i expect that they originated hence what a portion is assigned to you scanned by the eyes of this intelligence your path will be without pits to swallow or snares to entangle you environed by the arms of this protection all artifices will be frustrated and all malice repelled  here succeeded a new pause i was still observant of every gesture and look the tranquil solemnity that had lately possessed his countenance gave way to a new expression all now was trepidation and anxiety  i must be gone said he in a faltering accent why do i linger here i will not ask your forgiveness i see that your terrors are invincible your pardon will be extorted by fear and not dictated by compassion i must fly from you forever he that could plot against your honor must expect from you and your friends persecution and death i must doom myself to endless exile  saying this the hastily left the room i listened while he descended the stairs and unbolting the outer door went forth i did not follow him with my eyes as the moonlight would have enabled me to do relieved by his absence and exhausted by the conflict of my fears i threw myself on a chair and resigned myself to those bewildering ideas which incidents like these could not fail to produce  chapter x order could not readily be introduced into my thoughts the voice still rung in my ears every accent that was uttered by carwin was fresh in my remembrance his unwelcome approach the recognition of his person his hasty departure produced a complex impression on my mind which no words can delineate i strove to give a slower motion to my thoughts and to regulate a confusion which became painful but my efforts were nugatory i covered my eyes with my hand and sat i know not how long without power to arrange or utter my conceptions  i had remained for hours as i believed in absolute solitude no thought of personal danger had molested my tranquillity i had made no preparation for defense what was it that suggested the design of perusing my fathers manuscript if instead of this i had retired to bed and to sleep to what fate might i not have been reserved the ruffian who must almost have suppressed his breathings to screen himself from discovery would have noticed this signal and i should have awakened only to perish with affright and to abhor myself could i have remained unconscious of my danger could i have tranquilly slept in the midst of so deadly a snare  and who was he that threatened to destroy me by what means could he hide himself in this closet surely he is gifted with supernatural power such is the enemy of whose attempts i was forewarned daily i had seen him and conversed with him nothing could be discerned through the impenetrable veil of his duplicity when busied in conjectures as to the author of the evil that was threatened my mind did not light for a moment upon his image yet has he not avowed himself my enemy why should he be here if he had not meditated evil  he confesses that this has been his second attempt what was the scene of his former conspiracy was it not he whose whispers betrayed him am i deceived or was there not a faint resemblance between the voice of this man and that which talked of grasping my throat and extinguishing my life in a moment then he had a colleague in his crime now he is alone then death was the scope of his thoughts now an injury unspeakably more dreadful how thankful should i be to the power that has interposed to save me  that power is invisible it is subject to the cognizance of one of my senses what are the means that will inform me of what nature it is he has set himself to counterwork the machinations of this man who had menaced destruction to all that is dear to me and whose cunning had surmounted every human impediment there was none to rescue me from his grasp my rashness even hastened the completion of his scheme and precluded him from the benefits of deliberation i had robbed him of the power to repent and forbear had i been apprized of the danger i should have regarded my conduct as the means of rendering my escape from it impossible such likewise seem to have been the fears of my invisible protector else why that startling entreaty to refrain from opening the closet by what inexplicable infatuation was i compelled to proceed  yet my conduct was wise carwin unable to comprehend my folly ascribed my behavior to my knowledge he conceived himself previously detected and such detection being possible to flow only from my heavenly friend and his enemy his fears acquired additional strength  he is apprized of the nature and intentions of this being perhaps he is a human agent yet on that supposition his achievements are incredible why should i be selected as the object of his care or it a mere mortal should i not recognize some one whom benefits imparted and received had prompted to love me what were the limits and duration of his guardianship was the genius of my birth entrusted by divine benignity with this province are human faculties adequate to receive stronger proofs of the existence of unfettered and beneficent intelligences than i have received  but who was this mans coadjutor the voice that acknowledged an alliance in treachery with carwin warned me to avoid the summer house he assured me that there only my safety was endangered his assurance as it now appears was fallacious was there not deceit in his admonition was his compact really annulled some purpose was perhaps to be accomplished by preventing my future visits to that spot why was i enjoined silence to others on the subject of this admonition unless it were for some unauthorized and guilty purpose  no one but myself was accustomed to visit it backward it was hidden from distant view by the rock and in front it was screened from all examination by creeping plants and the branches of cedars what recess could be more propitious to secrecy the spirit which haunted it formerly was pure and rapturous it was a fane sacred to the memory of infantile days and to blissful imaginations of the future what a gloomy reverse had succeeded since the ominous arrival of this stranger now perhaps it is the scene of his meditations purposes fraught with horror that shun the light and contemplate the pollution of innocence are here engendered and fostered and reared to maturity  such were the ideas that during the night were tumultuously revolved by me i reviewed every conversation in which carwin had borne a part i studied to discover the true inferences deducible from his deportment and words with regard to his former adventures and actual views i pondered on the comments which he made on the relation which i had given of the closet dialogue no new ideas suggested themselves in the course of this review my expectation had from the first been disappointed on the small degree of surprise which this narrative excited in him he never explicitly declared his opinion as to the nature of those voices o decided whether they were real or visionary he recommended no measures of caution or prevention  but what measures were now to be taken was the danger which threatened me at an end had i nothing more to fear i was lonely and without means of defense i could not calculate the motives and regulate the footsteps of this person what certainty was there that he would not reassume his purposes and swiftly return to the execution of them  this idea covered me once more with dismay how deeply did i regret the solitude in which i was placed and how ardently did i desire the return of day but neither of these inconveniences were susceptible of remedy at first it occurred to me to summon my servant and make her spend the night in my chamber but the inefficacy of this expedient to enhance my safety was easily seen once i resolved to leave the house and retire to my brothers but was deterred by reflecting on the unseasonableness of the hour on the alarm which my arrival and the account which i should be obliged to give might occasion and on the danger to which i might expose myself in the way thither i began likewise to consider carwins return to molest me as exceedingly improbable he had relinquished of his own accord his design and departed without compulsion  surely said i there is omnipotence in the cause that changed the views of a man like carwin the divinity that shielded me from his attempts will take suitable care of my future safety thus to yield to my fears is to deserve that they should be real  scarcely had i uttered these words when my attention was startled by the sound of footsteps they denoted some one stepping into the piazza in front of my house my newborn confidence was extinguished in a moment carwin i thought had repented his departure and was hastily returning the possibility that his return was prompted by intentions consistent with my safety found no place in my mind images of violation and murder assailed me anew and the terrors which succeeded almost incapacitated me from taking any measures for my defense it was an impulse of which i was scarcely conscious that made me fasten the lock and draw the bolts of my chamber door having done this i threw myself on a seat for i trembled to a degree which disabled me from standing and my soul was so perfectly absorbed in the act of listening that almost the vital motions were stopped  the door below creaked on its hinges it was not again thrust to but appeared to remain open footsteps entered traversed the entry and began to mount the stairs how i detested the folly of not pursuing the man when he withdrew and bolting after him the outer door might he not conceive this omission to be a proof that my angel had deserted me and be thereby fortified in guilt  every step on the stairs which brought him nearer to my chamber added vigor to my desperation the evil with which i was menaced was to be at any rate eluded how little did i preconceive the conduct which in an exigence like this i should be prone to adopt you will suppose that deliberation and despair would have suggested the same course of action and that i should have unhesitatingly resorted to the best means of personal defense within my power a penknife lay open upon my table i remembered that it was there and seized it for what purpose you will scarcely inquire it will be immediately supposed that i meant it for my last refuge and that if all other means should fail i should plunge it into the heart of my ravisher  i have lost all faith in the stedfastness of human resolves it was thus that in periods of calm i had determined to act no cowardice had been held by me in greater abhorrence than that which prompted an injured female to destroy not her injurer ere the injury was perpetrated but herself when it was without remedy yet now this penknife appeared to me of no other use than to baffle my assailant and prevent the crime by destroying myself to deliberate at such a time was impossible but among the tumultuous suggestions of the moment i do not recollect that it once occurred to me to use it as an instrument of direct defense  the steps had now reached the second floor every footfall accelerated the completion without augmenting the certainty of evil the consciousness that the door was fast now that nothing but that was interposed between me and danger was a source of some consolation i cast my eye toward the window this likewise was a new suggestion if the door should give way it was my sudden resolution to throw myself from the window its height from the ground which was covered beneath by a brick pavement would insure my destruction but i thought not of that  when opposite to my door the footsteps ceased was he listening whether my fears were allayed and my caution were asleep did he hope to take me by surprise yet if so why did he allow so many noisy signals to betray his approach presently the steps were again heard to approach the door an hand was laid upon the lock and the latch pulled back did he imagine it possible that i should fail to secure the door a slight effort was made to push it open as if all bolts being withdrawn a slight effort only was required  i no sooner perceived this than i moved swiftly toward the window carwins frame might be said to be all muscle his strength and activity had appeared in various instances to be prodigious a slight exertion of his force would demolish the door would not that exertion be made too surely it would but at the same moment that this obstacle should yield and he should enter the apartment my determination was formed to leap from the window my senses were still bound to this object i gazed at the door in momentary expectation that the assault would be made the pause continued the person without was irresolute and motionless  suddenly it occurred to me that carwin might conceive me to have fled that i had not betaken myself to flight was indeed the least probable of all conclusions in this persuasion he must have been confirmed on finding the lower door unfastened and the chamber door locked was it not wise to foster this persuasion should i maintain deep silence this in addition to other circumstances might encourage the belief and he would once more depart every new reflection added plausibility to this reasoning it was presently more strongly enforced when i noticed footsteps withdrawing from the door the blood once more flowed back to my heart and a dawn of exultation began to rise but my joy was short lived instead of descending the stairs he passed to the door of the opposite chamber opened it and having entered shut it after him with a violence that shook the house  how was i to interpret this circumstance for what end could he have entered this chamber did the violence with which he closed the door testify the depth of his vexation this room was usually occupied by pleyel was carwin aware of his absence on this night could he be suspected of a design so sordid as pillage if this were his view there were no means in my power to frustrate it it behoved me to seize the first opportunity to escape but if my escape were supposed by my enemy to have been already effected no asylum was more secure than the present how could my passage from the house be accomplished without noises that might incite him to pursue me  utterly at a loss to account for his going into pleyels chamber i waited in instant expectation of hearing him come forth all however was profoundly still i listened in vain for a considerable period to catch the sound of the door when it should again be opened there was no other avenue by which he could escape but a door which led into the girls chamber would any evil from this quarter befall the girl  hence arose a new train of apprehensions they merely added to the turbulence and agony of my reflections whatever evil impended over her i had no power to avert it seclusion and silence were the only means of saving myself from the perils of this fatal night what solemn vows did i put up that if i should once more behold the light of day i would never trust myself again within the threshold of this dwelling  minute lingered after minute but no token was given that carwin had returned to the passage what i again asked could detain him in this room was it possible that he had returned and glided unperceived away i was speedily aware of the difficulty that attended an enterprise like this and yet as if by that means i were capable of gaining any information on that head i cast anxious looks from the window  the object that first attracted my attention was an human figure standing on the edge of the bank perhaps my penetration was assisted by my hopes be that as it will the figure of carwin was clearly distinguishable from the obscurity of my station it was impossible that i should be discerned by him and yet he scarcely suffered me to catch a glimpse of him he turned and went down the steep which in this part was not difficult to be scaled  my conjecture then had been right carwin was softly opened the door descended the stairs and issued forth that i should not have overheard his steps was only less incredible than that my eyes had deceived me but what was now to be done the house was at length delivered from this detested inmate by one avenue might he again reenter was it not wise to bar the lower door perhaps he had gone out by the kitchen door for this end he must have passed through judiths chamber these entrances being closed and bolted as great security was gained as was compatible with my lonely condition  the propriety of these measures was too manifest not to make me struggle successfully with my fears yet i opened my own door with the utmost caution and descended as if i were afraid that carwin had been still immured in pleyels chamber the outer door was ajar i shut with trembling eagerness and drew every bolt that appended to it i then passed with light and less cautious steps through the parlour but was surprised to discover that the kitchen door was secure i was compelled to acquiesce in the first conjecture that carwin had escaped through the entry  my heart was now somewhat eased of the load of apprehension i returned once more to my chamber the door of which i was careful to lock it was no time to think of repose the moonlight began already to fade before the light of the day the approach of morning was betokened by the usual signals i mused upon the events of this night and determined to take up my abode henceforth at my brothers whether i should inform him of what had happened was a question which seemed to demand some consideration my safety unquestionably required that i should abandon my present habitation  as my thoughts began to flow with fewer impediments the image of pleyel and the dubiousness of his condition again recurred to me i again ran over the possible causes of his absence on the preceding day my mind was attuned to melancholy i dwelt with an obstinacy for which i could not account on the idea of his death i painted to myself his struggles with the billows and his last appearance i imagined myself a midnight wanderer on the shore and to have stumbled on his corpse which the tide had cast up these dreary images affected me even to tears i endeavored not to restrain them they imparted a relief which i had not anticipated the more copiously they flowed the more did my general sensations appear to subside into calm and a certain restlessness give way to repose  perhaps relieved by this effusion the slumber so much wanted might have stolen on my senses had there been no new cause of alarm  chapter xi i was aroused from this stupor by sounds that evidently arose in the next chamber was it possible that i had been mistaken in the figure which i had seen on the bank or had carwin by some inscrutable means penetrated once more into this chamber the opposite door opened footsteps came forth and the person advancing to mine knocked  so unexpected an incident robbed me of all presence of mind and starting up i involuntarily exclaimed who is there an answer was immediately given the voice to my inexpressible astonishment was pleyels  it is i have you risen if you have not make haste i want three minutes conversation with you in the parlour  i will wait for you there saying this he retired from the door  should i confide in the testimony of my ears if that were true it was pleyel that had been hitherto immured in the opposite chamber he whom my rueful fancy had depicted in so many ruinous and ghastly shapes he whose footsteps had been listened to with such inquietude what is man that knowledge is so sparingly conferred upon him that his heart should be wrung with distress and his frame be exanimated with fear though his safety be encompassed with impregnable walls what are the bounds of human imbecility he that warned me of the presence of my foe refused the intimation by which so many racking fears would have been precluded  yet who would have imagined the arrival of pleyel at such an hour his tone was desponding and anxious why this unseasonable summons and why this hasty departure some tidings he perhaps bears of mysterious and unwelcome import  my impatience would not allow me to consume much time in deliberation i hastened down pleyel i found standing at a window with eyes cast down as in meditation and arms folded on his breast every line in his countenance was pregnant with sorrow to this was added a certain wanness and air of fatigue the last time i had seen him appearances had been the reverse of these i was startled at the change the first impulse was to question him as to the cause this impulse was supplanted by some degree of confusion flowing from a consciousness that love had too large and as it might prove a perceptible share in creating this impulse i was silent  presently he raised his eyes and fixed them upon me i read in them an anguish altogether ineffable never had i witnessed a like demeanor in pleyel never indeed had i observed an human countenance in which grief was more legibly inscribed he seemed struggling for utterance but his struggles being fruitless he shook his head and turned away from me  my impatience would not allow me to be longer silent what said i for heavens sake my friend what is the matter  he started at the sound of my voice his looks for a moment became convulsed with an emotion very different from grief his accents were broken with rage  the matter  o wretch  thus exquisitely fashioned  on whom nature seemed to have exhausted all her graces with charms so awful and so pure how art thou fallen from what height fallen a ruin so complete  so unheard of  his words were again choked by emotion grief and pity were again mingled in his features he resumed in a tone half suffocated by sobs  but why should i upbraid thee could i restore to thee what thou have lost efface this cursed stain snatch thee from the jaws of this fiend i would do it yet what will avail my efforts i have not arms with which to contend with so consummate so frightful a depravity  evidence less than this would only have excited resentment and scorn the wretch who should have breathed a suspicion injurious to thy honor would have been regarded without anger not hatred or envy could have prompted him it would merely be an argument of madness that my eyes that my ears should bear witness to thy fall by no other way could detestible conviction be imparted  why do i summon thee to this conference why expose myself to thy derision here admonition and entreaty are vain thou know him already for a murderer and thief i had thought to have been the first to disclose to thee his infamy to have warned thee of the pit to which thou art hastening but thy eyes are open in vain o foul and insupportable disgrace  there is but one path i know you will disappear together in thy ruin how will the felicity and honor of multitudes be involved but it must come this scene shall not be blotted by his presence no doubt thou will shortly see thy detested paramour this scene will be again polluted by a midnight assignation inform him of his danger tell him that his crimes are known let him fly far and instantly from this spot if he desires to avoid the fate which menaced him in ireland  and will thou not stay behind  but shame upon my weakness i know not what i would say  i have done what i purposed to stay longer to expostulate to beseech to enumerate the consequences of thy act  what end can it serve but to blazon thy infamy and embitter our woes and yet o think think ere it be too late on the distresses which thy flight will entail upon us on the base grovelling and atrocious character of the wretch to whom thou have sold thy honor but what is this is not thy effrontery impenetrable and thy heart thoroughly cankered o most specious and most profligate of women  saying this he rushed out of the house i saw him in a few moments hurrying along the path which led to my brothers i had no power to prevent his going or to recall or to follow him the accents i had heard were calculated to confound and bewilder i looked around me to assure myself that the scene was real i moved that i might banish the doubt that i was awake such enormous imputations from the mouth of pleyel to be stigmatized with the names of wanton and profligate to be charged with the sacrifice of honor with midnight meetings with a wretch known to be a murderer and thief with an intention to fly in his company  what i had heard was surely the dictate of phrenzy or it was built upon some fatal some incomprehensible mistake after the horrors of the night after undergoing perils so imminent from this man to be summoned to an interview like this to find pleyel fraught with a belief that instead of having chosen death as a refuge from the violence of this man i had hugged his baseness to my heart had sacrificed for him my purity my spotless name my friendships and my fortune that even madness could engender accusations like these was not to be believed  what evidence could possibly suggest conceptions so wild after the unlookedfor interview with carwin in my chamber he retired could pleyel have observed his exit it was not long after that pleyel himself entered did he build on this incident his odious conclusions could the long series of my actions and sentiments grant me no exemption from suspicions so foul was it not more rational to infer that carwins designs had been illicit that my life had been endangered by the fury of one whom by some means he had discovered to be an assassin and robber that my honor had been assailed not by blandishments but by violence  he has judged me without hearing he has drawn from dubious appearance conclusions the most improbable and unjust he has loaded me with all outrageous epithets he has ranked me with prostitutes and thieves i cannot pardon thee pleyel for this injustice thy understanding must be hurt if it be not if thy conduct was sober and deliberate i can never forgive an outrage so unmanly and so gross  these thoughts gradually gave place to others pleyel was possessed by some momentary phrenzy appearances had led him into palpable errors whence could his sagacity have contracted this blindness was it not love previously assured of my affection for carwin distracted with grief and jealousy and impelled hither at that late hour by some unknown instigation his imagination transformed shadows into monsters and plunged him into these deplorable errors  this idea was not unattended with consolation my soul was divided between indignation at his injustice and delight on account of the source from which i conceived it to spring for a long time they would allow admission to no other thoughts surprise is an emotion that enfeebles not invigorates all my meditations were accompanied with wonder i rambled with vagueness or clung to one image with an obstinacy which sufficiently testified the maddening influence of late transactions  gradually i proceeded to reflect upon the consequences of pleyels mistake and on the measures i should take to guard myself against future injury from carwin should i suffer this mistake to be detected by time when his passion should subside would he not perceive the flagrancy of his injustice and hasten to atone for it did it not become my character to testify resentiment for language and treatment so opprobrious wrapped up in the consciousness of innocence and confiding in the influence of time and reflection to confute so groundless a charge it was my province to be passive and silent  as to the violences meditated by carwin and the means of eluding them the path to be taken by me was obvious i resolved to tell the tale to my brother and regulate myself by his advice for this end when the morning was somewhat advanced i took the way to his house my sister was engaged in her customary occupations as soon as i appeared she remarked a change in my looks i was not willing to alarm her by the information which i had to communicate her health was in that condition which rendered a disastrous tale particularly unsuitable i forbore a direct answer to her inquiries and inquired in my turn for wieland  why said she i suspect something mysterious and unpleasant has happened this morning scarcely had we risen when pleyel dropped among us what could have prompted him to make us so early and so unseasonable a visit i cannot tell to judge from the disorder of his dress and his countenance something of an extraordinary nature has occurred he permitted me merely to know that he had slept none nor even undressed during the past night he took your brother to walk with him some topic must have deeply engaged them for wieland did not return till the breakfast hour was passed and returned alone his disturbance was excessive but he would not listen to my importunities or tell me what had happened i gathered from hints which he let fall that your situation was in some way the cause yet he assured me that you were at your own house alive in good health and in perfect safety he scarcely ate a morsel and immediately after breakfast went out again he would not inform me whither he was going but mentioned that he probably might not return before night  i was equally astonished and alarmed by this information pleyel had told his tale to my brother and had by a plausible and exaggerated picture instilled into him unfavorable thoughts of me yet would not the more correct judgment of wieland perceive and expose the fallacy of his conclusions perhaps his uneasiness might arise from some insight into the character of carwin and from apprehensions for my safety the appearances by which pleyel had been misled might induce him likewise to believe that i entertained an indiscreet though not dishonorable affection for carwin such were the conjectures rapidly formed i was inexpressibly anxious to change them into certainty for this end an interview with my brother was desirable he was gone no one knew whither and was not expected speedily to return i had no clue by which to trace his footsteps  my anxieties could not be concealed from my sister they heightened her solicitude to be acquainted with the cause there were many reasons persuading me to silence at least till i had seen my brother it would be an act of inexcusable temerity to unfold what had lately passed no other expedient for eluding her importunities occurred to me but that or returning to my own house i recollected my determination to become a tenant of this roof i mentioned it to her she joyfully acceded to this proposal and suffered me with less reluctance to depart when i told her that it was with a view to collect and send to my new dwelling what articles would be immediately useful to me  once more i returned to the house which had been the scene of so much turbulence and danger i was at no great distance from it when i observed my brother coming out on seeing me he stopped and after ascertaining as it seemed which way i was going he returned into the house before me i sincerely rejoiced at this event and i hastened to set things if possible on their right footing  his brow was by no means expressive of those vehement emotions with which pleyel had been agitated i drew a favorable omen from this circumstance without delay i began the conversation  i have been to look for you said i but was told by catharine that pleyel had engaged you on some important and disagreeable affair before his interview with you he spent a few minutes with me these minutes he employed in upbraiding me for crimes and intentions with which i am by no means chargeable i believe him to have taken up his opinions on very insufficient grounds his behavior was in the highest degree precipitate and unjust and until i receive some atonement i shall treat him in my turn with that contempt which he justly merits meanwhile i am fearful that he has prejudiced my brother against me that is an evil which i most anxiously deprecate and which i shall indeed exert myself to remove has he made me the subject of this mornings conversation  my brothers countenance testified no surprise at my address the benignity of his looks were no wise diminished  it is true said he your conduct was the subject of our discourse i am your friend as well as your brother there is no human being whom i love with more tenderness and whose welfare is nearer my heart judge then with what emotions i listened to pleyels story i expect and desire you to vindicate yourself from aspersions so foul if vindication be possible  the tone with which he uttered the last words affected me deeply if vindication be possible repeated i from what you know do you deem a formal vindication necessary can you harbor for a moment the belief of my guilt  he shook his head with an air of acute anguish i have struggled said he to dismiss that belief you speak before a judge who will profit by any pretense to acquit you who is ready to question his own senses when they plead against you  these words incited a new set of thoughts in my mind i began to suspect that pleyel had built his accusations on some foundation unknown to me i may be a stranger to the grounds of your belief pleyel loaded me with indecent and virulent invectives but he withheld from me the facts that generated his suspicions events took place last night of which some of the circumstances were of an ambiguous nature i conceived that these might possibly have fallen under his cognizance and that viewed through the mists of prejudice and passion they supplied a pretense for his conduct but believed that your more unbiassed judgment would estimate them at their just value perhaps his tale has been different from what i suspect it to be listen then to my narrative if there be any thing in his story inconsistent with mine his story is false  i then proceeded to a circumstantial relation of the incidents of the last night wieland listened with deep attention having finished this continued i is the truth you see in what circumstances an interview took place between carwin and me he remained for hours in my closet and for some minutes in my chamber he departed without haste or interruption if pleyel marked him as he left the house and it is not impossible that he did inferences injurious to my character might suggest themselves to him in admitting them he gave proofs of less discernment and less candor than i once ascribed to him  his proofs said wieland after a considerable pause are different that he should be deceived is not possible that he himself is not the deceiver could not be believed if his testimony were not inconsistent with yours but the doubts which i entertained are now removed your tale some parts of it is mavelous the voice which exclaimed against your rashness in approaching the closet your persisting notwithstanding that prohibition your belief that i was the ruffian and your subsequent conduct are believed by me because i have known you from childhood because a thousand instances have attested your veracity and because nothing less than my own hearing and vision would convince me in opposition to her own assertions that my sister had fallen into wickedness like this  i threw my arms around him and bathed his cheek with my tears that said i is spoken like my brother but what are the proofs  he replied  pleyel informed me that in going to your house his attention was attracted by two voices the persons speaking sat beneath the bank out of sight these persons judging by their voices were carwin and you i will not repeat the dialogue if my sister was the female pleyel was justified in concluding you to be indeed one of the most profligate of women hence his accusations of you and his efforts to obtain my concurrence to a plan by which an eternal separation should be brought about between my sister and this man  i made wieland repeat this recital here indeed was a tale to fill me with terrible foreboding i had vainly thought that my safety could be sufficiently secured by doors and bars but this is a foe from whose grasp no power of divinity can save me his artifices will ever lay my fame and happiness at his mercy how shall i counterwork his plots or detect his coadjutor he has taught some vile and abandoned female to mimic my voice pleyels ears were the witnesses of my dishonor this is the midnight assignation to which he alluded thus is the silence he maintained when attempting to open the door of my chamber accounted for he supposed me absent and meant perhaps had my apartment been accessible to leave in it some accusing memorial  pleyel was no longer equally culpable the sicerity of his anguish the depth of his despair i remembered with some tendencies to gratitude yet was he not precipitate was the conjecture that my part was played by some mimic so utterly untenable instances of this faculty are common the wickedness of carwin must in his opinion have been adequate to such contrivances and yet the supposition of my guilt was adopted in preference to that  but how was this error to be unveiled what but my own assertion had i to throw in the balance against it would this be permitted to outweigh the testimony of his senses i had no witnesses to prove my existence in another place the real events of that night are mavelous few to whom they should be related would scruple to discredit them pleyel is skeptical in a transcendant degree i cannot summon carwin to my bar and make him the attestor of my innocence and the accuser of himself  my brother saw and comprehended my distress he was unacquainted however with the full extent of it he knew not by how many motives i was incited to retrieve the good opinion of pleyel he endeavored to console me some new event he said would occur to disentangle the maze he did not question the influence of my eloquence if i thought proper to exert it why not seek an interview with pleyel and exact from him a minute relation in which something may be met with serving to destroy the probability of the whole  i caught with eagerness at this hope but my alacrity was damped by new reflections should i perfect in this respect and unblemished as i was thrust myself uncalled into his presence and make my felicity depend upon his arbitrary verdict  if you choose to seek an interview continued wieland you must make haste for pleyel informed me of his intention to set out this evening or tomorrow on a long journey  no intelligence was less expected or less welcome than this i had thrown myself in a window seat but now starting on my feet i exclaimed good heavens what is it you say a journey whither when  i cannot say whither it is a sudden resolution i believe i did not hear of it till this morning he promises to write to me as soon as he is settled  i needed no further information as to the cause and issue of this journey the scheme of happiness to which he had devoted his thoughts was blasted by the discovery of last night my preference of another and my unworthiness to be any longer the object of his adoration were evinced by the same act and in the same moment the thought of utter desertion a desertion originating in such a cause was the prelude to distraction that pleyel should abandon me forever because i was blind to his excellence because i coveted pollution and wedded infamy when on the contrary my heart was the shrine of all purity and beat only for his sake was a destiny which as long as my life was in my own hands i would by no means consent to endure  i remembered that this evil was still preventable that this fatal journey it was still in my power to procrastinate or perhaps to occasion it to be laid aside there were no impediments to a visit i only dreaded lest the interview should be too long delayed my brother befriended my impatience and readily consented to furnish me with a chaise and servant to attend me my purpose was to go immediately to pleyels farm where his engagements usually detained him during the day  chapter xii my way lay through the city i had scarcely entered it when i was seized with a general sensation of sickness every object grew dim and swam before my sight it was with difficulty i prevented myself from sinking to the bottom of the carriage i ordered myself to be carried to mrs bayntons in hope that an interval of repose would invigorate and refresh me my distracted thoughts would allow me but little rest growing somewhat better in the afternoon i resumed my journey  my contemplations were limited to a few objects i regarded my success in the purpose which i had in view as considerably doubtful i depended in some degree on the suggestions of the moment and on the materials which pleyel himself should furnish me when i reflected on the nature of the accusation i burned with disdain would not truth and the consciousness of innocence render me triumphant should i not cast from me with irresistible force such atrocious imputations  what an entire and mournful change has been effected in a few hours the gulf that separates man from insects is not wider than that which severs the polluted from the chaste among women yesterday and today i am  there is a degree of depravity to which it is impossible for me to sink yet in the apprehension of another my ancient and intimate associate the perpetual witness of my actions and partaker of my thoughts i had ceased to be the same my integrity was tarnished and withered in his eyes i was the colleague of a murderer and the paramour of a thief  his opinion was not destitute of evidence yet what proofs could reasonably avail to establish an opinion like this if the sentiments corresponded not with the voice that was heard the evidence was deficient but this want of correspondence would have been supposed by me if i had been the auditor and pleyel the criminal but mimicry might still more plausibly have been employed to explain the scene alas it is the fate of clara wieland to fall into the hands of a precipitate and inexorable judge  but what o man of mischief is the tendency of thy thoughts frustrated in thy first design thou will not forego the immolation of thy victim to exterminate my reputation was all that remained to thee and this my guardian has permitted to dispossess pleyel of this prejudice may be impossible but if that be effected it cannot be supposed that thy wiles are exhausted thy cunning will discover innumerable avenues to the accomplishment of thy malignant purpose  why should i enter the lists against thee would to heaven i could disarm thy vengeance by my deprecations when i think of all the resources with which nature and education have supplied thee that thy form is a combination of steely fibers and organs of exquisite ductility and boundless compass actuated by an intelligence gifted with infinite endowments and comprehending all knowledge i perceive that my doom is fixed what obstacle will be able to divert thy zeal or repel thy efforts that being who has hitherto protected me has borne testimony to the formidableness of thy attempts since nothing less than supernatural interference could check thy career  musing on these thoughts i arrived toward the close of the day at pleyels house a month before i had traversed the same path but how different were my sensations now i was seeking the presence of one who regarded me as the most degenerate of human kind i was to plead the cause of my innocence against witnesses the most explicit and unerring of those which support the fabric of human knowledge the nearer i approached the crisis the more did my confidence decay when the chaise stopped at the door my strength refused to support me and i threw myself into the arms of an ancient female domestic i had not courage to inquire whether her master was at home i was tormented with fears that the projected journey was already undertaken these sears were removed by her asking me whether she should call her young master who had just gone into his own room i was somewhat revived by this intelligence and resolved immediately to seek him there  in my confusion of mind i neglected to knock at the door but entered his apartment without previous notice this abruptness was altogether involuntary absorbed in reflections of such unspeakable moment i had no leisure to heed the niceties of punctilio i discovered him standing with his back toward the entrance a small trunk with its lid raised was before him in which it seemed as if he had been busy in packing his clothes the moment of my entrance he was employed in gazing at something which he held in his hand  i imagined that i fully comprehended this scene the image which he held before him and by which his attention was so deeply engaged i doubted not to be my own these preparations for his journey the cause to which it was to be imputed the hopelessness of success in the undertaking on which i had entered rushed at once upon my feelings and dissolved me into a flood of tears  startled by this sound he dropped the lid of the trunk and turned the solemn sadness that previously overspread his countenance gave sudden way to an attitude and look of the most vehement astonishment perceiving me unable to uphold myself he stepped toward me without speaking and supported me by his arm the kindness of this action called forth a new effusion from my eyes weeping was a solace to which at that time i had not grown familiar and which therefore was peculiarly delicious indignation was no longer to be read in the features of my friend they were pregnant with a mixture of wonder and pity their expression was easily interpreted this visit and these tears were tokens of my penitence the wretch whom he had stigmatized as incurably and obdurately wicked now showed herself susceptible of remorse and had come to confess her guilt  this persuasion had no tendency to comfort me it only showed me with new evidence the difficulty of the task which i had assigned myself we were mutually silent i had less power and less inclination than ever to speak i extricated myself from his hold and threw myself on a sofa he placed himself by my side and appeared to wait with impatience and anxiety for some beginning of the conversation what could i say if my mind had suggested any thing suitable to the occasion my utterance was suffocated by tears  frequently he attempted to speak but seemed deterred by some degree of uncertainty as to the true nature of the scene at length in faltering accents he spoke  my friend would to heaven i were still permitted to call you by that name the image that i once adored existed only in my fancy but though i cannot hope to see it realized you may not be totally insensible to the horrors of that gulf into which you are about to plunge what heart is forever exempt from the goadings of compunction and the influx of laudable propensities  i thought you accomplished and wise beyond the rest of women not a sentiment you uttered not a look you assumed that were not in my apprehension fraught with the sublimities of rectitude and the illuminations of genius deceit has some bounds your education could not be without influence a vigorous understanding cannot be utterly devoid of virtue but you could not counterfeit the powers of invention and reasoning i was rash in my invectives i will not but with life relinquish all hopes of you i will shut out every proof that would tell me that your heart is incurably diseased  you come to restore me once more to happiness to convince me that you have torn her mask from vice and feel nothing but abhorrence for the part you have hitherto acted  at these words my equanimity forsook me for a moment i forgot the evidence from which pleyels opinions were derived the benevolence of his remonstrances and the grief which his accents bespoke i was filled with indignation and horror at charges so black i shrunk back and darted at him a look of disdain and anger my passion supplied me with words  what detestable infatuation was it that led me hither why do i patiently endure these horrible insults my offenses exist only in your own distempered imagination you are leagued with the traitor who assailed my life you have vowed the destruction of my peace and honor i deserve infamy for listening to calumnies so base  these words were heard by pleyel without visible resentment his countenance relapsed into its former gloom but he did not even look at me the ideas which had given place to my angry emotions returned and once more melted me into tears o i exclaimed in a voice broken by sobs what a task is mine compelled to hearken to charges which i feel to be false but which i know to be believed by him that utters them believed too not without evidence which though fallacious is not unplausible  i came hither not to confess but to vindicate i know the source of your opinions wieland has informed me on what your suspicions are built these suspicions are softered by you as certainties the tenor of my life of all my conversations and letters affords me no security every sentiment that my tongue and my pen have uttered bear testimony to the rectitude of my mind but this testimony is rejected i am condemned as brutally profligate i am classed with the stupidly and sordidly wicked  and where are the proofs that must justify so foul and so improbable an accusation you have overheard a midnight conference voices have saluted your ear in which you imagine yourself to have recognized mine and that of a detected villain the sentiments expressed were not allowed to outweigh the casual or concerted resemblance of voice sentiments the reverse of all those whose influence my former life had attested denoting a mind polluted by grovelling vices and entering into compact with that of a thief and a murderer the nature of these sentiments did not enable you to detect the cheat did not suggest to you the possibility that my voice had been counterfeited by another  you were precipitate and prone to condemn instead of rushing on the impostors and comparing the evidence of sight with that of hearing you stood aloof or you fled my innocence would not now have stood in need of vindication if this conduct had been pursued that you did not pursue it your present thoughts incontestibly prove yet this conduct might surely have been expected from pleyel that he would not hastily impute the blackest of crimes that he would not couple my name with infamy and cover me with ruin for inadequate or slight reasons might reasonably have been expected the fobs which convulsed my bosom would not suffer me to proceed  pleyel was for a moment affected he looked at me with some expression of doubt but this quickly gave place to a mournful solemnity he fixed his eyes on the floor as in reverie and spoke  two hours hence i am gone shall i carry away with me the sorrow that is now my guest or shall that sorrow be accumulated tenfold what is she that is now before me shall every hour supply me with new proofs of a wickedness beyond example already i deem her the most abandoned and detestable of human creatures her coming and her tears imparted a gleam of hope but that gleam has vanished  he now fixed his eyes upon me and every muscle in his face trembled his tone was hollow and terrible  thou know that i was a witness of your interview yet thou come hither to upbraid me for injustice thou can look me in the face and say that i am deceived  an inscrutable providence has fashioned thee for some end thou will live no doubt to fulfill the purposes of thy maker if he repent not of his workmanship and send not his vengeance to exterminate thee ere the measure of thy days be full surely nothing in the shape of man can vie with thee  but i thought i had stifled this fury i am not constituted thy judge my office is to pity and amend and not to punish and revile i deemed myself exempt from all tempestuous passions i had almost persuaded myself to weep over thy fall but i am frail as dust and mutable as water i am calm i am compassionate only in thy absence  make this house this room thy abode as long as thou will but forgive me if i prefer solitude for the short time during which i shall stay saying this he motioned as if to leave the apartment  the stormy passions of this man affected me by sympathy i ceased to weep i was motionle and speechless with agony i sat with my han clasped mutely gazing after him as he withdrew i desired to detain him but was unable to ma any effort for that purpose till he had passed o of the room i then uttered an involuntary an piercing cry  pleyel art thou gone go forever  at this summons he hastily returned he behe me wild pale gasping for breath and my head aready sinking on my bosom a painful dizzine seized me and i fainted away  when i recovered i found myself stretched o a bed in the outer apartment and pleyel with  female servants standing beside it all the fury and scorn which the countenance of the former lately expressed had now disappeared and was succeeded by the most tender anxiety as soon as he perceived that my senses were returned to me he clasped his hands and exclaimed god be thanked you are once more alive i had almost despaired of your recovery i fear i have been precipitate and unjust my senses must have been the victims of some inexplicable and momentary phrenzy forgive me i beseech you forgive my reproaches i would purchase conviction of your purity at the price of my existence here and hereafter  he once more in a tone of the most fervent tenderness besought me to be composed and then left me to the care of the women  chapter xiii here was wrought a surprising change in my friend what was it that had shaken conviction so firm had any thing occurred during my fit adequate to produce so total an alteration my attendants informed me that he had not left my apartment that the unusual duration of my fit and the failure for a time of all the means used for my recovery had filled him with grief and dismay did he regard the effect which his reproaches had produced as a proof of my sincerity  in this state of mind i little regarded my languors of body i rose and requested an interview with him before my departure on which i was resolved notwithstanding his earnest solicitation to spend the night at his house he complied with my request the tenderness which he had lately betrayed had now disappeared and he once more relapsed into a chilling solemnity  i told him that i was preparing to return to my brothers that i had come hither to vindicate my innocence from the foul aspersions which he had cast upon it my pride had not taken refuge in silence or distance i had not relied upon time or the suggestions of his cooler thoughts to confute his charges conscious as i was that i was perfectly guiltless and entertaining some value for his good opinion i could not prevail upon myself to believe that my efforts to make my innocence manifest would be fruitless adverse appearances might be numerous and specious but they were unquestionably false i was willing to believe him sincere that he made no charges which he himself did not believe but these charges were destitute of truth the grounds of his opinion were fallacious and i desired an opportunity of detecting their fallacy i entreated him to be explicit and to give me a detail of what he had heard and what he had seen  at these words my companions countenance grew darker he appeared to be struggling with his rage he opened his lips to speak but his accents died away ere they were formed this conflict lasted for some minutes but his fortitude was finally successful he spoke as follows  i would fain put an end to this hateful scene what i shall say will be breath idly and unprofitably consumed the clearest narrative will add nothing to your present knowledge you are acquainted with the grounds of my opinion and yet you avow yourself innocent why then should i rehearse these grounds you are apprized of the character of carwin why then should i enumerate the discoveries which i have made respecting him yet since it is your request since considering the limitedness of human faculties some error may possibly lurk in those appearances which i have witnessed i will briefly relate what i know  need i dwell upon the impressions which your conversation and deportment originally made upon me we parted in childhood but our intercourse by letter was copious and uninterrupted how fondly did i anticipate a meeting with one whom her letters had previously taught me to consider as he first of women and how fully realized were he expectations that i had formed  here said i is a being after whom sages may model their transcendent intelligence and painters their ideal beauty here is exemplified that union between intellect and form which has hitherto existed only in the conceptions of the poet i have watched your eyes my attention has hung upon your lips i have questioned whether the enchantments of your voice were more conspicuous in the intricacies of melody or the emphasis of rhetoric i have marked the transitions of your discourse the felicities of your expression your refined argumentation and glowing imagery and been forced to acknowledge that all delights were meagre and contemptible compared with those connected with the audience and sight of you i have contemplated your principles and been astonished at the solidity of their foundation and the perfection of their structure i have traced you to your home i have viewed you in relation to your servants to your family to your neighbors and to the world i have seen by what skilful arrangements you facilitate the performance of the most arduous and complicated duties what daily accessions of strength your judicious discipline bestowed upon your memory what correctness and abundance of knowledge was daily experienced by your unwearied application to books and to writing it she that possesses so much in the bloom of youth will go on accumulating her stores what said i is the picture she will display at a mature age  you know not the accuracy of my observation i was desirous that others should profit by an example so rare i therefore noted down in writing every particular of your conduct i was anxious to benefit by an opportunity so seldom afforded us i labored not to omit the slightest shade or the most petty line in your portrait here there was no other task incumbent on me but to copy there was no need to exaggerate or overlook in order to produce a more unexceptionable pattern here was a combination of harmonies and graces incapable of diminution or accession without injury to its completeness  i found no end and no bounds to my task no display of a scene like this could be chargeable with redundancy or superfluity even the color of a shoe the knot of a ribband or your attitude in plucking a rose were of moment to be recorded even the arrangements of your breakfasttable and your toilet have been amply displayed  i know that mankind are more easily enticed to virtue by example than by precept i know that the absoluteness of a model when supplied by invention diminishes its salutary influence since it is useless we think to strive after that which we know to be beyond our reach but the picture which i drew was not a phantom as a model it was devoid of imperfection and to aspire to that height which had been really attained was by no means unreasonable i had another and more interesting object in view one existed who claimed all my tenderness here in all its parts was a model worthy of assiduous study and indefatigable imitation i called upon her as she wished to secure and enhance my esteem to mould her thoughts her words her countenance her actions by this pattern  the task was exuberant of pleasure and i was deeply engaged in it when an imp of mischief was let loose in the form of carwin i admired his powers and accomplishments i did not wonder that they were admired by you on the rectitude of your judgment however i relied to keep this admiration within discreet and scrupulous bounds i assured myself that the strangeness of his deportment and the obscurity of his life would teach you caution of all errors my knowledge of your character informed me that this was least likely to befall you  you were powerfully affected by his first appearance you were bewitched by his countenance and his tones your description was ardent and pathetic i listened to you with some emotions of surprise the portrait you drew in his absence and the intensity with which you mused upon it were new and unexpected incidents they bespoke a sensibility somewhat too vivid but from which while subjected to the guidance of an understanding like yours there was nothing to dread  a more direct intercourse took place between you i need not apologize for the solicitude which i entertained for your safety he that gifted me with perception of excellence compelled me to love it in the midst of danger and pain my contemplations have ever been cheered by your image every object in competition with you was worthless and trivial no price was too great by which your safety could be purchased for that end the sacrifice of ease of health and even of life would cheerfully have been made by me what wonder then that i scrutinized the sentiments and deportment of this man with ceaseless vigilance that i watched your words and your looks when he was present and that i extracted cause for the deepest inquietudes from every token which you gave of having put your happiness into this mans keeping  i was cautious in deciding i recalled the various conversations in which the topics of love and marriage had been discussed as a woman young beautiful and independent it behoved you to have fortified your mind with just principles on this subject your principles were eminently just had not their rectitude and their firmness been attested by your treatment of that specious seducer dashwood these principles i was prone to believe exempted you from danger in this new state of things i was not the last to pay my homage to the unrivalled capacity insinuation and eloquence of this man i have disguised but could never stifle the conviction that his eyes and voice had a witchcraft in them which rendered him truly formidable but i reflected on the ambiguous expression of his countenance  an ambiguity which you were the first to remark on the cloud which obscured his character and on the suspicious nature of that concealment which he studied and concluded you to be safe i denied the obvious construction to appearances i referred your conduct to some principle which had not been hitherto disclosed but which was reconcilable with those already known  i was not suffered to remain long in this suspense one evening you may recollect i came to your house where it was my purpose as usual to lodge somewhat earlier than ordinary i spied a light in your chamber as i approached from the outside and on inquiring of judith was informed that you were writing as your kinsman and friend and fellowlodger i thought i had a right to be familiar you were in your chamber but your employment and the time were such as to make it no infraction of decorum to follow you thither the spirit of mischievous gaiety possessed me i proceeded on tiptoe you did not perceive my entrance and i advanced softly till i was able to overlook your shoulder  i had gone thus far in error and had no power to recede how cautiously should we guard against the first inroads of temptation i knew that to pry into your papers was criminal but i reflected that no sentiment of yours was of a nature which made it your interest to conceal it you wrote much more than you permitted your friends to peruse my curiosity was strong and i had only to throw a glance upon the paper to secure its gratification i should never have deliberately committed an act like this the slightest obstacle would have repelled me but my eye glanced almost spontaneously upon the paper i caught only parts of sentences but my eyes comprehended more at a glance because the characters were shorthand i lighted on the words summer house midnight and made out a passage which spoke of the propriety and of the effects to be expected from another interview all this passed in less than a moment i then checked myself and made myself known to you by a tap upon your shoulder  i could pardon and account for some trifling alarm but your trepidation and blushes were excessive you hurried the paper out of sight and seemed too anxious to discover whether i knew the contents to allow yourself to make any inquiries i wondered at these appearances of consternation but did not reason on them until i had retired when alone these incidents suggested themselves to my reflections anew  to what scene or what interview i asked did you allude your disappearance on a former evening my tracing you to the recess in the bank your silence on my first and second call your vague answers and invincible embarrassment when you at length ascended the hill i recollected with new surprise could this be the summer house alluded to a certain timidity and consciousness had generally attended you when this incident and this recess had been the subjects of conversation nay i imagined that the last time that adventure was mentioned which happened in the presence of carwin the countenance of the latter betrayed some emotion could the interview have been with him  this was an idea calculated to rouse every faculty to contemplation an interview at that hour in this darksome retreat with a man of this mysterious but formidable character a clandestine interview and one which you afterward endeavored with so much solicitude to conceal it was a fearful and portentous occurrence i could not measure his power or fathom his designs had he rifled from you the secret of your love and reconciled you to concealment and nocturnal meetings i scarcely ever spent a night of more inquietude  i knew not how to act the ascertainment of this mans character and views seemed to be in the first place necessary had he openly preferred his suit to you we should have been empowered to make direct inquiries but since he had chosen this obscure path it seemed reasonable to infer that his character was exceptionable it at least subjected us to the necessity of resorting to other means of information yet the improbability that you should commit a deed of such rashness made me reflect anew upon the insufficiency of those grounds on which my suspicions had been built and almost to condemn myself for harboring them  though it was mere conjecture that the interview spoken of had taken place with carwin yet two ideas occurred to involve me in the most painful doubts this mans reasonings might be so specious and his artifices so profound that aided by the passion which you had conceived for him he had finally succeeded or his situation might be such as to justify the secrecy which you maintained in neither case did my wildest reveries suggest to me that your honor had been forfeited  i could not talk with you on this subject if the imputation was false its atrociousness would have justly drawn upon me your resentment and i must have explained by what facts it had been suggested if it were true no benefit would follow from the mention of it you had chosen to conceal it for some reasons and whether these reasons were true or false it was proper to discover and remove them in the first place finally i acquiesced in the least painful supposition trammelled as it was with perplexities that carwin was upright and that if the reasons of your silence were known they would be found to be just  chapter xiv three days have elapsed since this occurrence i have been haunted by perpetual inquietude to bring myself to regard carwin without terror and to acquiesce in the belief of your safety was impossible yet to put an end to my doubts seemed to be impracticable if some light could be reflected on the actual situation of this man a direct path would present itself if he were contrary to the tenor of his conversation cunning and malignant to apprize you of this would be to place you in security if he were merely unfortunate and innocent most readily would i espouse his cause and if his intentions were upright with regard to you most eagerly would i sanctify your choice by my approbation  it would be vain to call upon carwin for an avowal of his deeds it was better to know nothing than to be deceived by an artful tale what he was unwilling to communicate and this unwillingness had been repeatedly manifested could never be extorted from him importunity might be appeased or imposture effected by fallacious representations to the rest of the world he was unknown i had often made him the subject of discourse but a glimpse of his figure in the street was the sum of their knowledge who knew most none had ever seen him before and received as new the information which my intercourse with him in valencia and my present intercourse enabled me to give  wieland was your brother if he had really made you the object of his courtship was not a brother authorized to interfere and demand from him the confession of his views yet what were the grounds on which i had reared this supposition would they justify a measure like this surely not  in the course of my restless meditations it occurred to me at length that my duty required me to speak to you to confess the indecorum of which i had been guilty and to state the reflections to which it had led me i was prompted by no mean or selfish views the heart within my breast was not more precious than your safety most cheerfully would i have interposed my life between you and danger would you cherish resentment at my conduct when acquainted with the motive which produced it it would not only exempt me from censure but entitle me to gratitude  yesterday had been selected for the rehearsal of the newlyimported tragedy i promised to be present the state of my thoughts but little qualified me for a performer or auditor in such a scene but i reflected that after it was finished i should return home with you and should then enjoy an opportunity of discoursing with you fully on this topic my resolution was not formed without a remnant of doubt as to its propriety when i left this house to perform the visit i had promised my mind was full of apprehension and despondency the dubiousness of the event of our conversation fear that my interference was too late to secure your peace and the uncertainty to which hope gave birth whether i had not erred in believing you devoted to this man or at least in imagining that he had obtained your consent to midnight conferences distracted me with contradictory opinions and repugnant emotions  i can assign no reason for calling at mrs bayntons i had seen her in the morning and knew her to be well the concerted hour had nearly arrived and yet i turned up the street which leads to her house and dismounted at her door i entered the parlour and threw myself in a chair i saw and inquired for no one my whole frame was overpowered by dreary and comfortless sensations one idea possessed me wholly the inexpressible importance of unveiling the designs and character of carwin and the utter improbability that this ever would be effected some instinct induced me to lay my hand upon a newspaper i had perused all the general intelligence it contained in the morning and at the same spot the act was rather mechanical than voluntary  i threw a languid glance at the first column that presented itself the first words which i read began with the offer of a reward of three hundred guineas for the apprehension of a convict under sentence of death who had escaped from newgate prison in dublin good heaven how every fiber of my frame tingled when i proceeded to read that the name of the criminal was francis carwin  the descriptions of his person and address were minute his stature hair complexion the extraordinary position and arrangement of his features his awkward and disproportionate form his gesture and gait corresponded perfectly with those of our mysterious visitant he had been found guilty in two indictments one for the murder of the lady jane conway and the other for a robbery committed on the person of the honorable mr ludloe  i repeatedly perused this passage the ideas which flowed in upon my mind affected me like an instant transition from death to life the purpose dearest to my heart was thus effected at a time and by means the least of all others within the scope of my foresight but what purpose carwin was detected acts of the blackest and most sordid guilt had been committed by him here was evidence which imparted to my understanding the most luminous certainty the name visage and deportment were the same between the time of his escape and his appearance among us there was a sufficient agreement such was the man with whom i suspected you to maintain a clandestine correspondence should i not haste to snatch you from the talons of this vulture should i see you rushing to the verge of a dizzy precipice and not stretch forth a hand to pull you back i had no need to deliberate i thrust the paper in my pocket and resolved to obtain an immediate conference with you for a time no other image made its way to my understanding at length it occurred to me that though the information i possessed was in one sense sufficient yet if more could be obtained more was desirable this passage was copied from a british paper part of it only perhaps was transcribed the printer was in possession of the original  toward his house i immediately turned my horses head he produced the paper but i found nothing more than had already been seen while busy in perusing it the printer stood by my side he noticed the object of which i was in search aye said he that is a strange affair i should never have met with it had not mr hallet sent to me the paper with a particular request to republish that advertisement  mr hallet what reasons could he have for making this request had the paper sent to him been accompanied by any information respecting the convict had he personal or extraordinary reasons for desiring its republication this was to be known only in one way i speeded to his house in answer to my interrogations he told me that ludloe had formerly been in america and that during his residence in this city considerable intercourse had taken place between them hence a confidence arose which has since been kept alive by occasional letters he had lately received a letter from him enclosing the newspaper from which this extract had been made he put in into my hands and pointed out the passages which related to carwin  ludloe confirms the facts of his conviction and escape and adds that he had reason to believe him to have embarked for america he describes him in general terms as the most incomprehensible and formidable among men as engaged in schemes reasonably suspected to be in the highest degree criminal but such as no human intelligence is able to unravel that his ends are pursued by means which leave it in doubt whether he be not in league with some internal spirit that his crimes have hitherto been perpetrated with the aid of some unknown but desperate accomplices that he wages a perpetual war against the happiness of mankind and sets his engines of destruction at work against every object that presents itself  this is the substance of the letter hallet expressed some surprise at the curiosity which was manifested by me on this occasion i was too much absorbed by the ideas suggested by this letter to pay attention to his remarks i shuddered with the apprehension of the evil to which our indiscreet familiarity with this man had probably exposed us i burnt with impatience to see you and to do what in me lay to avert the calamity which threatened us it was already five oclock night was hastening and there was no time to be lost on leaving mr hallets house who should meet me in the street but bertrand the servant whom i left in germany his appearance and accoutrements bespoke him to have just alighted from a toilsome and long journey i was not wholly without expectation of seeing him about this time but no one was then more distant from my thoughts you know what reasons i have for anxiety respecting scenes with which this man was conversant carwin was for a moment forgotten in answer to my vehement inquiries bertrand produced a copious packet i shall not at present mention its contents nor the measures which they obliged me to adopt i bestowed a brief perusal on these papers and having given some directions to bertrand resumed my purpose with regard to you my horse i was obliged to resign to my servant he being charged with a commission that required speed the clock had struck ten and mettingen was five miles distant i was to journey thither on foot these circumstances only added to my expedition  as i passed swiftly along i reviewed all the incidents accompanying the appearance and deportment of that man among us late events have been inexplicable and mysterious beyond any of which i have either read or heard these events were coeval with carwins introduction i am unable to explain their origin and mutual dependence but i do not on that account believe them to have a supernatural original is not this man the agent some of them seem to be propitious but what should i think of those threats of assassination with which you were lately alarmed bloodshed is the trade and horror is the element of this man the process by which the sympathies of nature are extinguished in our hearts by which evil is made our good and by which we are made susceptible of no activity but in the infliction and no joy but in the spectacle of woes is an obvious process as to an alliance with evil geniuses the power and the malice of demons have been a thousand times exemplified in human beings there are no devils but those which are begotten upon selfishness and reared by cunning  now indeed the scene was changed it was not his secret poniard that i dreaded it was only the success of his efforts to make you a confederate in your own destruction to make your will the instrument by which he might bereave you of liberty and honor  i took as usual the path through your brothers ground i ranged with celerity and silence along the bank i approached the fence which divides wielands estate from yours the recess in the bank being near this line it being necessary for me to pass near it my mind being tainted with inveterate suspicions concerning you suspicions which were indebted for their strength to incidents connected with this spot what wonder that it seized upon my thoughts  i leaped on the fence but before i descended on the opposite side i paused to survey the scene leaves dropping with dew and glistening in the moons rays with no moving object to molest the deep repose filled me with security and hope i left the station at length and tended forward you were probably at rest how should i communicate without alarming you the intelligence of my arrival an immediate interview was to be procured i could not bear to think that a minute should be lost by remissness or hesitation should i knock at the door or should i stand under your chamber windows which i perceived to be open and awaken you by my calls  these reflections employed me as i passed opposite to the summer house i had scarcely gone by when my ear caught a sound unusual at this time and place it was almost too faint and too transient to allow me a distinct perception of it i stopped to listen presently it was heard again and now it was somewhat in a louder key it was laughter and unquestionably produced by a female voice that voice was familiar to my senses it was yours  whence it came i was at first at a loss to conjecture but this uncertainty vanished when it was heard the third time i threw back my eyes toward the recess every other organ and limb was useless to me i did not reason on the subject i did not in a direct manner draw my conclusions from the hour the place the hilarity which this sound betokened and the circumstance of having a companion which it no less incontestably proved in an instant as it were my heart was invaded with cold and the pulses of life at a stand  why should i go further why should i return should i not hurry to a distance from a sound which though formerly so sweet and delectable was now more hideous than the shrieks of owls  i had no time to yield to this impulse the thought of approaching and listening occurred to me i had no doubt of which i was conscious yet my certainty was capable of increase i was likewise stimulated by a sentiment that partook of rage i was governed by an halfformed and tempestuous resolution to break in upon your interview and strike you dead with my upbraiding  i approached with the utmost caution when i reached the edge of the bank immediately above the summer house i thought i heard voices from below as busy in conversation the steps in the rock are clear of bushy impediments they allowed me to descend into a cavity beside the building without being detected thus to lie in wait could only be justified by the momentousness of the occasion  here pleyel paused in his narrative and fixed his eyes upon me situated as i was my horror and astonishment at this tale gave way to compassion for the anguish which the countenance of my friend betrayed i reflected on his force of understanding i reflected on the powers of my enemy i could easily divine the substance of the conversation that was overheard carwin had constructed his plot in a manner suited to the characters of those whom he had selected for his victims i saw that the convictions of pleyel were immutable i forbore to struggle against the storm because i saw that all struggles would be fruitless i was calm but my calmness was the torpor of despair and not the tranquillity of fortitude it was calmness invincible by any thing that his grief and his fury could suggest to pleyel he resumed   woman will thou hear me further shall i go on to repeat the conversation is it shame that makes thee tonguetied shall i go on or art thou satisfied with what has been already said  i bowed my head go on said i i make not this request in the hope of undeceiving you i shall no longer contend with my own weakness the storm is let loose and i shall peaceably submit to be driven by its fury but go on this conference will end only with affording me a clearer foresight of my destiny but that will be some satisfaction and i will not part without it  why on hearing these words did pleyel hesitate did some unlookedfor doubt insinuate itself into his mind was his belief suddenly shaken by my looks or my words or by some newly recollected circumstance whencesoever it arose it could not endure the test of deliberation in a few minutes the flame of resentment was again lighted up in his bosom he proceeded with his accustomed vehemence   i hate myself for this folly i can find no apology for this tale yet i am irresistibly impelled to relate it she that hears me is apprized of every particular i have only to repeat to her her own words she will listen with a tranquil air and the spectacle of her obduracy will drive me to some desperate act why then should i persist yet persist i must  again he paused no said he it is impossible to repeat your avowals of love your appeals to former confessions of your tenderness to former deeds of dishonor to the circumstances of the first interview that took place between you it was on that night when i traced you to this recess thither had he enticed you and there had you ratified an unhallowed compact by admitting him   great god thou witnessedst the agonies that tore my bosom at that moment thou witnessedst my efforts to repel the testimony of my ears it was in vain that you dwelt upon the confusion which my unlookedfor summons excited in you the tardiness with which a suitable excuse occurred to you your resentment that my impertinent intrusion had put an end to that charming interview a disappointment for which you endeavored to compensate yourself by the frequency and duration of subsequent meetings  in vain you dwelt upon incidents of which you only could be conscious incidents that occurred on occasions on which none beside your own family were witnesses in vain was your discourse characterized by peculiarities inimitable of sentiment and language my conviction was effected only by an accumulation of the same tokens i yielded not but to evidence which took away the power to withhold my faith  my sight was of no use to me beneath so thick an umbrage the darkness was intense hearing was the only avenue to information which the circumstances allowed to be open i was couched within three feet of you why should i approach nearer i could not contend with your betrayer what could be the purpose of a contest you stood in no need of a protector what could i do but retire from the spot overwhelmed with confusion and dismay i sought my chamber and endeavored to regain my composure the door of the house which i found open your subsequent entrance closing and fastening it and going into your chamber which had been thus long deserted were only confirmations of the truth  why should i paint the tempestuous fluctuation of my thoughts between grief and revenge between rage and despair why should i repeat my vows of eternal implacability and persecution and the speedy recantation of these vows  i have said enough you have dismissed me from a place in your esteem what i think and what i feel is of no importance in your eyes may the duty which i owe myself enable me to forget your existence in a few minutes i go hence be the maker of your fortune and may adversity instruct you in that wisdom which education was unable to impart to you  those were the last words which pleyel uttered he left the room and my new emotions enabled me to witness his departure without any apparent loss of composure as i sat alone i ruminated on these incidents nothing was more evident than that i had taken an eternal leave of happiness life was a worthless thing separate from that good which had now been wrested from me yet the sentiment that now possessed me had no tendency to palsy my exertions and overbear my strength i noticed that the light was declining and perceived the propriety of leaving this house i placed myself again in the chaise and returned slowly toward the city  chapter xv before i reached the city it was dusk it was my purpose to spend the night at mettingen i was not solicitous as long as i was attended by a faithful servant to be there at an early hour my exhausted strength required me to take some refreshment with this view and in order to pay respect to one whose affection for me was truly maternal i stopped at mrs bayntons she was absent from home but i had scarcely entered the house when one of her domestics presented me a letter i opened and read as follows to clara wieland what shall i say to extenuate the misconduct of last night it is my duty to repair it to the utmost of my power but the only way in which it can be repaired you will not i fear be prevailed on to adopt it is by granting me an interview at your own house at eleven oclock this night i have no means of removing any fears that you may entertain of my designs but my simple and solemn declarations these after what has passed between us you may deem unworthy of confidence i cannot help it my folly and rashness has left me no other resource i will be at your door by that hour if you choose to admit me to a conference provided that conference has no witnesses i will disclose to you particulars the knowledge of which is of the utmost importance to your happiness farewell  carwin     what a letter was this a man known to be an assassin and robber one capable of plotting against my life and my fame detected lurking in my chamber and avowing designs the most flagitious and dreadful now solicits me to grant him a midnight interview to admit him alone into my presence could he make this request with the expectation of my compliance what had he seen in me that could justify him in admitting so wild a belief yet this request is preferred with the utmost gravity it is not accompanied by an appearance of uncommon earnestness had the misconduct to which he alludes been a flight incivility and the interview requested to take place in the midst of my friends there would have been no extravagance in the tenor of this letter but as it was the writer had surely been bereft of his reason  i perused this epistle frequently the request it contained might be called audacious or stupid if it had been made by a different person but from carwin who could not be unaware of the effect which it must naturally produce and of the manner in which it would unavoidably be treated it was perfectly inexplicable he must have counted on the success of some plot in order to extort my assent none of those motives by which i am usually governed would ever have persuaded me to meet any one of his sex at the time and place which he had prescribed much less would i consent to a meeting with a man tainted with the most detestable crimes and by whose arts my own safety had been so imminently endangered and my happiness irretrievably destroyed i shuddered at the idea that such a meeting was possible i felt some reluctance to approach a spot which he still visited and haunted  such were the ideas which first suggested themselves on the perusal of the letter meanwhile i resumed my journey my thoughts still dwelt upon the same topic gradually from ruminating on this epistle i reverted to my interview with pleyel i recalled the particulars of the dialogue to which he had been an auditor my heart sunk anew on viewing the inextricable complexity of this deception and the inauspicious concurrence of events which tended to confirm him in his error when he approached my chamber door my terror kept me mute he put his ear perhaps to the crevice but it caught the sound of nothing human had i called or made any token that denoted some one to be within words would have ensued and as omnipresence was impossible this discovery and the artless narrative of what had just passed would have saved me from his murderous invectives he went into his chamber and after some interval i stole across the entry and down the stairs with inaudible steps having secured the outer doors i returned with less circumspection he heard me not when i descended but my returning steps were easily distinguished now he thought was the guilty interview at an end in what other way was it possible for him to construe these signals  how fallacious and precipitate was my decision carwins plot owed its success to a coincidence of events scarcely credible the balance was swayed from its equipoise by a hair had i even begun the conversation with an account of what befell me in my chamber my previous interview with wieland would have taught him to suspect me of imposture yet if i were discoursing with this ruffian when pleyel touched the lock of my chamber door and when he shut his own door with so much violence how he might ask should i be able to relate these incidents perhaps he had withheld the knowledge of these circumstances from my brother from whom therefore i could not obtain it so that my innocence would have thus been irresistibly demonstrated  the first impulse which flowed from these ideas was to return upon my steps and demand once more an interview but he was gone his parting declarations were remembered  pleyel i exclaimed thou art gone for ever are thy mistakes beyond the reach of detection am i helpless in the midst of this snare the plotter is at hand he even speaks in the style of penitence he solicits an interview which he promises shall end in the disclosure of something momentous to my happiness what can he say which will avail to turn aside this evil but why should his remorse be feigned i have done him no injury his wickedness is fertile only of despair and the billows of remorse will some time overbear him why may not this event have already taken place why should i refuse to see him  this idea was present as it were for a moment i suddenly recoiled from it confounded at that frenzy which could give even momentary harbor to such a scheme yet presently it returned a length i even conceived it to deserve deliberation i questioned whether it was not proper to admit at a lonely spot in a sacred hour this man of tremendous and inscrutable attributes this performer o horrid deeds and whose presence was predicted to call down unheard of and unutterable horrors  what was it that swayed me i felt myself divested of the power to will contrary to the motive that determined me to seek his presence my mind seemed to be split into separate parts and these parts to have entered into furious and implacable contention these tumults gradually subsided the reasons why i should confide in that interposition which had hitherto defended me in those tokens of compunction which this letter contained in the efficacy of this interview to restore its spotlessness to my character and banish all illusions from the mind of my friend continually acquired new evidence and new strength  what should i fear in his presence this was unlike an artifice intended to betray me into his hands if it were an artifice what purpose would it serve the freedom of my mind was untouched and that freedom would defy the assaults of blandishments or magic force was i not able to repel on the former occasion my courage it is true had failed at the imminent approach of danger but then i had not enjoyed opportunities of deliberation i had foreseen nothing i was sunk into imbecility by my previous thoughts i had been the victim of recent disappointments and anticipated ills witness my infatuation in opening the closet in opposition to divine injunctions  now perhaps my courage was the offspring of a no less erring principle pleyel was for ever ost to me i strove in vain to assume his person and suppress my resentment i strove in vain to believe in the assuaging influence of time to look forward to the birthday of new hopes and the reexaltation of that luminary of whose effulgencies i had so long and so liberally partaken  what had i to suffer worse than was already inflicted  was not carwin my foe i owed my untimely  to his treason instead of flying from his presence ought i not to devote all my faculties to the gaining of an interview and compel him to repair the ills of which he has been the author why should i suppose him impregnable to argument have i not reason on my side and the power of imparting conviction cannot he be made to see the justice of unravelling the maze in which pleyel is bewildered  he may at least be accessible to fear has he nothing to fear from the rage of an injured woman but suppose him inaccessible to such inducements suppose him to persist in all his flagitious purposes are not the means of defense and resistance in my power  in the progress of such thoughts was the resolution at last formed i hoped that the interview was sought by him for a laudable end but be that as it would i trusted that by energy of reasoning or of action i should render it auspicious or at least harmless  such a determination must unavoidably fluctuate the poets chaos was no unapt emblem of the state of my mind a torment was awakened in my bosom which i foresaw would end only when this interview was past and its consequences fully experienced hence my impatience for the arrival of the hour which had been prescribed by carwin  meanwhile my meditations were tumultuously active new impediments to the execution of the scheme were speedily suggested i had apprized catharine of my intention to spend this and many future nights with her her husband was informed of this arrangement and had zealously approved it eleven oclock exceeded their hour of retiring what excuse should i form for changing my plan should i show this letter to wieland and submit myself to his direction but i knew in what way he would decide he would servently dissuade me from going nay would he not do more he was apprized of the offenses of carwin and of the reward offered for his apprehension would he not seize this opportunity of executing justice on a criminal  this idea was new i was plunged once more into doubt did not equity enjoin me thus to facilitate his arrest no i disdained the office of betrayer carwin was unapprized of his danger and his intentions were possibly beneficent should i station guards about the house and make an act intended perhaps for my benefit instrumental to his own destruction wieland might be justified in thus employing the knowledge which i should impart but i by imparting it should pollute myself with more hateful crimes than those undeservedly imputed to me this scheme therefore i unhesitatingly rejected the views with which i should return to my own house it would therefore be necessary to conceal yet some pretext must be invented i had never been initiated into the trade of lying yet what but falsehood was a deliberate suppression of the truth to deceive by silence or by words is the same  yet what would a lie avail me what pretext would justify this change in my plan would it not tend to confirm the imputations of pleyel that i should voluntarily return to an house in which honor and life had so lately been endangered could be explained in no way favorable to my integrity  these reflections if they did not change at least suspended my decision in this state of uncertainty i alighted at the hut we gave this name to the house tenanted by the farmer and his servants and which was situated on the verge of my brothers ground and at a considerable distance from the mansion the path to the mansion was planted by a double row of walnuts along this path i proceeded alone i entered the parlour in which was a light just expiring in the socket there was no one in the room i perceived by the clock that stood against the wall that it was near eleven the lateness of the hour startled me what had become of the family they were usually retired an hour before this but the unextinguished taper and the unbarred door were indications that they had not retired i again returned to the hall and passed from one room to another but still encountered not a human being  i imagined that perhaps the lapse of a few minutes would explain these appearances meanwhile i reflected that the preconcerted hour had arrived carwin was perhaps waiting my approach should i immediately retire to my own house no one would be apprized of my proceeding nay the interview might pass and i be enabled to return in half an hour hence no necessity would arise for dissimulation  i was so far influenced by these views that i rose to execute this design but again the unusual condition of the house occurred to me and some vague solicitude as to the condition of the family i was nearly certain that my brother had not retired but by what motives he could be induced to desert his house thus unseasonably i could by no means divine louisa conway at least was at home and had probably retired to her chamber perhaps she was able to impart the information i wanted  i went to her chamber and found her asleep she was delighted and surprised at my arrival and told me with how much impatience and anxiety my brother and his wife had waited my coming they were fearful that some mishap had befallen me and had remained up longer than the usual period notwithstanding the lateness of the hour catharine would not resign the hope of seeing me louisa said she had left them both in the parlour and she knew of no cause for their absence  as yet i was not without solicitude on account of their personal safety i was far from being perfectly at ease on that head but entertained no distinct conception of the danger that impended over them perhaps to beguile the moments of my long protracted stay they had gone to walk upon the bank the atmosphere though illuminated only by the starlight was remarkably serene meanwhile the desireableness of an interview with carwin again returned and i finally resolved to seek it  i passed with doubting and hasty steps along the path my dwelling seen at a distance was gloomy and desolate it had no inhabitant for my servant in consequence of my new arrangement had gone to mettingen the temerity of this attempt began to show itself in more vivid colors to my understanding whoever has pointed steel is not without arms yet what must have been the state of my mind when i could meditate without shuddering on the use of a murderous weapon and believe myself secure merely because i was capable of being made so by the death of another yet this was not my state i felt as if i was rushing into deadly toils without the power of pausing or receding  chapter xvi as soon as i arrived in sight of the front of the house my attention was excited by a light from the window of my own chamber no appearance could be less explicable a meeting was expected with carwin but that he preoccupied my chamber and had supplied himself with light was not to be believed what motive could influence him to adopt this conduct could i proceed until this was explained perhaps if i should proceed to a distance in front some one would be visible a sidelong but feeble beam from the window fell upon the piny copse which skirted the bank as i eyed it it suddenly became mutable and after flitting to and fro for a short time it vanished i turned my eye again toward the window and perceived that the light was still there but the change which i had noticed was occasioned by a change in the position of the lamp or candle within hence that some person was there was an unavoidable inference  i paused to deliberate on the propriety of advancing might i not advance cautiously and therefore without danger might i not knock at the door or call and be apprized of the nature of my visitant before i entered i approached and listened at the door but could hear nothing i knocked at first timidly but afterward with loudness my signals were unnoticed i stepped back and looked but the light was no longer discernible was it suddenly extinguished by a human agent what purpose but concealment was intended why was the illumination produced to be thus suddenly brought to an end and why since some one was there had silence been observed  these were questions the solution of which may be readily supposed to be entangled with danger would not this danger when measured by a womans fears expand into gigantic dimensions menaces of death the stunning exertions of a warning voice the known and unknown attributes of carwin our recent interview in this chamber the preappointment of a meeting at this place and hour all thronged into my memory what was to be done  courage is no definite or steadfast principle let that man who shall purpose to assign motives to the actions of another blush at his folly and forbear not more presumptuous would it be to attempt the classification of all nature and the scanning of supreme intelligence i gazed for a minute at the window and fixed my eyes for a second minute on the ground i drew forth from my pocket and opened a penknife this said i be my safeguard and avenger the assailant shall perish or myself shall fall  i had locked up the house in the morning but had the key of the kitchen door in my pocket i therefore determined to gain access behind thither i hastened unlocked and entered all was lonely darksome and waste familiar as i was with every part of my dwelling i easily found my way to a closet drew forth a taper a flint tinder and steel and in a moment as it were gave myself the guidance and protection of light  what purpose did i meditate should i explore my way to my chamber and confront the being who had dared to intrude into this recess and had labored for concealment by putting out the light did he seek to hide himself or mean only to circumvent my incautious steps yet was it not more probable that he desired my absence by thus encouraging the supposition that the house was unoccupied i would see this man in spite of all impediments ere i died i would see his face and summon him to penitence and retribution no matter at what cost an interview was purchased reputation and life might be wrested from me by another but my rectitude and honor were in my own keeping and were safe  i proceeded to the foot of the stairs at such a crisis my thoughts may be supposed at no liberty to range yet vague images rushed into my mind of the mysterious interposition which had been experienced on the last night my case at present was not dissimilar and if my angel were not weary of fruitless exertions to save might not a new warning be expected who could say whether his silence were ascribable to the absence of danger or to his own absence  in this state of mind no wonder that a shivering cold crept through my veins that my pause was prolonged and that a fearful glance was thrown backward  alas my heart droops and my fingers are enervated my ideas are vivid but my language is faint now know i what it is to entertain incommunicable sentiments the chain of subsequent incidents is drawn through my mind and being linked with those which forewent by turns rouse up agonies and sink me into hopelessness  yet i will persist to the end my narrative may be invaded by inaccuracy and confusion but if i live no longer i will at least live to complete it what but ambiguities abruptnesses and dark transitions can be expected from the historian who is at the same time the sufferer of these disasters  i have said that i cast a look behind some object was expected to be seen or why should i have gazed in that direction two senses were at once assailed the same piercing exclamation of hold hold was uttered within the same distance of my ear this it was that i heard the airy undulation and the shock given to my nerves were real whether the spectacle which i beheld existed in my fancy or without might be doubted  i had not closed the door of the apartment i had just left the staircase at the foot of which i stood was eight or ten feet from the door and attached to the wall through which the door led my view therefore was sidelong and took in no part of the room  through this aperture was an head thrust and drawn back with so much swiftness that the immediate conviction was that thus much of a form ordinarily invisible had been unshrowded the face was turned toward me every muscle was tense the forehead and brows were drawn into vehement expression the lips were stretched as in the act of shrieking and the eyes emitted sparks which no doubt if i had been unattended by a light would have illuminated like the corruscations of a meteor the sound and the vision were present and departed together at the same instant but the cry was blown into my ear while the face was many paces distant  this face was well suited to a being whose performances exceeded the standard of humanity and yet its features were akin to those i had before seen the image of carwin was blended in a thousand ways with the stream of my thoughts this visage was perhaps pourtrayed by my fancy if so it will excite no surprise that some of his lineaments were now discovered yet affinities were few and unconspicuous and were lost amidst the blaze of opposite qualities  what conclusion could i form be the face human or not the intimation was imparted from above experience had evinced the benignity of that being who gave it once he had interposed to shield me from harm and subsequent events demonstrated the usefulness of that interposition now was i again warned to forbear i was hurrying to the verge of the same gulf and the same power was exerted to recall my steps was it possible for me not to obey was i capable of holding on in the same perilous career yes even of this i was capable  the intimation was imperfect it gave no form to my danger and prescribed no limits to my caution i had formerly neglected it and yet escaped might i not trust to the same issue this idea might possess though imperceptibly some influence i persisted but it was not merely on this account i cannot delineate the motives that led me on i now speak as if no remnant of doubt existed in my mind as to the supernal origin of these sounds but this is owing to the imperfection of my language for i only mean that the belief was more permanent and visited more frequently my sober meditations than its opposite the immediate effects served only to undermine the foundations of my judgment and precipitate my resolutions  i must either advance or return i chose the former and began to ascend the stairs the silence underwent no second interruption my chamber door was closed but unlocked and aided by vehement efforts of my courage i opened and looked in  no hideous or uncommon object was discernible the danger indeed might easily have lurked out of sight have sprung upon me as i entered and have rent me with his iron talons but i was blind to this fate and advanced though cautiously into the room  still every thing wore its accustomed aspect neither lamp nor candle was to be found now for the first time suspicions were suggested as to the nature of the light which i had seen was it possible to have been the companion of that supernatural visage a meteorous refulgence producible at the will of him to whom that visage belonged and partaking of the nature of that which accompanied my fathers death  the closet was near and i remembered the complicated horrors of which it had been productive here perhaps was enclosed the source of my peril and the gratification of my curiosity should i adventure once more to explore its recesses this was a resolution not easily formed i was suspended in thought when glancing my eye on a table i perceived a written paper carwins hand was instantly recognized and snatching up the paper i read as follows   there was folly in expecting your compliance with my invitation judge how i was disappointed in finding another in your place i have waited but to wait any longer would be perilous i shall still seek an interview but it must be at a different time and place meanwhile i will write this  how will you bear  how inexplicable will be this transaction  an event so unexpected  a sight so horrible  such was this abrupt and unsatisfactory script the ink was yet moist the hand was that of carwin hence it was to be inferred that he had this moment left the apartment or was still in it i looked back on the sudden expectation of seeing him behind me  what other did he mean what transaction had taken place adverse to my expectations what sight was about to be exhibited i looked around me once more but saw nothing which indicated strangeness again i remembered the closet and was resolved to seek in that the solution of these mysteries here perhaps was enclosed the scene destined to awaken my horrors and baffle my foresight  i have already said that the entrance into this closet was beside my bed which on two sides was closely shrouded by curtains on that side nearest the closet the curtain was raised as i passed along i cast my eye thither i started and looked again i bore a light in my hand and brought it nearer my eyes in order to dispel any illusive mists that might have hovered before them once more i fixed my eyes upon the bed in hope that this more steadfast scrutiny would annihilate the object which before seemed to be there  this then was the sight which carwin had predicted this was the event which my understanding was to find inexplicable this was the fate which had been reserved for me but which by some untoward chance had befallen on another  i had not been terrified by empty menaces violation and death awaited my entrance into this chamber some inscrutable chance had led her hither before me and the merciless fangs of which i was designed to be the prey had mistaken their victim and had fixed themselves in her heart but where was my safety was the mischief exhausted or flown the steps of the assassin had just been here they could not be far off in a moment he would rush into my presence and i should perish under the same polluting and suffocating grasp  my frame shook and my knees were unable to support me i gazed alternately at the closet door and at the door of my room at one of these avenues would enter the exterminator of my honor and my life i was prepared for defense but now that danger was imminent my means of defense and my power to use them were gone i was not qualified by education and experience to encounter perils like these or perhaps i was powerless because i was again assaulted by surprise and had not fortified my mind by foresight and previous reflection against a scene like this  fears for my own safety again yielded place to reflections on the scene before me i fixed my eyes upon her countenance my sisters wellknown and beloved features could not be concealed by convulsion or lividness what direful illusion led thee hither bereft of thee what hold on happiness remains to thy offspring and thy spouse to lose thee by a common fate would have been sufficiently hard but thus suddenly to perish  to become the prey of this ghastly death how will a spectacle like this be endured by wieland to die beneath his grasp would not satisfy thy enemy this was mercy to the evils which he previously made thee suffer after these evils death was a boon which thou besoughtest him to grant he entertained no enmity against thee i was the object of his treason but by some tremendous mistake his fury was misplaced but how come thou hither and where was wieland in thy hour of distress  i approached the corpse i lifted the still flexible hand and kissed the lips which were breatless her flowing drapery was discomposed i restored it to order and seating myself on the bed again fixed steadfast eyes upon her countenance i cannot distinctly recollect the ruminations of that moment i saw confusedly but forcibly that every hope was extinguished with the life of catharine all happiness and dignity must henceforth be banished from the house and name of wieland all that remained was to linger out in agonies a short existence and leave to the world a monument of blasted hopes and changeable fortune pleyel was already lost to me yet while catharine lived life was not a detestable possession but now severed from the companion of my infancy the partaker of all my thoughts my cares and my wishes i was like one set afloat upon a stormy sea and hanging his safety upon a plank night was closing upon him and an unexpected surge had torn him from his hold and overwhelmed him forever  chapter xvii i had no inclination nor power to move from this spot for more than an hour my faculties and limbs seemed to be deprived of all activity the door below creaked on its hinges and steps ascended the stairs my wandering and confused thoughts were instantly recalled by these sounds and dropping the curtain of the bed i moved to a part of the room where any one who entered should be visible such are the vibrations of sentiment that notwithstanding the seeming fulfillment of my fears and increase of my danger i was conscious on this occasion to no turbulence but that of curiosity  at length he entered the apartment and i recognized my brother it was the same wieland whom i had ever seen yet his features were pervaded by a new expression i supposed him unacquainted with the fate of his wife and his appearance confirmed this persuasion a brow expanding into exultation i had hitherto never seen in him yet such a brow did he now wear not only was he unapprized of the disaster that had happened but some joyous occurrence had betided what a reverse was preparing to annihilate his transitory bliss no husband ever doated more fondly for no wife ever claimed so boundless a devotion i was not uncertain as to the effects to flow from the discovery of her fate i confided not at all in the efforts of his reason or his piety there were few evils which his modes of thinking would not disarm of their sting but here all opiates to grief and all compellers of patience were vain this spectacle would be unavoidably followed by the outrages of desperation and a rushing to death  for the present i neglected to ask myself what motive brought him hither i was only fearful of the effects to flow from the sight of the dead yet could it be long concealed from him some time and speedily he would obtain this knowledge no stratagems could considerably or usefully prolong his ignorance all that could be sought was to take away the abruptness of the change and shut out the confusion of despair and the inroads of madness but i knew my brother and knew that all exertions to console him would be fruitless  what could i say i was mute and poured forth those tears on his account which my own unhappiness had been unable to extort in the midst of my tears i was not unobservant of his motions these were of a nature to rouse some other sentiment than grief or at least to mix with it a portion of astonishment  his countenance suddenly became troubled his hands were clasped with a force that left the print of his nails in his flesh his eyes were fixed on my feet his brain seemed to swell beyond its continent he did not cease to breathe but his breath was stifled into groans i had never witnessed the hurricane of human passions my element had till lately been all sunshine and calm i was unconversant with the altitudes and energies of sentiment and was transfixed with inexplicable horror by the symptoms which i now beheld  after a silence and a conflict which i could not interpret he lifted his eyes to heaven and in broken accents exclaimed this is too much any vicam but this and thy will be done have i not sufficiently attested my faith and my obedience she that is gone they that have perished were linked with my soul by ties which only thy command would have broken but here is sanctity and excellence surpassing human this workmanship is thine and it cannot be thy will to heap it into ruins  here suddenly unclasping his hands he struck one of them against his forehead and continued  wretch who made thee quicksighted in the councils of thy maker deliverance from mortal fetters is awarded to this being and thou art the minister of this decree  so saying wieland advanced toward me his words and his motions were without meaning except on one supposition the death of catharine was already known to him and that knowledge as might have been suspected had destroyed his reason i had feared nothing less but now that i beheld the extinction of a mind the most luminous and penetrating that ever dignified the human form my sensations were fraught with new and insupportable anguish  i had not time to reflect in what way my own safety would be effected by this revolution or what i had to dread from the wild conceptions of a madman he advanced toward me some hollow noises were wafted by the breeze confused clamours were succeeded by many feet traversing the grass and then crowding into the piazza  these sounds suspended my brothers purpose and he stood to listen the signals multiplied and grew louder perceiving this he turned from me and hurried out of my sight all about me was pregnant with motives to astonishment my sisters corpse wielands frantic demeanor and at length this crowd of visitants so little accorded with my foresight that my mental progress was stopped the impulse had ceased which was accustomed to give motion and order to my thoughts  footsteps thronged upon the stairs and presently many faces showed themselves within the door of my apartment these looks were full of alarm and watchfulness they pryed into corners as if in search of some fugitive next their gaze was fixed upon me and betokened all the vehemence of terror and pity for a time i questioned whether these were not shapes and faces like that which i had seen at the bottom of the stairs creatures of my fancy or airy existences  my eye wandered from one to another till at length it fell on a countenance which i well knew it was that of mr hallet this man was a distant kinsman of my mother venerable for his age his uprightness and sagacity he had long discharged the functions of a magistrate and good citizen if any terrors remained his presence was sufficient to dispel them  he approached took my hand with a compassionate air and said in a low voice where my dear clara are your brother and sister i made no answer but pointed to the bed his attendants drew aside the curtain and while their eyes glared with horror at the spectacle which they beheld those of mr hallet overflowed with tears  after considerable pause he once more turned to me my dear girl this sight is not for you can you confide in my care and that of mrs bayntons we will see performed all that circumstances require  i made strenuous opposition to this request i insisted on remaining near her till she were interred his remonstrances however and my own feelings showed me the propriety of a temporary dereliction louisa stood in need of a comforter and my brothers children of a nurse my unhappy brother was himself an object of solicitude and care at length i consented to relinquish the corpse and go to my brothers whose house i said would need mistress and his children a parent  during this discourse my venerable friend struggled with his tears but my last intimation called them forth with fresh violence meanwhile his attendants stood round in mournful silence gazing on me and at each other i repeated my resolution and rose to execute it but he took my hand to detain me his countenance betrayed irresolution and reluctance i requested him to state the reason of his opposition to this measure i entreated him to be explicit i told him that my his brother had just been there and that i knew his condition this misfortune had driven him to madness and his offspring must not want a protector if he chose i would resign wieland to his care but his innocent and helpless babes stood in instant need of nurse and mother and these offices i would by no means allow another to perform while i had life  every word that i uttered seemed to augment his perplexity and distress at last he said i think clara i have entitled myself to some regard from you you have professed your willingness to oblige me now i call upon you to confer upon me the highest obligation in your power permit mrs baynton to have the management of your brothers house for two or three days then it shall be yours to act in it as you please no matter what are my motives in making this request perhaps i think your age your sex or the distress which this disaster must occasion incapacitates you for the office surely you have no doubt of mrs bayntons tenderness or discretion  new ideas now rushed into my mind i fixed my eyes steadfastly on mr hallet are they well said i is louisa well are benjamin and william and constantine and little clara are they safe tell me truly i beseech you  they are well he replied they are perfectly safe  fear no effeminate weekness in me i can bear to hear the truth tell me truly are they well  he again assured me that they were well  what then resumed i do you fear is it possible for any calamity to disqualify me for performing my duty to these helpless innocents i am willing to divide the care of them with mrs baynton i shall be grateful for her sympathy and aid but what should i be to desert them at an hour like this  i will cut short this distressful dialogue i still persisted in my purpose and he still persisted in his opposition this excited my suspicions anew but these were removed by solemn declarations of their safety i could not explain this conduct in my friend but at length consented to go to the city provided i should see them for a few minutes at present and should return on the morrow  even this arrangement was objected to at length he told me they were removed to the city why were they removed i asked and whither my importunities would not now be eluded my suspicions were roused and no evasion or artifice was sufficient to allay them many of the audience began to give vent to their emotions in tears mr hallet himself seemed as if the conflict were too hard to be longer sustained something whispered to my heart that havoc had been wider than i now witnessed i suspected this concealment to arise from apprehensions of the effects which a knowledge of the truth would produce in me i since more entreated him to inform me truly of their state to enforce my entreaties i put on an air of insensibility i can guess said i what has happened  they are indeed beyond the reach of injury for they are dead is it not so my voice faltered in spite of my courageous efforts  yes said he they are dead dead by the same fate and by the same hand with their mother  dead replied i what all  all replied he he spared not one  allow me my friends to close my eyes upon he afterscene why should i protract a tale which  already begin to feel is too long over this scene  least let me pass lightly here indeed my narative would be imperfect all was tempestuous commotion in my heart and in my brain i have to memory for ought but unconscious transitions and rueful sights i was ingenious and indefatigae in the invention of torments i would not dispense with any spectacle adapted to exasperate my grief each pale and mangled form i crushed to my bosom louisa whom i loved with so ineffable  passion was denied to me at first but my obstiacy conquered their reluctance  they led the way into a darkened hall a lamp endant from the ceiling was uncovered and they ointed to a table the assassin had defrauded me f my last and miserable consolation i sought not not in her visage for the tinge of the morning and the luster of heaven these had vanished with life but i hoped for liberty to print a last kiss upon her lips this was denied me for such had been the merciless blow that destroyed her that not a lineament remained  i was carried hence to the city mrs hallet was my companion and my nurse why should i dwell upon the rage of fever and the effusions of delirium carwin was the phantom that pursued my dreams the giant oppressor under whose arm i was for ever on the point of being crushed strenuous muscles were required to hinder my flight and hearts of steel to withstand the eloquence of my fears in vain i called upon them to look upward to mark his sparkling rage and scowling contempt all i sought was to fly from the stroke that was lifted then i heaped upon my guards the most vehement reproaches or betook myself to wailings of the haplessness of my condition  this malady at length declined and my weeping friends began to look for my restoration slowly and with intermitted beams memory revisite me the scenes that i had witnessed were revived became the theme of deliberation and deduction and called forth the effusions of more rational sorrow  chapter xviii i had imperfectly recovered my strength when i was informed of the arrival of my mothers brother thomas cambridge ten years since he went to europe and was a surgeon in the british forces in germany during the whole of the late war after its conclusion some connection that he had formed with an irish officer made him retire into ireland intercourse had been punctually maintained by letters with his sisters children and hopes were given that he would shortly return to his native country and pass his old age in our society he was now in an evil hour arrived  i desired an interview with him for numerous and urgent reasons with the first returns of my understanding i had anxiously sought information of the fate of my brother during the course of my disease i had never seen him and vague and unsatisfactory answers were returned to all my inquiries i had vehemently interrogated mrs hallet and her husband and solicited an interview with this unfortunate man but they mysteriously insinuated that his reason was still unsettled and that his circumstances rendered an interview impossible their reserve on the particulars of this destruction and the author of it was equally invincible  for some time finding all my efforts fruitless i had desisted from direct inquiries and solicitations determined as soon as my strength was sufficiently renewed to pursue other means of dispelling my uncertainty in this state of things my uncles arrival and intention to visit me were announced i almost shuddered to behold the face of this man when i reflected on the disasters that had befallen us i was half unwilling to witness that dejection and grief which would be disclosed in his countenance but i believed that all transactions had been thoroughly disclosed to him and confided in my importunity to extort from him the knowledge that i sought  i had no doubt as to the person of our enemy but the motives that urged him to perpetrate these horrors the means that he used and his present condition were totally unknown it was reasonable to expect some information on this head from my uncle i therefore waited his coming with impatience at length in the dusk of the evening and in my solitary chamber this meeting took place  this man was our nearest relation and had ever treated us with the affection of a parent our meeting therefore could not be without overflowing tenderness and gloomy joy he rather encouraged than restrained the tears that i poured out in his arms and took upon himself the task of comforter allusions to recent disasters could not be long omitted one topic facilitated the admission of another at length i mentioned and deplored the ignorance in which i had been kept respecting my brothers destiny and the circumstances of our misfortunes i entreated him to tell me what was wielands condition and what progress had been made in detecting or punishing the author of this unheard of devastation  the author said he do you know the author  alas i answered i am too well acquainted with him the story of the grounds of my suspicions would be painful and too long i am not apprized of the extent of your present knowledge there are none but wieland pleyel and myself who are able to relate certain facts  spare yourself the pain said he all that wieland and pleyel can communicate i know already if any thing of moment has fallen within your own exclusive knowledge and the relation be not too arduous for your present strength i confess i am desirous of hearing it perhaps you allude to one by the name of carwin i will anticipate your curiosity by saying that since these disasters no one has seen or heard of him his agency is therefore a mystery still unsolved  i readily complied with his request and related as distinctly as i could though in general terms the events transacted in the summer house and my chamber he listened without apparent surprise to the tale of pleyels errors and suspicions and with augmented seriousness to my narrative of the warnings and inexplicable vision and the letter found upon the table i waited for his comments  you gather from this said he that carwin is the author of all this misery  is it not answered i an unavoidable inference but what know you respecting it was it possible to execute this mischief without witness or coadjutor i beseech you to relate to me when and why mr hallet was summoned to the scene and by whom this disaster was first suspected or discovered surely suspicion must have fallen upon some one and pursuit was made  my uncle rose from his seat and traversed the floor with hasty steps his eyes were fixed upon the ground and he seemed buried in perplexity at length he paused and said with an emphatic tone it is true the instrument is known carwin may have plotted but the execution was anothers that other is found and his deed is ascertained  good heaven i exclaimed what say you was not carwin the assassin could any hand but his have carried into act this dreadful purpose  have i not said returned he that the performance was anothers carwin perhaps or heaven or insanity prompted the murderer but carwin is unknown the actual performer has long since been called to judgment and convicted and is at this moment at the bottom of a dungeon loaded with chains  i lifted my hands and eyes who then is this assassin by what means and whither was he traced what is the testimony of his guilt  his own corroborated with that of a servantmaid who spied the murder of the children from a closet where she was concealed the magistrate returned from your dwelling to your brothers he was employed in hearing and recording the testimony of the only witness when the criminal himself unexpected unsolicited unsought entered the hall acknowledged his guilt and rendered himself up to justice  he has since been summoned to the bar the audience was composed of thousands whom rumors of this wonderful event had attracted from the greatest distance a long and impartial examination was made and the prisoner was called upon for his defense in compliance with this call he delivered an ample relation of his motives and actions there he stopped  i besought him to say who this criminal was and what the instigations that compelled him my uncle was silent i urged this inquiry with new force i reverted to my own knowledge and sought in this some basis to conjecture i ran over the scanty catalogue of the men whom i knew i lighted on no one who was qualified for ministering to malice like this again i resorted to importunity had i ever seen the criminal was it sheer cruelty or diabolical revenge that produced this overthrow  he surveyed me for a considerable time and listened to my interrogations in silence at length he spoke clara i have known thee by report and in some degree by observation thou art a being of no vulgar sort thy friends have hitherto treated thee as a child they meant well but perhaps they were unacquainted with thy strength i assure myself that nothing will surpass thy fortitude  thou art anxious to know the destroyer of thy family his actions and his motives shall i call him to thy presence and permit him to confess before thee shall i make him the narrator of his own tale  i started on my feet and looked round me with fearful glances as if the murderer was close at hand what do you mean said i put an end i beseech you to this suspense  be not alarmed you will never more behold the face of this criminal unless he be gifted with supernatural strength and sever like threads the constraint of links and bolts i have said that the assassin was arraigned at the bar and that the trial ended with a summons from the judge to confess or to vindicate his actions a reply was immediately made with significance of gesture and a tranquil majesty which denoted less of humanity than godhead judges advocates and auditors were panicstruck and breathless with attention one of the hearers faithfully recorded the speech there it is continued he putting a roll of papers in my hand you may read it at your leisure  with these words my uncle left me alone my curiosity refused me a moments delay i opened the papers and read as follows  chapter xix theodore wieland the prisoner at the bar was now called upon for his defense he looked around him for some time in silence and with a mild countenance at length he spoke  it is strange i am known to my judges and my auditors who is there present a stranger to the character of wieland who knows him not as an husband  as a father  as a friend yet here am i arraigned as criminal i am charged with diabolical malice i am accused of the murder of my wife and my children  it is true they were slain by me they all perished by my hand the task of vindication is ignoble what is it that i am called to vindicate and before whom  you know that they are dead and that they were killed by me what more would you have would you extort from me a statement of my motives have you failed to discover them already you charge me with malice but your eyes are not shut your reason is still vigorous your memory has not forsaken you you know whom it is that you thus charge the habits of his life are known to you his treatment of his wife and his offspring is known to you the soundness of his integrity and the unchangeableness of his principles are familiar to your apprehension yet you persist in this charge you lead me hither manacled as a felon you deem me worthy of a vile and tormenting death  who are they whom i have devoted to death my wife  the little ones that drew their being from me  that creature who as she surpassed them in excellence claimed a larger affection than those whom natural affinities bound to my heart think ye that malice could have urged me to this deed hide your audacious fronts from the scrutiny of heaven take refuge in some cavern unvisited by human eyes ye may deplore your wickedness or folly but ye cannot expiate it  think not that i speak for your sakes hug to your hearts this detestable infatuation deem me still a murderer and drag me to untimely death i make not an effort to dispel your illusion i utter not a word to cure you of your sanguinary folly but there are probably some in this assembly who have come from far for their sakes whose distance has disabled them from knowing me i will tell what i have done and why  it is needless to say that god is the object of my supreme passion i have cherished in his presence a single and upright heart i have thirsted for the knowledge of his will i have burnt with ardour to approve my faith and my obedience  my days have been spent in searching for the revelation of that will but my days have been mournful because my search failed i solicited direction i turned on every side where glimmerings of light could be discovered i have not been wholly uninformed but my knowledge has always stopped short of certainty dissatisfaction has insinuated itself into all my thoughts my purposes have been pure my wishes indefatigable but not till lately were these purposes thoroughly accomplished and these wishes fully gratified  i thank thee my father for thy bounty that thou did not ask a less sacrifice than this that thou placedst me in a condition to testify my submission to thy will what have i withheld which it was thy pleasure to exact now may i with dauntless and erect eye claim my reward since i have given thee the treasure of my soul  i was at my own house it was late in the evening my sister had gone to the city but proposed to return it was in expectation of her return that my wife and i delayed going to bed beyond the usual hour the rest of the family however were retired  my mind was contemplative and calm not wholly devoid of apprehension on account of my sisters safety recent events not easily explained had suggested the existence of some danger but this danger was without a distinct from in our imagination and scarcely ruffled our tranquillity  time passed and my sister did not arrive her house is at some distance from mine and though her arrangements had been made with a view to residing with us it was possible that through forgetfulness or the occurrence of unforeseen emergencies she had returned to her own dwelling  hence it was conceived proper that i should ascertain the truth by going thither i went on my way my mind was full of these ideas which related to my intellectual condition in the torrent of fervid conceptions i lost sight of my purpose some times i stood still some times i wandered from my path and experienced some difficulty on recovering from my fit of musing to regain it  the series of my thoughts is easily traced at first every vein beat with raptures known only to the man whose parental and conjugal love is without limits and the cup of whose desires immense as it is overflows with gratification i know not why emotions that were perpetual visitants should now have recurred with unusual energy the transition was not new from sensations of joy to a consciousness of gratitude the author of my being was likewise the dispenser of every gift with which that being was embellished the service to which a benefactor like this was entitled could not be circumscribed my social sentiments were indebted to their alliance with devotion for all their value all passions are base all joys feeble all energies malignant which are not drawn from this source  for a time my contemplations soared above earth and its inhabitants i stretched forth my hands i lifted my eyes and exclaimed o that i might be admitted to thy presence that mine were the supreme delight of knowing thy will and of performing it the blissful privilege of direct communication with thee and of listening to the audible enunciation of thy pleasure  what task would i not undertake what privation would i not cheerfully endure to testify my love of thee alas thou hidest thyself from my view glimpses only of thy excellence and beauty are afforded me would that a momentary emanation from thy glory would visit me that some unambiguous token of thy presence would salute my senses  in this mood i entered the house of my sister it was vacant scarcely had i regained recollection of the purpose that brought me hither thoughts of a different tendency had such absolute possession of my mind that the relations of time and space were almost obliterated from my understanding these wanderings however were restrained and i ascended to her chamber  i had no light and might have known by external observation that the house was without any inhabitant with this however i was not satisfied i entered the room and the object of my search not appearing i prepared to return  the darkness required some caution in descending the stair i stretched my hand to seize the balustrade by which i might regulate my steps how shall i describe the luster which at that moment burst upon my vision  i was dazzled my organs were bereaved of their activity my eyelids were halfclosed and my hands withdrawn from the balustrade a nameless fear chilled my veins and i stood motionless this irradiation did not retire or lessen it seemed as if some powerful effulgence covered me like a mantle  i opened my eyes and found all about me luminous and glowing it was the element of heaven that flowed around nothing but a fiery stream was at first visible but anon a shrill voice from behind called upon me to attend  i turned it is forbidden to describe what i saw words indeed would be wanting to the task the lineaments of that being whose veil was now lifted and whose visage beamed upon my sight no hues of pencil or of language can pourtray  as it spoke the accents thrilled to my heart thy prayers are heard in proof of thy faith render me thy wife this is the victim i choose call her hither and here let her fall  the sound and visage and light vanished at once  what demand was this the blood of catharine was to be shed my wife was to perish by my hand i sought opportunity to attest my virtue little did i expect that a proof like this would have been demanded  my wife i exclaimed o god substitute some other victim make me not the butcher of my wife my own blood is cheap this will i pour out before thee with a willing heart but spare i beseech thee this precious life or commission some other than her husband to perform the bloody deed  in vain the conditions were prescribed the decree had gone forth and nothing remained but to execute it i rushed out of the house and across the intermediate fields and stopped not till i entered my own parlour  my wife had remained here during my absence in anxious expectation of my return with some tidings of her sister i had none to communicate for a time i was breathless with my speed this and the tremors that shook my frame and the wildness of my looks alarmed her she immediately suspected some disaster to have happened to her friend and her own speech was as much overpowered by emotion as mine  she was silent but her looks manifested her impatience to hear what i had to communicate i spoke but with so much precipitation as scarcely to be understood catching her at the same time by the arm and forcibly pulling her from her seat  come along with me fly waste not a moment time will be lost and the deed will be omitted tarry not question not but fly with me  this deportment added afresh to her alarms her eyes pursued mine and she said what is the matter for gods sake what is the matter where would you have me go  my eyes were fixed upon her countenance while she spoke i thought upon her virtues i viewed her as the mother of my babes as my wife i recalled the purpose for which i thus urged her attendance my heart faltered and i saw that i must rouse to this work all my faculties the danger of the least delay was imminent  i looked away from her and again exerting my force drew her toward the door  you must go with me  indeed you must  in her fright she halfresisted my efforts and again exclaimed good heaven what is it you mean where go what has happened have you found clara  follow me and you will see i answered still urging her reluctant steps forward  what phrenzy has seized you something must needs have happened is she sick have you found her  come and see follow me and know for yourself  still she expostulated and besought me to explain this mysterious behavior i could not trust myself to answer her to look at her but grasping her arm i drew her after me she hesitated rather through confusion of mind than from unwillingness to accompany me this confusion gradually abated and she moved forward but with irresolute footsteps and continual exclamations of wonder and terror her interrogations of what was the matter and whither was i going were ceaseless and vehement  it was the scope of my efforts not to think to keep up a conflict and uproar in my mind in which all order and distinctness should be lost to escape from the sensations produced by her voice i was therefore silent i strove to abridge this interval by my haste and to waste all my attention in furious gesticulations  in this state of mind we reached my sisters door she looked at the windows and saw that all was desolate  why come we here there is no body here i will not go in  still i was dumb but opening the door i drew her into the entry this was the allotted scene here she was to fall i let go her hand and pressing my palms against my forehead made one mighty effort to work up my soul to the deed  in vain it would not be my courage was appalled my arms nerveless i muttered prayers that my strength might be aided from above they availed nothing  horror diffused itself over me this conviction of my cowardice my rebellion fastened upon me and i stood rigid and cold as marble from this state i was somewhat relieved by my wifes voice who renewed her supplications to be told why we came hither and what was the fate of my sister  what could i answer my words were broken and inarticulate her fears naturally acquired force from the observation of these symptoms bu these fears were misplaced the only inference she deduced from my conduct was that some terrible mishap had befallen clara  she wrung her hands and exclaimed in a agony o tell me where is she what has become of her is she sick dead is she in he chamber o let me go thither and know the worst  this proposal set my thoughts one more in motion perhaps what my rebellious heart refused to perform here i might obtain strength enough to execute elsewhere  come then said i let us go  i will but not in the dark we must first procure a light  fly then and procure it but i charge you linger not i will await for your return  while she was gone i strode along the entry the sellness of a gloomy hurricane but faintly resembled the discord that reigned in my mind to omit this sacrifice must not be yet my sinews had refused to perform it no alternative was offered to rebel against the mandate was impossible but obedience would render me the executioner of my wife my will was strong but my limbs refused their office  she returned with a light i led the way to the chamber she looked round her she lifted the curtain of the bed she saw nothing  at length she fixed inquiring eyes upon me the light now enabled her to discover in my visage what darkness had hitherto concealed her cares were now transferred from my sister to myself and she said in a tremulous voice wieland you are not well what ails you can i do nothing for you  that accents and looks so winning should sarm me of my resolution was to be expected my thoughts were thrown anew into anarchy i spread my hand before my eyes that i might not see her and answered only by groans she took my other hand between here is and pressing it to her heart spoke with that voice which had ever swayed y will and wasted away sorrow  my friend my souls friend tell me thy cause of grief do i not merit to partake with thee in thy cares am i not thy wife  this was too much i broke from her embrace and retired to a corner of the room in this pause courage was once more infused into me i resolved to execute my duty she followed me and renewed her passionate entreaties to know the cause of my distress  i raised my head and regarded her with steadfast looks i muttered something about death and the injunctions of my duty at these words she shrunk back and looked at me with a new expression of anguish after a pause she clasped her hands and exclaimed   o wieland wieland god grant that i am mistaken but surely something is wrong i see it it is too plain thou art undone  lost to me and to thyself at the same time she gazed on my features with intensest anxiety in hope that different symptoms would take place i replied to her with vehemence   undone no my duty is known and i thank my god that my cowardice is now vanquished and i have power to fulfill it catharine i pity the weakness of thy nature i pity thee but must not spare thy life is claimed from my hands thou must die  fear was now added to her grief what mean you why talk you of death bethink yourself wieland bethink yourself and this fit will pass o why came i hither why did you drag me hither  i brought thee hither to fulfill a divine command i am appointed thy destroyer and destroy thee i must saying this i seized her wrists she shrieked aloud and endeavored to free herself from my grasp but her efforts were vain  surely surely wieland thou do not mean it am i not thy wife and would thou kill me thou will not and yet  i see  thou art wieland no longer a fury resistless and horrible possesses thee  spare me  spare  help  help    till her breath was stopped she shrieked for help  for mercy when she could speak no longer er gestures her looks appealed to my compassion my accursed hand was irresolute and tremulous i meant thy death to be sudden thy struggles to be brief alas my heart was infirm my resolves mutable thrice i slackened my grasp and life kept its hold though in the midst of pangs her eye balls started from their sockets grimness and distortion took place of all that used to bewitch me into transport and subdue me into reverence  i was commissioned to kill thee but not to torment thee with the foresight of thy death not to multiply thy fears and prolong thy agonies haggard and pale and lifeless at length thou ceasedst to contend with thy destiny  this was a moment of triumph thus had i successfully subdued the stubbornness of human passions the victim which had been demanded was given the deed was done past recall  i lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed i gazed upon it with delight such was the elation of my thoughts that i even broke into laughter i clapped my hands and exclaimed it is done my sacred duty is fulfilled to that i have sacrificed o my god thy last and best gift my wife  for a while i thus soared above frailty i imagined i had set myself forever beyond the reach of selfishness but my imaginations were false this rapture quickly subsided i looked again at my wife my joyous ebullitions vanished and i asked myself who it was whom i saw methought it could not be catharine it could not be the woman who had lodged for years in my heart who had slept nightly in my bosom who had borne in her womb who had fostered at her breast the beings who called me father whom i had watched with delight and cherished with a fondness ever new and perpetually growing it could not be the same  where was her bloom these deadly and bloodsuffused orbs but ill resemble the azure and exstatic tenderness of her eyes the lucid stream that meandered over that bosom the glow of love that was wont to sit upon that cheek are much unlike these livid stains and this hideous deformity alas these were the traces of agony the gripe of the assassin had been here  i will not dwell upon my lapse into desperate and outrageous sorrow the breath of heaven that sustained me was withdrawn and i sunk into mere man i leaped from the floor i dashed my head against the wall i uttered screams of horror i panted after torment and pain eternal fire and the bickerings of hell compared with what i felt were music and a bed of roses  i thank my god that this degeneracy was transient that he deigned once more to raise me aloft i thought upon what i had done as a sacrifice to duty and was calm my wife was dead but i reflected that though this source of human consolation was closed yet others were still open it the transports of an husband were no more the feelings of a father had still scope for exercise when remembrance of their mother should excite too keen a pang i would look upon them and be comforted  while i revolved these ideas new warmth flowed in upon my heart  i was wrong these feelings were the growth of selfishness of this i was not aware and to dispel the mist that obscured my perceptions a new effulgence and a new mandate were necessary  from these thoughts i was recalled by a ray that was shot into the room a voice spoke like that which i had before heard  thou have done well but all is not done  the sacrifice is incomplete  thy children must be offered  they must perish with their mother    chapter xx will you wonder that i read no farther will you not rather he astonished that i read thus far what power supported me through such a task i know not perhaps the doubt from which i could not disengage my mind that the scene here depicted was a dream contributed to my perseverance in vain the solemn introduction of my uncle his appeals to my fortitude and allusions to something monstrous in the events he was about to disclose in vain the distressful perplexity the mysterious silence and ambiguous answers of my attendants especially when the condition of my brother was the theme of my inquiries were remembered i recalled the interview with wieland in my chamber his preternatural tranquillity succeeded by bursts of passion and menacing actions all these coincided with the tenor of this paper  catharine and her children and louisa were dead the act that destroyed them was in the highest degree inhuman it was worthy of savages trained to murder and exulting in agonies  who was the performer of the deed wieland my brother the husband and the father that man of gentle virtues and invincible benignty placable and mild  an idolator of peace surely said i it is a dream for many days have i been vexed with frenzy its dominion is still felt but new forms are called up to diversify and augment my torments  the paper dropped from my hand and my eyes followed it i shrunk back as if to avoid some petrifying influence that approached me my tongue was mute all the functions of nature were at a stand and i sunk upon the floor lifeless  the noise of my fall as i afterward heard alarmed my uncle who was in a lower apartment and whose apprehensions had detained him he hastened to my chamber and administered the assistance which my condition required when i opened my eyes i beheld him before me his skill as a reasoner as well as a physician was exerted to obviate the injurious effects of this disclosure but he had wrongly estimated the strength of my body or of my mind this new shock brought me once more to the brink of the grave and my malady was much more difficult to subdue than at first  i will not dwell upon the long train of dreary sensations and the hdeous confusion of my understanding time slowly restored its customary firmness to my frame and order to my thoughts the images impressed upon my mind by this fatal paper were somewhat effaced by my malady they were obscure and disjointed like the parts of a dream i was desirous of freeing my imagination from this chaos for this end i questioned my uncle who was my constant companion he was intimidated by the issue of his first experiment and took pains to elude or discourage my inquiry my impetuosity some times compelled him to have resort to misrepresentations and untruths  time effected that end perhaps in a more beneficial manner in the course of my meditations the recollections of the past gradually became more distinct i revolved them however in silence and being no longer accompanied with surprise they did not exercise a deathdealing power i had discontinued the perusal of the paper in the midst of the narrative but what i read combined with information elsewhere obtained threw perhaps a sufficient light upon these detestable transactions yet my curiosity was not inactive i desired to peruse the remainder  my eagerness to know the particulars of this tale was mingled and abated by my antipathy to the scene which would be disclosed hence i employed no means to effect my purpose i desired knowledge and at the same time shrunk back from receiving the boon  one morning being left alone i rose from my bed and went to a drawer where my finer clothing used to be kept i opened it and this fatal paper saluted my sight i snatched it involuntarily and withdrew to a chair i debated for a few minutes whether i should open and read now that my fortitude was put to trial it failed i felt myself incapable of deliberately surveying a scene of so much horror i was prompted to return it to its place but this resolution gave way and i determined to peruse some part of it i turned over the leaves till i came near the conclusion the narrative of the criminal was finished the verdict of guilty reluctantly pronounced by the jury and the accused interrogated why sentence of death should not pass the answer was brief solemn and emphatical  no i have nothing to say my tale has been told my motives have been truly stated if my judges are unable to discern the purity of my intentions or to credit the statement of them which i have just made if they see not that my deed was enjoined by heaven that obedience was the test of perfect virtue and the extinction of selfishness and error they must pronounce me a murderer  they refuse to credit my tale they impute my acts to the influence of demons they account me an example of the highest wickedness of which human nature is capable they doom me to death and infamy have i power to escape this evil if i have be sure i will exert it i will not accept evil at their hand when i am entitled to good i will suffer only when i cannot elude suffering  you say that i am guilty impious and rash thus to usurp the prerogatives of your maker to set up your bounded views and halting reason as the measure of truth  thou omnipotent and holy thou know that my actions were conformable to thy will i know not what is crime what actions are evil in their ultimate and comprehensive tendency or what are good thy knowledge as thy power is unlimited i have taken thee for my guide and cannot err to the arms of thy protection i entrust my safety in the awards of thy justice i confide for my recompense  come death when it will i am safe let calumny and abhorrence pursue me among men i shall not be defrauded of my dues the peace of virtue and the glory of obedience will be my portion hereafter  here ended the speaker i withdrew my eyes from the page but before i had time to reflect on what i had read mr cambridge entered the room he quickly perceived how i had been employed and betrayed some solicitude respecting the condition of my mind  his fears however were superfluous what i had read threw me into a state not easily described anguish and fury however had no part in it my faculties were chained up in wonder and awe just then i was unable to speak i looked at my friend with an air of inquisitiveness and pointed at the roll he comprehended my inquiry and answered me with looks of gloomy acquiescence after some time my thoughts found their way to my lips  such then were the acts of my brother such were his words for this he was condemned to die to die upon the gallows a fate cruel and unmerited and is it so continued i struggling for utterance which this new idea made difficult is he  dead  no he is alive there could be no doub as to the cause of these excesses they originated in sudden madness but that madness continues and he is condemned to perpetual imprisonment  madness say you are you sure were not these sights and these sounds really seen and heard  my uncle was surprised at my question he looked at me with apparent inquietude can you doubt said he that these were illusions does heaven think you interfere for such ends  o no i think it not heaven cannot stimulate to such unheard of outrage the agent was not good but evil  nay my dear girl said my friend lay aside these fancies neither angel nor devil had any part in this affair  you misunderstand me i answered i believe the agency to be external and real but not supernatural  indeed said he in an accent of surprise whom do you then suppose to be the agent  i know not all is wildering conjecture i cannot forget carwin i cannot banish the suspicion that he was the setter of these snares but how can we suppose it to be madness did insanity ever before assume this form  frequently the illusion in this case was more dreadful in its consequences than any that has come to my knowledge but i repeat that similar illusions are not rare did you never hear of an instance which occurred in your mothers family  no i beseech you relate it my grandfathers death i have understood to have been extraordinary but i know not in what respect a brother to whom he was much attached died in his youth and this as i have heard influenced in some remarkable way the fate of my grandfather but i am unacquainted with particulars  on the death of that brother resumed my friend my father was seized with dejection which was found to flow from two sources he not only grieved for the loss of a friend but entertained the belief that his own death would be inevitably consequent on that of his brother he waited from day to day in expectation of the stroke which he predicted was speedily to fall upon him gradually however he recovered his cheerfulness and confidence he married and performed his part in the world with spirit and activity at the end of twentyone years it happened that he spent the summer with his family at an house which he possessed on the sea coast in cornwall it was at no great distance from a cliff which overhung the ocean and rose into the air to a great height the summit was level and secure and easily ascended on the land side the company frequently repaired hither in clear weather invited by its pure airs and extensive prospects one evening in june my father with his wife and some friends chanced to be on this spot every one was happy and my fathers imagination seemed particularly alive to the grandeur of the scenery  suddenly however his limbs trembled and his features betrayed alarm he threw himself into the attitude of one listening he gazed earnestly in a direction in which nothing was visible to his friends this lasted for a minute then turning to his companions he told them that his brother had just delivered to him a summons which must be instantly obeyed he then took an hasty and solemn leave of each person and before their surprise would allow them to understand the scene he rushed to the edge of the cliff threw himself headlong and was seen no more  in the course of my practice in the german army many cases equally remarkable have occurred unquestionably the illusions were maniacal though the vulgar thought otherwise they are all reducible to one class mania mutabilis see darwins zoonomia vol ii class iii     where similar cases are stated and are not more difficult of explication and cure than most affections of our frame  this opinion my uncle endeavored by various means to impress upon me i listened to his reasonings and illustrations with silent respect my astonishment was great on finding proofs of an influence of which i had supposed there were no examples but i was far from accounting for appearances in my uncles manner ideas thronged into my mind which i was unable to disjoin or to regulate i reflected that this madness if madness it were had affected pleyel and myself as well as wieland pleyel had heard a mysterious voice i had seen and heard a form had showed itself to me as well as to wieland the disclosure had been made in the same spot the appearance was equally complete and equally prodigious in both instances whatever supposition i should adopt had i not equal reason to tremble what was my security against influences equally terrific and equally irresistible  it would be vain to attempt to describe the state of mind which this idea produced i wondered at the change which a moment had affected in my brothers condition now was i stupefied with tenfold wonder in contemplating myself was i not likewise transformed from rational and human into a creature of nameless and fearful attributes was i not transported to the brink of the same abyss ere a new day should come my hands might be embrued in blood and my remaining life be consigned to a dungeon and chains  with moral sensibility like mine no wonder that this new dread was more insupportable than the anguish i had lately endured grief carries its own antidote along with it when thought becomes merely a vehicle of pain its progress must be stopped death is a cure which nature or ourselves must administer to this cure i now looked forward with gloomy satisfaction  my silence could not conceal from my uncle the state of my thoughts he made unwearied efforts to divert my attention from views so pregnant with danger his efforts aided by time were in some measure successful confidence in the strength of my resolution and in the healthful state of my faculties was once more revived i was able to devote my thoughts to my brothers state and the causes of this disasterous proceeding  my opinions were the sport of eternal change some times i conceived the apparition to be more than human i had no grounds on which to build a disbelief i could not deny faith to the evidence of my religion the testimony of men was loud and unanimous both these concurred to persuade me that evil spirits existed and that their energy was frequently exerted in the system of the world  these ideas connected themselves with the image of carwin where is the proof said i that demons may not be subjected to the control of men this truth may be distorted and debased in the minds of the ignorant the dogmas of the vulgar with regard to this subject are glaringly absurd but though these may justly be neglected by the wise we are scarcely justified in totally rejecting the possibility that men may obtain supernatural aid  the dreams of superstition are worthy of contempt witchcraft its instruments and miracles the compact ratified by a bloody signature the apparatus of sulpherous smells and thundering explosions are monstrous and chimerical these have no part in the scene over which the genius of carwin presides that conscious beings dissimilar from human but moral and voluntary agents as we are some where exist can scarcely be denied that their aid may be employed to benign or malignant purposes cannot be disproved  darkness rests upon the designs of this man the extent of his power is unknown but is their not evidence that it has been now exerted  i recurred to my own experience here carwin had actually appeared upon the stage but this was in a human character a voice and a form were discovered but one was apparently exerted and the other disclosed not to befriend but to counteract carwins designs there were tokens of hostility and not of alliance between them carwin was the miscreant whose projects were resisted by a minister of heaven how can this be reconciled to the stratagem which ruined my brother there the agency was at once preternatural and malignant  the recollection of this fact led my thoughts into a new channel the malignity of that influence which governed my brother had hitherto been no subject of doubt his wife and children were destroyed they had expired in agony and fear yet was it indisputably certain that their murderer was criminal he was acquitted at the tribunal of his own conscience his behavior at his trial and since was faithfully reported to me appearances were uniform not for a moment did he lay aside the majesty of virtue he repelled all invectives by appealing to the deity and to the tenor of his past life surely there was truth in this appeal none but a command from heaven could have swayed his will and nothing but unerring proof of divine approbation could sustain his mind in its present elevation  chapter xxi such for some time was the course of my meditations my weakness and my aversion to be pointed at as an object of surprise or compassion prevented me from going into public i studiously avoided the visits of those who came to express the sympathy or gratify their curiosity my uncle was my principal companion nothing more powerfully tended to console me than his conversation  with regard to pleyel my feelings seemed to have undergone a total revolution it often happens that one passion supplants another late disasters had rent my heart and now that the wound was in some degree closed the love which i had cherished for this man seemed likewise to have vanished  hitherto indeed i had had no cause for despair i was innocent of that offense which had estranged him from my presence i might reasonably expect that my innocence would at some time be irresistably demonstrated and his affection for me be revived with his esteem now my aversion to be though culpable by him continued but was unattended with the same impatience i desired the removal of his suspicions not for the sake of regaining his love but because i delighted in the veneration of so excellent a man and because he himself would derive pleasure from conviction of my integrity  my uncle had early informed me that pleyel and he had seen each other since the return of the latter from europe amidst the topics of their conversation i discovered that pleyel had carefully omitted the mention of those events which had drawn upon me so much abhorrence i could not account for his silence on this subject perhaps time or some new discovery had altered or shaken his opinion perhaps he was unwilling though i were guilty to injure me in the opinion of my venerable kinsman i understood that he had frequently visited me during my disease had watched many successive nights by my beside and manifested the utmost anxiety on my account  the journey which he was preparing to take at the termination of our last interview the catastrophe of the ensuing night induced him to delay the motives of this journey i had till now totally mistaken they were explained to me by my uncle whose tale excited my astonishment without awakening my regret in a different state of mind it would have added unspeakably to my distress but now it was more a source of pleasure than pain this perhaps is not the least extraordinary of the facts contained in this narrative it will excite less wonder when i add that my indifference was temporary and that the lapse of a few days showed me that my feelings were deadened for a time rather than finally extinguished  theresa de stolberg was alive she had conceived the resolution of seeking her lover in america to conceal her flight she had caused the report of her death to be propagated she put herself under the conduct of bertrand the faithful servant of pleyel the packet which the latter received from the hands of his servant contained the tidings of her safe arrival at boston and to meet her there was the purpose of his journey  this discovery had set this mans character in a new light i had mistaken the heroism of friendship for the phrenzy of love he who had gained my affections may be supposed to have previously entitled himself to my reverence but the levity which had formerly characterized the behavior of this man tended to obscure the greatness of his sentiments i did not fail to remark that since this lady was still alive the voice in the temple which asserted her death must either have been intended to deceive or have been itself deceived the latter supposition was inconsistent with the notion of a spiritual and the former with that of a benevolent being  when my disease abated pleyel had forborne his visits and had lately set out upon this journey this amounted to a proof that my guilt was still believed by him i was grieved for his errors but trusted that my vindication would sooner or later be made  meanwhile tumultuous thoughts were again set afloat by a proposal made to me by my uncle he imagined that new airs would restore my languishing constitution and a varied succession of objects tend to repair the shock which my mind had received for this end he proposed to me to take up my abode with him in france or italy  at a more prosperous period this scheme would have pleased for its own sake now my heart sickened at the prospect of nature the world of man was shrouded in misery and blood and constituted a loathsome spectacle i willingly closed my eyes in sleep and regretted that the respite it afforded me was so short i marked with satisfaction the progress of decay in my frame and consented to live merely in the hope that the course of nature would speedily relieve me from the burden nevertheless as he persisted in his scheme i concurred in it merely because he was entitled to my gratitude and because my refusal gave him pain  no sooner was he informed of my consent than he told me i must make immediate preparation to embark as the ship in which he had engaged a passage would be ready to depart in three days this expedition was unexpected there was an impatience in his manner when he urged the necessity of dispatch that excited my surprise when i questioned him as to the cause of this haste he generally stated reasons which at that time i could not deny to be plausible but which on the review appeared insufficient i suspected that the true motives were concealed and believed that these motives had some connection with my brothers destiny  i now recollected that the information respecting wieland which had from time to time been imparted to me was always accompanied with airs of reserve and mysteriousness what had appeared sufficiently explicit at the time it was uttered i now remembered to have been faltering and ambiguous i was resolved to remove my doubts by visiting the unfortunate man in his dungeon  heretofore the idea of this visit had occurred to me but the horrors of his dewlling place his wild yet placid physiognomy his neglected locks the letters which constrained his limbs terrible as they were in description how could i endure to behold  now however that i was preparing to take an everlasting farewell of my country now that an ocean was henceforth to separate me from him how could i part without an interview i would examine his situation with my own eyes i would know whether the representations which had been made to me were true perhaps the sight of the sister whom he was wont to love with a passion more than fraternal might have an auspicious influence on his malady  having formed this resolution i waited to communicate it to mr cambridge i was aware that without his concurrence i could not hope to carry it into execution and could discover no objection to which it was liable if i had not been deceived as to his condition no inconvenience could arise from this proceeding his consent therefore would be the test of his sincerity  i seized this opportunity to state my wishes on this head my suspicions were confirmed by the manner in which my request affected him after some pause in which his countenance betrayed every mark of perplexity he said to me why would you pay this visit what useful purpose can it serve  we are preparing said i to leave the country forever what kind of being should i be to leave behind me a brother in calamity without even a parting interview indulge me for three minutes in the sight of him my heart will be much easier after i have looked at him and shed a few tears in his presence  i believe otherwise the sight of him would only augment your distress without contributing in any degree to his benefit  i know not that returned i surely the sympathy of his sister proofs that her tenderness is as lively as ever must be a source of satisfaction to him at present he must regard all mankind as his enemies and calumniators his sister he probably conceives to partake in the general infatuation and to join in the cry of abhorrence that is raised against him to be undeceived in this respect to be assured that however i may impute his conduct to delusion i still retain all my former affection for his person and veneration for the purity of his motives cannot but afford him pleasure when he hears that i have left the country without even the ceremonious attention of a visit what will he think of me his magnanimity may hinder him from repining but he will surely consider my behavior as savage and unfeeling indeed dear sir i must pay this visit to embark with you without paying it will be impossible it may be no service to him but will enable me to acquit myself of what i cannot but esteem a duty besides continued i if it be a mere fit of insanity that has seized him may not my presence chance to have a salutary influence the mere sight of me it is not impossible may rectify his perceptions  ay said my uncle with some eagerness it is by no means impossible that your interview may have that effect and for that reason beyond all others would i dissuade you from it  i expressed my surprise at this declaration is it not to be desired that an error so fatal as this should be rectified  i wonder at your question reflect on the consequences of this error has he not destroyed the wife whom he loved the children whom he idolized what is it that enables him to bear the remembrance but the belief that he acted as his duty enjoined would you rashly bereave him of this belief would you restore him to himself and convince him that he was instigated to this dreadful outrage by a perversion of his organs or a delusion from hell  now his visions are joyous and elate he conceives himself to have reached a loftier degree of virtue than any other human being the merit of his sacrifice is only enhanced in the eyes of superior beings by the detestation that pursues him here and the sufferings to which he is condemned the belief that even his sister has deserted him and goes over to his enemies adds to his sublimity of feelings and his confidence in divine approbation and future recompense  let him be undeceived in this respect and what floods of despair and of horror will overwhelm him instead of glowing approbation and serene hope will he not hate and torture himself selfviolence or a phrenzy far more savage and destructive than this may be expected to succeed i beseech you therefore to relinquish this scheme if you calmly reflect upon it you will discover that your duty lies in carefully shunning him  mr cambridges reasonings suggested views to my understanding that had not hitherto occurred i could not but admit their validity but they showed in a new light the depth of that misfortune in which my brother was plunged i was silent and irresolute  presently i considered that whether wieland was a maniac a faithful servant of his god the victim of hellish illusions or the dupe of human imposture was by no means certain in this state of my mind it became me to be silent during the visit that i projected this visit should be brief i should be satisfied merely to snatch a look at him admitting that a change in his opinions were not to be desired there was no danger from the conduct which i should pursue that this change should be wrought  but i could not conquer my uncles aversion to this scheme yet i persisted and he found that to make me voluntarily relinquish it it was necessary to be more explicit than he had hitherto been he took both my hands and anxiously examining my countenance as he spoke clara said he this visit must not be paid we must hasten with the utmost expedition from this shore it is folly to conceal the truth from you and since it is only by disclosing the truth that you can be prevailed upon to lay aside this project the truth shall be told  o my dear girl continued he with increasing energy in his accent your brothers phrenzy is indeed stupendous and frightful the soul that formerly actuated his frame has disappeared the same form remains but the wise and benevolent wieland is no more a fury that is rapacious of blood that lifts his strength almost above that of mortals that bends all his energies to the destruction of whatever was once dear to him possesses him wholly  you must not enter his dungeon his eyes will no sooner be fixed upon you than an exertion of his force will be made he will shake off his fetters in a moment and rush upon you no interposition will then be strong or quick enough to save you  the phantom that has urged him to the murder of catharine and her children is not yet appeased your life and that of pleyel are exacted from him by this imaginary being he is eager to comply with this demand twice he has escaped from his prison the first time he no sooner found himself at liberty than he hasted to pleyels house it being midnight the latter was in bed wieland penetrated unobserved to his chamber and opened his curtain happily pleyel awoke at the critical moment and escaped the fury of his kinsman by leaping from his chamberwindow into the court happily he reached the ground without injury alarms were given and after diligent search your brother was found in a chamber of your house whither no doubt he had sought you  his chains and the watchfulness of his guards were redoubled but again by some miracle he restored himself to liberty he was now incautiously apprized of the place of your abode and had not information of his escape been instantly given your death would have been added to the number of his atrocious acts  you now see the danger of your project you must not only forbear to visit him but if you would save him from the crime of embruing his hands in your blood you must leave the country there is no hope that his malady will end but with his life and no precaution will ensure your safety but that of placing the ocean between you  i confess i came over with an intention to reside among you but these disasters have changed my views your own safety and my happiness require that you should accompany me in my return and i entreat you to give your cheerful concurrence to this measure  after these representations from my uncle it was impossible to retain my purpose i readily consented to seclude myself from wielands presence i likewise acquiesced in the proposal to go to europe not that i ever expected to arrive there but because since my principles forbad me to assail my own life change had some tendency to make supportable the few days which disease should spare to me  what a tale had thus been unfolded i was hunted to death not by one whom my misconduct had exasperated who was conscious of illicit motives and who sought his end by circumvention and surprise but by one who deemed himself commissioned for this act by heaven who regarded this career of horror as the last refinement of virtue whose implacability was proportioned to the reverence and love which he felt for me and who was inaccessible to the fear of punishment and ignominy  in vain should i endeavor to stay his hand by urging the claims of a sister or friend these were his only reasons for pursuing my destruction had i been a stranger to his blood had i been the most worthless of human kind my safety had not been endangered  surely said i my fate is without example the phrenzy which is charged upon my brother must belong to myself my foe is manacled and guarded but i derive no security from these restraints i live not in a community of savages yet whether i sit or walk go into crowds or hide myself in solitude my life is marked for a prey to inhuman violence i am in perpetual danger of perishing of perishing under the grasp of a brother  i recollected the omens of this destiny i remembered the gulf to which my brothers invitation had conducted me i remembered that when on the brink of danger the author of my peril was depicted by my fears in his form thus realized were the creatures of prophetic sleep and of wakeful terror  these images were unavoidably connected with that of carwin in this paroxysm of distress my attention fastened on him as the grand deceiver the author of this black conspiracy the intelligence that governed in this storm  some relief is afforded in the midst of suffering when its author is discovered or imagined and an object found on which we may pour out our indignation and our vengeance i ran over the events that had taken place since the origin of our intercourse with him and reflected on the tenor of that description which was received from ludloe mixed up with notions of supernatural agency were the vehement suspicions which i entertained that carwin was the enemy whose machinations had destroyed us  i thirsted for knowledge and for vengeance i regarded my hasty departure with reluctance since it would remove me from the means by which this knowledge might be obtained and this vengeance gratified this departure was to take place in two days at the end of two days i was to bid an eternal adieu to my native country should i not pay a parting visit to the scene of these disasters should i not bedew with my tears the graves of my sister and her children should i not explore their desolate habitation and gather from the sight of its walls and furniture food for my eternal melancholy  this suggestion was succeeded by a secret shuddering some disastrous influence appeared to overhang the scene how many memorials should i meet with serving to recall the images of those i had lost  i was tempted to relinquish my design when it occurred to me that i had left among my papers a journal of transactions in shorthand i was employed in this manuscript on that night when pleyels incautious curiosity tempted him to look over my shoulder i was then recording my adventure in the recess an imperfect sight of which led him into such fatal errors  i had regulated the disposition of all my property this manuscript however which contained the most secret transactions of my life i was desirous of destroying for this end i must return to my house and this i immediately determined to do  i was not willing to expose myself to opposition from my friends by mentioning my design i therefore bespoke the use of mr hallets chaise under pretense of enjoying an airing as the day was remarkably bright  this request was gladly complied with and i directed the servant to conduct me to mettingen i dismissed him at the gate intending to use in returning a carriage belonging to my brother  chapter xxii the inhabitants of the hut received me with a mixture of joy and surprise their homely welcome and their artless sympathy were grateful to my feelings in the midst of their inquiries as to my health they avoided all allusions to the source of my malady they were honest creatures and i loved them well i participated in the tears which they shed when i mentioned to them my speedy departure for europe and promised to acquaint them with my welfare during my long absence  they expressed great surprise when i informed them of my intention to visit my cottage alarm and foreboding overspread their features and they attempted to dissuade me from visiting an house which they firmly believed to be haunted by a thousand ghastly apparitions  those apprehensions however had no power over my conduct i took an irregular path which led me to my own house all was vacant and forlorn a small enclosure near which the path led was the buryingground belonging to the family this i was obliged to pass once i had intended to enter it and ponder on the emblems and inscriptions which my uncle had caused to be made on the tombs of catharine and her children but now my heart faltered as i approached and i hastened forward that distance might conceal it from my view  when i approached the recess my heart again sunk i averted my eyes and left it behind me as quickly as possible silence reigned through my habitation and a darkness which closed doors and shutters produced every object was connected with mine or my brothers history i passed the entry mounted the stair and unlocked the door of my chamber it was with difficulty that i curbed my fancy and smothered my fears slight movements and casual sounds were transformed into beckoning shadows and calling shapes  i proceeded to the closet i opened and looked round it with fearfulness all things were in their accustomed order i sought and found the manuscript where i was used to deposit it this being secured there was nothing to detain me yet i stood and contemplated awhile the furniture and walls of my chamber i remembered how long this apartment had been a sweet and tranquil asylum i compared its former state with its present dreariness and reflected that i now beheld it for the last time  here it was that the incomprehensible behavior of carwin was witnessed this the stage on which that enemy of man showed himself for a moment unmasked here the menaces of murder were wafted to my ear and here these menaces were executed  these thoughts had a tendency to take from me my selfcommand my feeble limbs refused to support me and i sunk upon a chair incoherent and halfarticulate exclamations escaped my lips the name of carwin was uttered and eternal woes woes like that which his malice had entailed upon us were heaped upon him i invoked allseeing heaven to drag to light and to punish this betrayer and accused its providence for having thus long delayed the retribution that was due to so enormous a guilt  i have said that the window shutters were closed a feeble light however found entrance through the orevices a small window illuminated the closet and the door being closed a dim ray streamed through the keyhole a kind of twilight was thus created sufficient for the purposes of vision but at the same time involving all minuter objects in obscurity  this darkness suited the color of my thoughts i sickened at the remembrance of the past the prospect of the future excited my loathing i muttered in a low voice why should i live longer why should i drag a miserable being all for whom i ought to live have perished am i not myself hunted to death  at that moment my despair suddenly became vigorous my nerves were no longer unstrung my powers that had long been deadened were revived my bosom swelled with a sudden energy and the conviction darted through my mind that to end my torments was at once practicable and wise  i knew how to find way to the recesses of life i could use a lancet with some skill and could distinguish between vein and artery by piercing deep into the latter i should shun the evils which the future had in store for me and take refuge from my woes in quiet death  i started on my feet for my feebleness was gone and hasted to the closet a lancet and other small instruments were preserved in a case which i had deposited here inattentive as i was to foreign considerations my ears were still open to any sound of mysterious import that should occur i thought i heard a step in the entry my purpose was suspended and i cast an eager glance at my chamber door which was open no one appeared unless the shadow which i discerned upon the floor was the outline of a man if it were i was authorized to suspect that some one was posted close to the entrance who possibly had overheard my exclamations  my teeth chattered and a wild confusion took place of my momentary calm thus it was when a terrify visage had disclosed itself on a former night thus it was when the evil destiny of wieland assumed the lineaments of something human what horrid apparition was preparing to blast my sight  still i listened and gazed not long for the shadow moved a foot unshapely and huge was thrust forward a form advanced from its concealment and stalked into the room it was carwin  while i had breath i shrieked while i had power over my muscles i motioned with my hand that he should vanish my exertions could not last long i sunk into a fit  o that this grateful oblivion had lasted for ever too quickly i recovered my senses the power of distinct vision was no sooner restored to me than this hateful form again presented itself and i once more relapsed  a second time untoward nature recalled me from the sleep of death i found myself stretched upon the bed when i had power to look up i remembered only that i had cause to fear my distempered fancy fashioned to itfelf no distinguishable image i threw a languid glance round me once more my eyes lighted upon carwin  he was seated on the floor his back rested against the wall his knees were drawn up and his face was buried in his hands that his station was at some distance that his attitude was not menacing that his ominous visage was concealed may account for my now escaping a shock violent as those which were past i withdrew my eyes but was not again deserted by my senses  on perceiving that i had recovered my sensibility he lifted his head this motion attracted my attention his countenance was mild but sorrow and astonishment sat upon his features i averted my eyes and feebly exclaimed  o fly  fly far and for ever  i cannot behold you and live  he did not rise upon his feet but olasped his hands and said in a tone of deprecation   i will fly i am become a fiend the sight of whom destroys yet tell me my offense you have linked curses with my name you ascribe to me a malice monstrous and infernal i look around all is loneliness and desert this house and your brothers are solitary and dismantled you die away at the sight of me my fear whispers that some deed of horror has been perpetrated that i am the undesigning cause  what language was this had he not avowed himself a ravisher had not this chamber witnessed his atrocious purposes i besought him with new vehemence to go  he lifted his eyes  great heaven what have i done i think i know the extent of my offenses i have acted but my actions have possibly effected more than i designed this fear has brought me back from my retreat i come to repair the evil of which my rashness was the cause and to prevent more evil i come to confess my errors  wretch i cried when my suffocating emotions would permit me to speak the ghosts of my sister and her children do they not rise to accuse thee who was it that blasted the intellects of wieland who was it that urged him to fury and guided him to murder who but thou and the devil with whom thou art confederated  at these words a new spirit pervaded his countenance his eyes once more appealed to heaven if i have memory if i have being i am innocent i intended no ill but my folly indirectly and remotely may have caused it but what words are these your brother lunatic his children dead  what should i infer from this deportment was he ignorance which these words implied real or pretended  yet how could i imagine a mere human agency in these events but if the influence was preternatural or maniacal in my brothers case they must be equally so in my own then i remembered that the voice exerted was to save me from carwins attempts these ideas tended to abate my abhorrence of this man and to detect the absurdity of my accusations  alas said i i have no one to accuse leave me to my fate fly from a scene stained with cruelty devoted to despair  carwin stood for a time musing and mournful at length he said what has happened i came to expiate my crimes let me know them in their full extent i have horrible forebodings what has happened  i was silent but recollecting the intimation given by this man when he was detected in my closet which implied some knowledge of that power which interfered in my favor i eagerly inquired what was that voice which called upon me to hold when i attempted to open the closet what face was that which i saw at the bottom of the stairs answer me truly  i came to confess the truth your allusions are horrible and strange perhaps i have but faint conceptions of the evils which my infatuation has produced but what remains i will perform it was my voice that you heard it was my face that you saw  for a moment i doubted whether my remembrance of events were not confused how could he be at once stationed at my shoulder and shut up in my closet how could he stand near me and yet be invisible but if carwins were the thrilling voice and the fiery visage which i had heard and seen then was he the prompter of my brother and the author of these dismal outrages  once more i averted my eyes and struggled for speech begone thou man of mischief remorseless and implacable miscreant begone  i will obey said he in a disconsolate voice yet wretch as i am am i unworthy to repair the evils that i have committed i came as a repentant criminal it is you whom i have injured and at your bar am i willing to appear and confess and expiate my crimes i have deceived you i have sported with your terrors i have plotted to destroy your reputation i come now to remove your errors to set you beyond the reach of similar fears to rebuild your fame as far as i am able  this is the amount of my guilt and this the fruit of my remorse will you not hear me listen to my confession and then denounce punishment all i ask is a patient audience  what i replied was not thine the voice that commanded my brother to imbrue his hands in the blood of his children  to strangle that angel of sweetness his wife has he not vowed my death and the death of pleyel at thy bidding have thou not made him the butcher of his family changed him who was the glory of his species into worse than brute robbed him of reason and consigned the rest of his days to fetters and stripes  carwins eyes glared and his limbs were petrified at this intelligence no words were requisite to prove him guiltless of these enormities at the time however i was nearly insensible to these exculpatory tokens he walked to the further end of the room and having recovered some degree of composure he spoke   i am not this villain i have slain no one i have prompted none to slay i have handled a tool of wonderful efficacy without malignant intentions but without caution ample will be the punishment of my temerity if my conduct has contributed to this evil he paused   i likewise was silent i struggled to command myself so far as to listen to the tale which he should tell observing this he continued   you are not apprized of the existence of a power which i possess i know not by what name to call it biloquium or ventrilocution sound is varied according to the variations of direction and distance the art of the ventriloquist consists in modifying his voice according to all these variations without changing his place see the work of the abbe de la chappelle in which are accurately recorded the performances of one of these artists and some ingenious though unsatisfactory speculations are given on the means by which the effects are produced this power is perhaps given by nature but is doubtless improvable if not acquirable by art it may possibly consist in an unusual flexibility or exertion of the bottom of the tongue and the uvula that speech is producible by these alone must be granted since anatomists mention two instances of persons speaking without a tongue in one case the organ was originally wanting but its place was supplied by a small tubercle and the uvula was perfect in the other the tongue was destroyed by disease but probably a small part of it remained  this power is difficult to explain but the fact is undeniable experience shows that the human voice can imitate the voice of all men and of all inferior animals the sound of musical instruments and even noises from the contact of inanimate substances have been accurately imitated the mimicry of animals is notorious and dr burney musical travels mentions one who imitated a flute and violin so as to deceive even his ears   it enables me to mimic exactly the voice of another and to modify the sound so that it shall appear to come from what quarter and be uttered at what distance i please  i know not that every one possesses this power perhaps though a casual position of my organs in my youth showed me that i possessed it it is an art which may be taught to all would to god i had died unknowing of the secret it has produced nothing but degradation and calamity  for a time the possession of so potent and stupendous an endowment elated me with pride unfortified by principle subjected to poverty stimulated by headlong passions i made this powerful engine subservient to the supply of my wants and the gratification of my vanity i shall not mention how diligently i cultivated this gift which seemed capable of unlimited improvement nor detail the various occasions on which it was successfully exerted to lead superstition conquer avarice or excite awe  i left america which is my native soil in my youth i have been engaged in various scenes of life in which my peculiar talent has been exercised with more or less success i was finally betrayed by one who called himself my friend into acts which cannot be justified though they are susceptible of apology  the perfidy of this man compelled me to withdraw from europe i returned to my native country uncertain whether silence and obscurity would save me from his malice i resided in the purlieus of the city i put on the garb and assumed the manners of a clown  my chief recreation was walking my principal haunts were the lawns and gardens of mettingen in this delightful region the luxuriances of nature had been chastened by judicious art and each successive contemplation unfolded new enchantments  i was studious of seclusion i was satiated with the intercourse of mankind and discretion required me to shun their intercourse for these reasons i long avoided the observation of your family and chiefly visited these precincts at night  i was never weary of admiring the position and ornaments of the temple many a night have i passed under its roof revolving no pleasing meditations when in my frequent rambles i perceived this apartment was occupied i gave a different direction to my steps one evening when a shower had just passed judging by the silence that no one was within i ascended to this building glancing carelessly round i perceived an open letter on the pedestal to read it was doubtless an offense against politeness of this offense however i was guilty  scarcely had i gone half through when i was alarmed by the approach of your brother to scramble down the cliff on the opposite side was impracticable i was unprepared to meet a stranger besides the aukwardness attending such an interview in these circumstances concealment was necessary to my safety a thousand times had i vowed never again to employ the dangerous talent which i possessed but such was the force of habit and the influence of present convenience that i used this method of arresting his progress and leading him back to the house with his errand whatever it was unperformed i had often caught parts from my station below of your conversation in this place and was well acquainted with the voice of your sister  some weeks after this i was again quietly seated in this recess the lateness of the hour secured me as i thought from all interruption in this however i was mistaken for wieland and pleyel as i judged by their voices earnest in dispute ascended the hill  i was not sensible that any inconvenience could possibly have flowed from my former exertion yet it was followed with compunction because it was a deviation from a path which i had assigned to myself now my aversion to this means of escape was enforced by an unauthorized curiosity and by the knowledge of a bushy hollow on the edge of the hill where i should be safe from discovery into this hollow i thrust myself  the propriety of removal to europe was the question eagerly discussed pleyel intimated that his anxiety to go was augmented by the silence of theresa de stolberg the temptation to interfere in this dispute was irresistible in vain i contended with inveterate habits i disguised to myself the impropriety of my conduct by recollecting the benefits which it might produce pleyels proposal was unwise yet it was enforced with plausible arguments and indefatigable zeal your brother might be puzzled and wearied but could not be convinced i conceived that to terminate the controversy in favor of the latter was conferring a benefit on all parties for this end i profited by an opening in the conversation and assured them of catharines irreconcilable aversion to the scheme and of the death of the saxon baroness the latter event was merely a conjecture but rendered extremely probable by pleyels representations my purpose you need not be told was effected  my passion for mystery and a species of imposture which i deemed harmless was thus awakened afresh this second lapse into error made my recovery more difficult i cannot convey to you an adequate idea of the kind of gratification which i derived from these exploits yet i meditated nothing my views were bounded to the passing moment and commonly suggested by the momentary exigence  i must not conceal any thing your principles teach you to abhor a voluptuous temper but with whatever reluctance i acknowledge this temper to be mine you imagine your servant judith to be innocent as well as beautiful but you took her from a family where hypocrisy as well as licentiousness was wrought into a system my attention was captivated by her charms and her principles were easily seen to be flexible  deem me not capable of the iniquity of seduction your servant is not destitute of feminine and virtuous qualities but she was taught that the best use of her charms consists in the sale of them my nocturnal visits to mettingen were now prompted by a double view and my correspondence with your servant gave me at all times access to your house  the second night after our interview so brief and so little foreseen by either of us some demon of mischief seized me according to my companions report your perfections were little less than divine her uncouth but copious narratives converted you into an object of worship she chiefly dwelt upon your courage because she herself was deficient in that quality you held apparitions and goblins in contempt you took no precautions against robbers you were just as tranquil and secure in this lonely dwelling as if you were in the midst of a crowd  hence a vague project occurred to me to put this courage to the test a woman capable of recollection in danger of warding off groundless panics of discerning the true mode of proceeding and profiting by her best resources is a prodigy i was desirous of ascertaining whether you were such an one  my expedient was obvious and simple i was to counterfeit a murderous dialogue but this was to be so conducted that another and not yourself should appear to be the object i was not aware of the possibility that you should appropriate these menaces to yourself had you been still and listened you would have heard the struggles and prayers of the victim who would likewise have appeared to be shut up in the closet and whose voice would have been judiths this scene would have been an appeal to your compassion and the proof of cowardice or courage which i expected from you would have been your remaining inactive in your bed or your entering the closet with a view to assist the sufferer some instances which judith related of your fearlesness and promptitude made me adopt the latter supposition with some degree of confidence  by the girls direction i found a ladder and mounted to your closet window this is scarcely large enough to admit the head but it answered my purpose too well  i cannot express my confusion and surprise at your abrupt and precipitate flight i hastily removed the ladder and after some pause curiosity and doubts of your safety induced me to follow you i found you stretched on the turf before your brothers door without sense or motion i felt the deepest regret at this unlooked for consequence of my scheme i knew not what to do to procure you relief the idea of awakening the family naturally presented itself this emergency was critical and there was no time to deliberate it was a sudden thought that occurred i put my lips to the keyhole and sounded an alarm which effectually roused the sleepers my organs were naturally forcible and had been improved by long and assiduous exercise  long and bitterly did i repent of my scheme i was somewhat consoled by reflecting that my purpose had not been evil and renewed my fruitless vows never to attempt such dangerous experiments for some time i adhered with laudable forbearance to this resolution  my life has been a life of hardship and exposure in the summer i prefer to make my bed of the smooth turf or at most the shelter of a summer house suffices in all my rambles i never found a spot in which so many picturesque beauties and rural delights were assembled as at mettingen no corner of your little domain unites fragrance and secrecy in so perfect a degree as the recess in the bank the odor of its leaves the coolness of its shade and the music of its waterfall had attracted my attention here my sadness was converted into peaceful melancholy  here my slumbers were sound and my pleasures enhanced  as most free from interruption i chose this as the scene of my midnight interviews with judith one evening as the sun declined i was seated here when i was alarmed by your approach it was with difficulty that i effected my escape unnoticed by you  at the customary hour i returned to your habitation and was made acquainted by judith with your unusual absence i half suspected the true cause and felt uneasiness at the danger there was that i should be deprived of my retreat or at least interrupted in the possession of it the girl likewise informed me that among your other singularities it was not uncommon for you to leave your bed and walk forth for the sake of nightairs and starlight contemplations  i desired to prevent this inconvenience i found you easily swayed by fear i was influenced in my choice of means by the facility and certainty of that to which i had been accustomed all that i forsaw was that in future this spot would be cautiously shunned by you  i entered the recess with the utmost caution and discovered by your breathings in what condition you were the unexpected interpretation which you placed upon my former proceeding suggested my conduct on the present occasion the mode in which heaven is said by the poet to interfere for the prevention of crimes  peeps through the blanket of the dark and cries hold hold  shakespeare was somewhat analogous to my province and never failed to occur to me at seasons like this it was requisite to break your slumbers and for this end i uttered the powerful monosyllable hold hold my purpose was not prescribed by duty yet surely it was far from being atrocious and inexpiable to effect it i uttered what was false but it was well suited to my purpose nothing less was intended than to injure you nay the evil resulting from my former act was partly removed by assuring you that in all places but this you were safe  chapter xxiii my morals will appear to you far from rigid yet my conduct will fall short of your suspicions i am now to confess actions less excusable and yet surely they will not entitle me to the name of a desperate or sordid criminal  your house was rendered by your frequent and long absences easily accessible to my curiosity my meeting with pleyel was the prelude to direct intercourse with you i had seen much of the world but your character exhibited a specimen of human powers that was wholly new to me my intercourse with your servant furnished me with curious details of your domestic management i was of a different sex i was not your husband i was not even your friend yet my knowledge of you was of that kind which conjugal intimacies can give and in some respects more accurate the observation of your domestic was guided by me  you will not be surprised that i should sometimes profit by your absence and adventure to examine with my own eyes the interior of your chamber upright and sincere you used no watchfulness and practiced no precautions i scrutinized every thing and pried every where your closet was usually locked but it was once my fortune to find the key on a bureau i opened and found new scope for my curiosity in your books one of these was manuscript and written in characters which essentially agreed with a shorthand system which i had learned from a jesuit missionary  i cannot justify my conduct yet my only crime was curiosity i perused this volume with eagerness the intellect which it unveiled was brighter than my limited and feeble organs could bear i was naturally inquisitive as to your ideas respecting my deportment and the mysteries that had lately occurred  you know what you have written you know that in this volume the key to your inmost soul was contained if i had been a profound and malignant impostor what plenteous materials were thus furnished me of stratagems and plots  the coincidence of your dream in the summer house with my exclamation was truly wonderful the voice which warned you to forbear was doubtless mine but mixed by a common process of the fancy with the train of visionary incidents  i saw in a stronger light than ever the dangerousness of that instrument which i employed and renewed my resolutions to abstain from the use of it in future but i was destined perpetually to violate my resolutions by some perverse fate i was led into circumstances in which the exertion of my powers was the sole or the best means of escape  on that memorable night on which our last interview took place i came as usual to mettingen i was apprized of your engagement at your brothers from which you did not expect to return till late some incident suggested the design of visiting your chamber among your books which i had not examined might be something tending to illustrate your character or the history of your family some intimation had been dropped by you in discourse respecting a performance of your father in which some important transaction in his life wa recorded  i was desirous of seeing this book and such was my habitual attachment to mystery that i preferred the clandestine perusal of it such were the motives that induced me to make this attempt judith had disappeared and finding the house unoccupied i supplied myself with a light and proceede to your chamber  i found it easy on experiment to lock an unlock your closet door without the aid of a key i shut myself in this recess and was busily exploring your shelves when i heard some one ente the room below i was at a loss who it could be whether you or your servant doubtful however as i was i conceived it prudent to extinguish the light scarcely was this done when some on entered the chamber the footsteps were easil distinguished to be yours  my situation was now full of danger and perplexity for some time i cherished the hope tha you would leave the room so long as to afford m an opportunity of escaping as the hours passed this hope gradually deserted me it was plain tha you had retired for the night  i knew not how soon you might find occasion to enter the closet i was alive to all the horror of detection and ruminated without ceasing o the behavior which it would be proper in case o detection to adopt i was unable to discover an consistent method of accounting for my being thu immured  it occurred to me that i might withdraw you from your chamber for a few minutes by counterfeiting a voice from without some message from your brother might be delivered requiring your presence at his house i was deterred from this scheme by reflecting on the resolution i had formed and on the possible evils that might result from it besides it was not improbable that you would speedily retire to bed and then by the exercise of sufficient caution i might hope to escape unobserved  meanwhile i listened with the deepest anxiety to every motion from without i discovered nothing which betokened preparation for sleep instead of this i heard deepdrawn sighs and occasionally an halfexpressed and mournful ejaculation hence i inferred that you were unhappy the true state of your mind with regard to pleyel your own pen had disclosed but i supposed you to be framed of such materials that though a momentary sadness might affect you you were impregnable to any permanent and heartfelt grief inquietude for my own safety was for a moment suspended by sympathy with your distress  to the former consideration i was quickly recalled by a motion of yours which indicated i knew not what i fostered the persuasion that you would now retire to bed but presently you approached the closet and detection seemed to be inevitable you put your hand upon the lock i had formed no plan to extricate myself from the dilemma in which the opening of the door would involve me i felt an irreconcilable aversion to detection thus situated i involuntarily seized the door with a resolution to resist your efforts to open it  suddenly you receded from the door this deportment was inexplicable but the relief it afforded me was quickly gone you returned and i once more was thrown into perplexity the expedient that suggested itself was precipitate and inartificial i exerted my organs and called upon you to hold  that you should persist in spite of this admonition was a subject of astonishment i again resisted your efforts for the first expedient having failed i knew not what other to resort to in this state how was my astonishment increased when i heard your exclamations  it was now plain that you knew me to be within further resistance was unavailing and useless the door opened and i shrunk backward seldom have i felt deeper mortification and more painful perplexity i did not consider that the truth would be less injurious than any lie which i could hastily frame conscious as i was of a certain degree of guilt i conceived that you would form the most odious suspicions the truth would be imperfect unless i were likewise to explain the mysterious admonition which had been given but that explanation was of too great moment and involved too extensive consequences to make me suddenly resolve to give it  i was aware that this discovery would associate itself in your mind with the dialogue formerly heard in this closet thence would your suspicions be aggravated and to escape from these suspicions would be impossible but the mere truth would be sufficiently opprobrious and deprive me for ever of your good opinion  thus was i rendered desperate and my mind rapidly passed to the contemplation of the use that might be made of previous events some good genius would appear to you to have interposed to save you from injury intended by me why i said since i must sink in her opinion should i not cherish this belief why not personate an enemy and pretend that celestial interference has frustrated my schemes i must fly but let me leave wonder and fear behind me elucidation of the mystery will always be practicable i shall do no injury but merely talk of evil that was designed but is now past  thus i extenuated my conduct to myself but i scarcely expect that this will be to you a sufficient explication of the scene that followed those habits which i have imbibed the rooted passion which possesses me for scattering around me amazement and fear you enjoy no opportunities of knowing that a man should wantonly impute to himself the most flagitious designs will hardly be credited even though you reflect that my reputation was already by my own folly irretrievably ruined and that it was always in my power to communicate the truth and rectify the mistake  i left you to ponder on this scene my mind was full of rapid and incongruous ideas compunction selfupbraiding hopelesness satisfaction at the view of those effects likely to flow from my new scheme misgivings as to the beneficial result of this scheme took possession of my mind and seemed to struggle for the mastery  i had gone too far to recede i had painted myself to you as an assassin and ravisher withheld from guilt only by a voice from heaven i had thus reverted into the path of error and now having gone thus far my progress seemed to be irrevocable i said to myself i must leave these precincts for ever my acts have blasted my fame in the eyes of the wielands for the sake of creating a mysterious dread i have made myself a villain i may complete this mysterious plan by some new imposture but i cannot aggravate my supposed guilt  my resolution was formed and i was swiftly ruminating on the means for executing it when pleyel appeared in sight this incident decided my conduct it was plain that pleyel was a devoted lover but he was at the same time a man of cold resolves and exquisite sagacity to deceive him would be the sweetest triumph i had ever enjoyed the deception would be momentary but it would likewise be complete that his delusion would so soon be rectified was a recommendation to my scheme for i esteemed him too much to desire to entail upon him lasting agonies  i had no time to reflect further for he proceeded with a quick step toward the house i was hurried onward involuntarily and by a mechanical impulse i followed him as he passed the recess in the bank and shrowding myself in that spot i counterfeited sounds which i knew would arrest his steps  he stopped turned listened approached and overheard a dialogue whose purpose was to vanquish his belief in a point where his belief was most difficult to vanquish i exerted all my powers to imitate your voice your general sentiments and your language being master by means of your journal of your personal history and most secret thoughts my efforts were the more successful when i reviewed the tenor of this dialogue i cannot believe but that pleyel was deluded when i think of your character and of the inferences which this dialogue was intended to suggest it seems incredible that this delusion should be produced  i spared not myself i called myself murderer thief guilty of innumerable perjuries and misdeeds that you had debased yourself to the level of such an one no evidence methought would suffice to convince him who knew you so thoroughly as pleyel and yet the imposture amounted to proof which the most jealous scrutiny would find to be unexceptionable  he left his station precipitately and resumed his way to the house i saw that the detection of his error would be instantaneous since not having gone to bed an immediate interview would take place between you at first this circumstance was considered with regret but as time opened my eyes to the possible consequences of this scene i regarded it with pleasure  in a short time the infatuation which had led me thus far began to subside the remembrance of former reasonings and transactions was renewed how often i had repented this kind of exertion how many evils were produced by it which i had not foreseen what occasions for the bitterest remorse it had administered now passed through my mind the black catalogue of stratagems was now increased i had inspired you with the most vehement terrors i had filled your mind with faith in shadows and confidence in dreams i had depraved the imagination of pleyel i had exhibited you to his understanding as devoted to brutal gratifications and consummate in hypocrisy the evidence which accompanied this delusion would be irresistible to one whose passion had perverted his judgment whose jealousy with regard to me had already been excited and who therefore would not fail to overrate the force of this evidence what fatal act of despair or of vengeance might not this error produce  with regard to myself i had acted with a phrenzy that surpassed belief i had warred against my peace and my fame i had banished myself from the fellowship of vigorous and pure minds i was selfexpelled from a scene which the munificence of nature had adorned with unrivalled beauties and from haunts in which all the muses and humanities had taken refuge  i was thus torn by conflicting fears and tumultuous regrets the night passed away in this state of confusion and next morning in the gazette left at my obscure lodging i read a description and an offer of reward for the apprehension of my person i was said to have escaped from an irish prison in which i was confined as an offender convicted of enormous and complicated crimes  this was the work of an enemy who by falsehood and stratagem had procured my condemnation i was indeed a prisoner but escaped by the exertion of my powers the fate to which i was doomed but which i did not deserve i had hoped that the malice of my foe was exhausted but i now perceived that my precautions had been wise for that the intervention of an ocean was insufficient for my security  let me not dwell on the sensations which this discovery produced i need not tell by what steps i was induced to seek an interview with you for the purpose of disclosing the truth and repairing as far as possible the effects of my misconduct it was unavoidable that this gazette would fall into your hands and that it would tend to confirm every erroneous impression  having gained this interview i purposed to seek some retreat in the wilderness inaccessible to your inquiry and to the malice of my foe where i might henceforth employ myself in composing a faithtul narrative of my actions i designed it as my vindication from the aspersions that had rested on my character and as a lesson to mankind on the evils of credulity on the one hand and of imposture on the other  i wrote you a billet which was left at the house of your friend and which i knew would by some means speedily come to your hands i entertained a faint hope that my invitation would be complied with i knew not what use you would make of the opportunity which this proposal afforded you of procuring the seizure of my person but this fate i was determined to avoid and i had no doubt but due circumspection and the exercise of the faculty which i possessed would enable me to avoid it  i lurked through the day in the neighborhood of mettingen i approached your habitation at the appointed hour i entered it in silence by a trapdoor which led into the cellar this had formerly been bolted on the inside but judith had at an early period in our intercourse removed this impediment i ascended to the first floor but met with no one nor any thing that indicated the presence of an human being  i crept softly up stairs and at length perceived your chamber door to be opened and a light to be within it was of moment to discover by whom this light was accompanied i was sensible of the inconveniences to which my being discovered at your chamber door by any one within would subject me i therefore called out in my own voice but so modified that it should appear to ascend from the court below who is in the chamber is it miss wieland  no answer was returned to this summons i listened but no motion could be heard after a pause i repeated my call but no less ineffectually  i now approached nearer the door and adventured to look in a light stood on the table but nothing human was discernible i entered cautiously but all was solitude and stillness  i knew not what to conclude if the house were inhabited my call would have been noticed yet some suspicion insinuated itself that silence was studiously kept by persons who intended to surprise me my approach had been wary and the silence that ensued my call had likewise preceded it a circumstance that tended to dissipate my fears  at length it occurred to me that judith might possibly be in her own room i turned my steps thither but she was not to be found i passed into other rooms and was soon convinced that the house was totally deserted i returned to your chamber agitated by vain surmises and opposite conjectures the appointed hour had passed and i dismissed the hope of an interview  in this state of things i determined to leave a few lines on your toilet and prosecute my journey to the mountains scarcely had i taken the pen when i laid it aside uncertain in what manner to address you i rose from the table and walked across the floor a glance thrown upon the bed acquainted me with a spectacle to which my conceptions of horror had not yet reached  in the midst of shuddering and trepidation the signal of your presence in the court below recalled me to myself the deed was newly done i only was in the house what had lately happened justified any suspicions however enormous it was plain that this catastrophe was unknown to you i thought upon the wild commotion which the discovery would awaken in your breast i found the confusion of my own thoughts unconquerable and perceived that the end for which i sought an interview was not now to be accomplished  in this state of things it was likewise expedient to conceal my being within i put out the light and hurried down stairs to my unspeakable surprise notwithstanding every motive to fear you lighted a candle and proceeded to your chamber  i retired to that room below from which a door leads into the cellar this door concealed me from your view as you passed i thought upon the spectacle which was about to present itself in an exigence so abrupt and so little foreseen i was again subjected to the empire of mechanical and habitual impulses i dreaded the effects which this shocking exhibition bursting on your unprepared senses might produce  thus actuated i stepped swiftly to the door and thrusting my head forward once more pronounced the mysterious interdiction at that moment by some untoward fate your eyes were cast back and you saw me in the very act of utterance i fled through the darksome avenue at which i entered covered with the shame of this detection  with diligence stimulated by a thousand ineffable emotions i pursued my intended journey i have a brother whose farm is situated in the bosom of a fertile desert near the sources of the leheigh and thither i now repaired  chapter xxiv deeply did i ruminate on the occurrences that had just passed nothing excited my wonder so much as the means by which you discovered my being in the closet this discovery appeared to be made at the moment when you attempted to open it how could you have otherwise remained so long in the chamber apparently fearless and tranquil and yet having made this discovery how could you persist in dragging me forth persist in defiance of an interdiction so emphatical and solemn  but your sisters death was an event detestable and ominous she had been the victim of the most dreadful species of assassination how in a state like yours the murderous intention could be generated was wholly inconceivable  i did not relinquish my design of confessing to you the part which i had sustained in your family but i was willing to defer it till the task which i had set myself was finished that being done i resumed the resolution the motives to incite me to this continually acquired force the more i revolved the events happening at mettingen the more insupportable and ominous my terrors became my waking hours and my sleep were vexed by dismal presages and frightful intimations  catharine was dead by violence surely my malignant stars had not made me the cause of her death yet had i not rashly set in motion a machine over whose progress i had no control and which experience had shown me was infinite in power every day might add to the catalogue of horrors of which this was the source and a seasonable disclosure of the truth might prevent numberless ills  fraught with this conception i have turned my steps hither i find your brothers house desolate the furniture removed and the walls stained with damps your own is in the same situation your chamber is dismantled and dark and you exhibit an image of incurable grief and of rapid decay  i have uttered the truth this is the extent of my offenses you tell me an horrid tale of wieland being led to the destruction of his wife and children by some mysterious agent you charge me with the guilt of this agency but i repeat that the amount of my guilt has been truly stated the perpetrator of catharines death was unknown to me till now nay it is still unknown to me  at that moment the closing of a door in the kitchen was distinctly heard by us carwin started and paused there is some one coming i must not be found here by my enemies and need not since my purpose is answered  i had drunk in with the most vehement attention every word that he had uttered i had no breath to interrupt his tale by interrogations or comments the power that he spoke of was hitherto unknown to me its existence was incredible it was susceptible of no direct proof  he owns that his were the voice and face which i heard and saw he attempts to give an human explanation of these phantasms but it is enough that he owns himself to be the agent his tale is a lie and his nature devilish as he deceived me he likewise deceived my brother and now do i behold the author of all our calamities  such were my thoughts when his pause allowed me to think i should have bad him begone if the silence had not been interrupted but now i feared no more for myself and the milkiness of my nature was curdled into hatred and rancour some one was near and this enemy of god and man might possibly be brought to justice i reflected not that the preternatural power which he had hitherto exerted would avail to rescue him from any toils in which his feet might be entangled meanwhile looks and not words of menace and abhorrence were all that i could bestow  he did not depart he seemed dubious whether by passing out of the house or by remaining somewhat longer where he was he should most endanger his safety his confusion increased when steps of one barefoot were heard upon the stairs he threw anxious glances sometimes at the closet sometimes at the window and sometimes at the chamber door yet he was detained by some inexplicable fascination he stood as if rooted to the spot  as to me my soul was bursting with detestation and revenge i had no room for surmises and fears respecting him that approached it was doubtless a human being and would befriend me so far as to aid me in arresting this offender  the stranger quickly entered the room my eyes and the eyes of carwin were at the same moment darted upon him a second glance was not needed to inform us who he was his locks were tangled and fell confusedly over his forehead and ears his shirt was of coarse stuff and open at the neck and breast his coat was once of bright and fine texture but now torn and tarnished with dust his feet his legs and his arms were bare his features were the seat of a wild and tranquil solemnity but his eyes bespoke inquietude and curiosity  he advanced with firm step and looking as in search of some one he saw me and stopped he bent his sight on the floor and clenching his hands appeared suddenly absorbed in meditation such were the figure and deportment of wieland such in his fallen state were the aspect and guise of my brother  carwin did not fail to recognize the visitant care for his own safety was apparently swallowed up in the amazement which this spectacle produced his station was conspicuous and he could not have escaped the roving glances of wieland yet the latter seemed totally unconscious of his presence  grief at this scene of ruin and blast was at first the only sentiment of which i was conscious a fearful stillness ensued at length wieland lifting his hands which were locked in each other to his breast exclaimed father i thank thee this is thy guidance hither thou have led me that i might perform thy will yet let me not err let me hear again thy messenger  he stood for a minute as if listening but recovering from his attitude he continued  it is not needed dastardly wretch thus eternally questioning the behests of thy maker weak in resolution wayward in faith  he advanced to me and after another pause resumed poor girl a dismal fate has set its mark upon thee thy life is demanded as a sacrifice prepare thee to die make not my office difficult by fruitless opposition thy prayers might subdue stones but none but he who enjoined my purpose can shake it  these words were a sufficient explication of the scene the nature of his phrenzy as described by my uncle was remembered i who had sought death was now thrilled with horror because it was near death in this form death from the hand of a brother was thought upon with undescribable repugnance  in a state thus verging upon madness my eye glanced upon carwin his astonishment appeared to have struck him motionless and dumb my life was in danger and my brothers hand was about to be embrued in my blood i firmly believed that carwins was the instigation i could rescue me from this abhorred fate i could dissipate this tremendous illusion i could save my brother from the perpetration of new horrors by pointing out the devil who seduced him to hesitate a moment was to perish these thoughts gave strength to my limbs and energy to my accents i started on my feet  o brother spare me spare thyself there is thy betrayer he counterfeited the voice and face of an angel for the purpose of destroying thee and me he has this moment confessed it he is able to speak where he is not he is leagued with hell but will not avow it yet he confesses that the agency was his  my brother turned slowly his eyes and fixed them upon carwin every joint in the frame of the latter trembled his complexion was paler than a ghosts his eye dared not meet that of wieland but wandered with an air of distraction from one space to another  man said my brother in a voice totally unlike that which he had used to me what art thou the charge has been made answer it the visage  the voice  at the bottom of these stairs  at the hour of eleven  to whom did they belong to thee  twice did carwin attempt to speak but his words died away upon his lips my brother resumed in a tone of greater vehemence   thou falterest faltering is ominous say yes or no one word will suffice but beware of falsehood was it a stratagem of hell to overthrow my family wast thou the agent  i now saw that the wrath which had been prepared for me was to be heaped upon another the tale that i heard from him and his present trepidations were abundant testimonies of his guilt but what if wieland should be undeceived what if he shall find his acts to have proceeded not from an heavenly prompter but from human treachery will not his rage mount into whirlwind will not he tare limb from limb this devoted wretch  instinctively i recoiled from this image but it gave place to another carwin may be innocent but the impetuosity of his judge may misconstrue his answers into a confession of guilt wieland knows not that mysterious voices and appearances were likewise witnessed by me carwin may be ignorant of those which misled my brother thus may his answers unwarily betray himself to ruin  such might be the consequences of my frantic precipitation and these it was necessary if possible to prevent i attempted to speak but wieland turning suddenly upon me commanded silence in a tone furious and terrible my lips closed and my tongue refused its office  what art thou he resumed addressing himself to carwin answer me whose form  whose voice  was it thy contrivance answer me  the answer was now given but confusedly and scarcely articulated i meant nothing  i intended no ill  if i understand  if i do not mistake you  it is too true  i did appear  in the entry  did speak the contrivance was mine but    these words were no sooner uttered than my brother ceased to wear the same aspect his eyes were downcast he was motionless his respiration became hoarse like that of a man in the agonies of death carwin seemed unable to say more he might have easily escaped but the thought which occupied him related to what was horrid and unintelligible in this scene and not to his own danger  presently the faculties of wieland which for a time were chained up were seized with restlessness and trembling he broke silence the stoutest heart would have been appalled by the tone in which he spoke he addressed himself to carwin  why art thou here who detains thee go and learn better i will meet thee but it must be at the bar of thy maker there shall i bear witness against thee  perceiving that carwin did not obey he continued do thou wish me to complete the catalogue by thy death thy life is a worthless thing tempt me no more i am but a man and thy presence may awaken a fury which may spum my control begone  carwin irresolute striving in vain for utterance his complexion pallid as death his knees beating one against another slowly obeyed the mandate and withdrew  chapter xxv a few words more and i lay aside the pen for ever yet why should i not relinquish it now all that i have said is preparatory to this scene and my fingers tremulous and cold as my heart refuse any further exertion this must not be let my last energies support me in the finishing of this task then will i lay down my head in the lap of death hushed will be all my murmurs in the sleep of the grave  every sentiment has perished in my bosom even friendship is extinct your love for me has prompted me to this task but i would not have complied if it had not been a luxury thus to feast upon my woes i have justly calculated upon my remnant of strength when i lay down the pen the taper of life will expire my existence will terminate with my tale  now that i was left alone with wieland the perils of my situation presented themselves to my mind that this paroxysm should terminate in havoc and rage it was reasonable to predict the first suggestion of my fears had been disproved by my experience carwin had acknowledged his offenses and yet had escaped the vengence which i had harbored had not been admitted by wieland and yet the evils which i had endured compared with those inflicted on my brother were as nothing i thirsted for his blood and was tormented with an insatiable appetite for his destruction yet my brother was unmoved and had dismissed him in safety surely thou wast more than man while i am sunk below the beasts  did i place a right construction on the conduct of wieland was the error that misled him so easily rectified were views so vivid and faith so strenuous thus liable to fading and to change was there not reason to doubt the accuracy of my perceptions with images like these was my mind thronged till the deportment of my brother called away my attention  i saw his lips move and his eyes cast up to heaven then would he listen and look back as if in expectation of some ones appearance thrice he repeated these gesticulations and this inaudible prayer each time the mist of confusion and doubt seemed to grow darker and to settle on his understanding i guessed at the meaning of these tokens the words of carwin had shaken his belief and he was employed in summoning the messenger who had formerly communed with him to attest the value of those new doubts in vain the summons was repeated for his eye met nothing but vacancy and not a sound saluted his ear  he walked to the bed gazed with eagerness at the pillow which had sustained the head of the breathless catharine and then returned to the place where i sat i had no power to lift my eyes to his face i was dubious of his purpose this purpose might aim at my life  alas nothing but subjection to danger and exposure to temptation can show us what we are by this test was i now tried and found to be cowardly and rash men can deliberately untie the thread of life and of this i had deemed myself capable yet now that i stood upon the brink of fate that the knife of the sacrificer was aimed at my heart i shuddered and betook myself to any means of escape however monstrous  can i bear to think  can i endure to relate the outrage which my heart meditated where were my means of safety resistance was vain not even the energy of despair could set me on a level with that strength which his terrify prompter had bestowed upon wieland terror enables us to perform incredible feats but terror was not then the state of my mind where then were my hopes of rescue  methinks it is too much i stand aside as it were from myself i estimate my own deservings a hatred immortal and inexorable is my due i listen to my own pleas and find them empty and false yes i acknowledge that my guilt surpasses that of all mankind i confess that the curses of a world and the frowns of a deity are inadequate to my demerits is there a thing in the world worthy of infinite abhorrence it is i  what shall i say i was menaced as i thought with death and to elude this evil my hand was ready to inflict death upon the menacer in visiting my house i had made provision against the machinations of carwin in a fold of my dress an open penknife was concealed this i now seized and drew forth it lurked out of view but i now see that my state of mind would have rendered the deed inevitable if my brother had lifted his hand this instrument of my preservation would have been plunged into his heart  o insupportable remembrance hide thee from my view for a time hide it from me that my heart was black enough to meditate the stabbing of a brother a brother thus supreme in misery thus towering in virtue  he was probably unconscious of my design but presently drew back this interval was sufficient to restore me to myself the madness the iniquity of that act which i had purposed rushed upon my apprehension for a moment i was breathless with agony at the next moment i recovered my strength and threw the knife with violence on the floor  the sound awoke my brother from his reverie he gazed alternately at me and at the weapon with a movement equally solemn he stooped and took it up he placed the blade in different positions scrutinizing it accurately and maintaining at the same time a profound silence  again he looked at me but all that vehemence and loftiness of spirit which had so lately characterized his features were flown fallen muscles a forehead contracted into folds eyes dim with unbidden drops and a ruefulness of aspect which no words can describe were now visible  his looks touched into energy the same sympathies in me and i poured forth a flood of tears this passion was quickly checked by fear which had now no longer my own but his safety for their object i watched his deportment in silence at length he spoke  sister said he in an accent mournful and mild i have acted poorly my part in this world what think thou shall i not do better in the next  i could make no answer the mildness of his tone astonished and encouraged me i continued to regard him with wistful and anxious looks  i think resumed he i will try my wife and my babes have gone before happy wretches i have sent you to repose and ought not to linger behind  these words had a meaning sufficiently intelligible i looked at the open knife in his hand and shuddered but knew not how to prevent the deed which i dreaded he quickly noticed my fears and comprehended them stretching toward me his hand with an air of increasing mildness take it said he fear not for thy own sake nor for mine the cup is gone by and its transient inebriation is succeeded by the soberness of truth  thou angel whom i was wont to worship fear thou my sister for thy life once it was the scope of my labors to destroy thee but i was prompted to the deed by heaven such at least was my belief think thou that thy death was sought to gratify malevolence no i am pure from all stain i believed that my god was my mover  neither thee nor myself have i cause to injure i have done my duty and surely there is merit in having sacrificed to that all that is dear to the heart of man if a devil has deceived me he came in the habit of an angel if i erred it was not my judgment that deceived me but my senses in thy sight being of beings i am still pure still will i look for my reward in thy justice  did my ears truly report these sounds if i did not err my brother was restored to just perceptions he knew himself to have been betrayed to the murder of his wife and children to have been the victim of internal artifice yet he found consolation in the rectitude of his motives he was not devoid of sorrow for this was written on his countenance but his soul was tranquil and sublime  perhaps this was merely a transition of his former madness into a new shape perhaps he had not yet awakened to the memory of the horrors which he had perpetrated infatuated wretch that i was to set myself up as a model by which to judge of my heroic brother my reason taught me that his conclusions were right but conscious of the impotence of reason over my own conduct conscious of my cowardly rashness and my criminal despair i doubted whether any one could be steadfast and wise  such was my weakness that even in the midst of these thoughts my mind glided into abhorrence of carwin and i uttered in a low voice o carwin carwin what have thou to answer for  my brother immediately noticed the involuntary exclamation clara said he be thyself equity used to be a theme for thy eloquence reduce its lessons to practice and be just to that unfortunate man the instrument has done its work and i am satisfied  i thank thee my god for this last illumination my enemy is thine also i deemed him to be man the man with whom i have often communed but now thy goodness has unveiled to me his true nature as the performer of thy behests he is my friend  my heart began now to misgive me his mournful aspect had gradually yielded place to a serene brow a new soul appeared to actuate his frame and his eyes to beam with preternatural luster these symptoms did not abate and he continued  clara i must not leave thee in doubt i know not what brought about thy interview with the being whom thou call carwin for a time i was guilty of thy error and deduced from his incoherent confessions that i had been made the victim of human malice he left us at my bidding and i put up a prayer that my doubts should be removed thy eyes were shut and thy ears sealed to the vision that answered my prayer  i was indeed deceived the form thou have seen was the incarnation of a demon the visage and voice which urged me to the sacrifice of my family were his now he personates a human form then he was environed with the luster of heaven   clara he continued advancing closer to me thy death must come this minister is evil but he from whom his commission was received is god submit then with all thy wonted resignation to a decree that cannot be reversed or resisted mark the clock three minutes are allowed to thee in which to call up thy fortitude and prepare thee for thy doom there he stopped  even now when this scene exists only in memory when life and all its functions have sunk into torpor my pulse throbs and my hairs uprise my brows are knit as then and i gaze around me in distraction i was unconquerably averse to death but death imminent and full of agony as that which was threatened was nothing this was not the only or chief inspirer of my fears  for him not for myself was my soul tormented i might die and no crime surpassing the reach of mercy would pursue me to the presence of my judge but my assassin would survive to contemplate his deed and that assassin was wieland  wings to bear me beyond his reach i had not i could not vanish with a thought the door was open but my murderer was interposed between that and me of selfdefence i was incapable the phrenzy that lately prompted me to blood was gone my state was desperate my rescue was impossible  the weight of these accumulated thoughts could not be borne my sight became confused my limbs were seized with convulsion i spoke but my words were halfformed   spare me my brother look down righteous judge snatch me from this fate take away this fury from him or turn it elsewhere  such was the agony of my thoughts that i noticed not steps entering my apartment supplicating eyes were cast upward but when my prayer was breathed i once more wildly gazed at the door a form met my sight i shuddered as if the god whom i invoked were present it was carwin that again intruded and who stood before me erect in attitude and steadfast in look  the sight of him awakened new and rapid thoughts his recent tale was remembered his magical transitions and mysterious energy of voice whether he were infernal or miraculous or human there was no power and no need to decide whether the contriver or not of this spell he was able to unbind it and to check the fury of my brother he had ascribed to himself intentions not malignant here now was afforded a test of his truth let him interpose as from above revoke the savage decree which the madness of wieland has assigned to heaven and extinguish for ever this passion for blood  my mind detected at a glance this avenue to safety the recommendations it possessed thronged as it were together and made but one impression on my intellect remoter effects and collateral dangers i saw not perhaps the pause of an instant had sufficed to call them up the improbability that the influence which governed wieland was external or human the tendency of this stratagem to sanction so fatal an error or substitute a more destructive rage in place of this the sufficiency of carwins mere muscular forces to counteract the efforts and restrain the fury of wieland might at a second glance have been discovered but no second glance was allowed my first thought hurried me to action and fixing my eyes upon carwin i exclaimed   o wretch once more have thou come let it be to abjure thy malice to counterwork this hellish stratagem to turn from me and from my brother this desolating rage  testify thy innocence or thy remorse exert the powers which pertain to thee whatever they be to turn aside this ruin thou art the author of these horrors what have i done to deserve thus to die how have i merited this unrelenting persecution i adjure thee by that god whose voice thou have dared to counterfeit to save my life  will thou then go leave me succourless  carwin listened to my entreaties unmoved and turned from me he seemed to hesitate a moment then glided through the door rage and despair stifled my utterance the interval of respite was passed the pangs reserved for me by wieland were not to be endured my thoughts rushed again into anarchy having received the knife from his hand i held it loosely and without regard but now it seized again my attention and i grasped it with force  he seemed to notice not the entrance or exit of carwin my gesture and the murderous weapon appeared to have escaped his notice his silence was unbroken his eye fixed upon the clock for a time was now withdrawn fury kindled in every feature all that was human in his face gave way to an expression supernatural and tremendous i felt my left arm within his grasp   even now i hesitated to strike i shrunk from his assault but in vain   here let me desist why should i rescue this event from oblivion why should i paint this detestable conflict why not terminate at once this series of horrors  hurry to the verge of the precipice and cast myself for ever beyond remembrance and beyond hope  still i live with this load upon my breast with this phantom to pursue my steps with adders lodged in my bosom and stinging me to madness still i consent to live  yes i will rise above the sphere of mortal passions i will spurn at the cowardly remorse that bids me seek impunity in silence or comfort in forgetfulness my nerves shall be new strung to the task have i not resolved i will die the gulf before me is inevitable and near i will die but then only when my tale is at an end  chapter xxvi my right hand grasping the unseen knife was still disengaged it was lifted to strike all my strength was exhausted but what was sufficient to the performance of this deed already was the energy awakened and the impulse given that should bear the fatal steel to his heart when  wieland shrunk back his hand was withdrawn breathless with affright and desperation i stood freed from his grasp unassailed untouched  thus long had the power which controuled the scene forborne to interfere but now his might was irresistible and wieland in a moment was disarmed of all his purposes a voice louder than human organs could produce shriller than language can depict burst from the ceiling and commanded him  to hold  trouble and dismay succeeded to the stedfastness that had lately been displayed in the looks of wieland his eyes roved from one quarter to another with an expression of doubt he seemed to wait for a further intimation  carwins agency was here easily recognized i had besought him to interpose in my defense he had flown i had imagined him deaf to my prayer and resolute to see me perish yet he disappeared merely to devise and execute the means of my relief  why did he not forbear when this end was accomplished why did his misjudging zeal and accursed precipitation overpass that limit or meant he thus to crown the scene and conduct his inscrutable plots to this consummation  such ideas were the fruit of subsequent contemplation this moment was pregnant with fate i had no power to reason in the career of my tempestuous thoughts rent into pieces as my mind was by accumulating horrors carwin was unseen and unsuspected i partook of wielands credulity shook with his amazement and panted with his awe  silence took place for a moment so much as allowed the attention to recover its post then new sounds were uttered from above  man of errors cease to cherish thy delusion not heaven or hell but thy senses have misled thee to commit these acts shake off thy phrenzy and ascend into rational and human be lunatic no longer  my brother opened his lips to speak his tone was terrific and faint he muttered an appeal to heaven it was difficult to comprehend the theme of his inquiries they implied doubt as to the nature of the impulse that hitherto had guided him and questioned whether he had acted in consequence of insane perceptions  to these interrogatories the voice which now seemed to hover at his shoulder loudly answered in the affirmative then uninterrupted silence ensued  fallen from his losty and heroic station now finally restored to the perception of truth weighed to earth by the recollection of his own deeds consoled no longer by a consciousness of rectitude for the loss of offspring and wife  a loss for which he was indebted to his own misguided hand wieland was transformed at once into the man of sorrows  he reflected not that credit should be as reasonably denied to the last as to any former intimation that one might as justly be ascribe to erring or diseased senses as the other he saw not that this discovery in no degree affected the integrity of his conduct that his motives had lost none of their claims to the homage of mankind that the preference of supreme good and the boundless energy of duty were undiminished in his bosom  it is not for me to pursue him through the ghastly changes of his countenance words he had none now he sat upon the floor motionless in all his limbs with his eyes glazed and fixed a monument of woe  anon a spirit of tempestuous but undesigning activity seized him he rose from his place and strode across the floor tottering and at random his eyes were without moisture and gleamed with the fire that consumed his vitals the muscles of his face were agitated by convulsion his lips moved but no sound escaped him  that nature should long sustain this conflict was not to be believed my state was little different from that of my brother i entered as it were into his thought my heart was visited and rent by his pangs  oh that thy phrenzy had never been cured that thy madness with its blissful visions would return or if that must not be that thy scene would hasten to a close that death would cover thee with his oblivion  what can i wish for thee thou who have vied with the great preacher of thy faith in sanctity of motives and in elevation above sensual and selfish thou whom thy fate has changed into paricide and savage can i wish for the continuance of thy being no  for a time his movements seemed destitute of purpose if he walked if he turned if his fingers were entwined with each other if his hands were pressed against opposite sides of his head with a force sufficient to crush it into pieces it was to tear his mind from selfcontemplation to waste his thoughts on external objects  speedily this train was broken a beam appeared to be darted into hs mind which gave a purpose to his efforts an avenue to escape presented itself and now he eagerly gazed about him when my thoughts became engaged by his demeanor my fingers were stretched as by a mechanical force and the knife no longer heeded or of use escaped from my grasp and fell unperceived on the floor his eye now lighted upon it he seized it with the quickness of thought  i shrieked aloud but it was too late he plunged it to the hilt in his neck and his life instantly escaped with the stream that gushed from the wound he was stretched at my feet and my hands were sprinkled with his blood as he fell  such was thy last deed my brother for a spectacle like this was it my fate to be reserved thy eyes were closed  thy face ghastly with death  thy arms and the spot where thou liedest floated in thy lifes blood these images have not for a moment forsaken me till i am breathless and cold they must continue to hover in my sight  carwin as i said had left the room but he still lingered in the house my voice summoned him to my aid but i scarcely noticed his reentrance and now faintly recollect his terrified looks his broken exclamations his vehement avowals of innocence the effusions of his pity for me and his offers of assistance  i did not listen  i answered him not  i ceased to upbraid or accuse his guilt was a point to which i was indifferent ruffian or devil black as hell or bright as angels thenceforth he was nothing to me i was incapable of sparing a look or a thought from the ruin that was spread at my feet  when he left me i was scarcely conscious of any variation in the scene he informed the inhabitants of the hut of what had passed and they flew to the spot careless of his own safety he hasted to the city to inform my friends of my condition  my uncle speedily arrived at the house the body of wieland was removed from my presence and they supposed that i would follow it but no my home is ascertained here i have taken up my rest and never will i go hence till like wieland i am borne to my grave  importunity was tried in vain they threatened to remove me by violence  nay violence was used but my soul prizes too dearly this little roof to endure to be bereaved of it force should not prevail when the hoary locks and supplicating tears of my uncle were ineffectual my repugnance to move gave birth to ferociousness and phrenzy when force was employed and they were obliged to consent to my return  they besought me  they remonstrated  they appealed to every duty that connected me with him that made me and with my fellowmen  in vain while i live i will not go hence have i not fulfilled my destiny  why will ye torment me with your reasonings and reproofs can ye restore to me the hope of my better days can ye give me back catharine and her babes can ye recall to life him who died at my feet  i will eat  i will drink  i will lie down and rise up at your bidding  all i ask is the choice of my abode what is there unreasonable in this demand shortly will i be at peace this is the spot which i have chosen in which to breathe my last sigh deny me not i beseech you so flight a boon  talk not to me o my revered friend of carwin he has told thee his tale and thou exculpatest him from all direct concern in the fate of wieland this scene of havoc was produced by an illusion of the senses be it so i care not from what source these disaster have flowed it suffices that they have swallowed up our hopes and our existence  what his agency began his agency conducted to a close he intended by the final effort of his power to rescue me and to banish his illusions from my brother such is his tale concerning the truth of which i care not henceforth i foster but one wish  i ask only quick deliverance from  and all the ills that attend it   go wretch torment me n with thy presence and thy prayers  forgive thee will that avail thee when thy fateful hour shall arrive be thou acquitted at thy own tribunal and thou need not fear the verdict of others if thy guilt be capable of blacker hues if hitherto thy conscience be without stain thy crime will be made more flagrant by thus violating my retreat take thyself away from my sight if thou would not behold my death  thou art gone murmuring and reluctant and now my repose is coming  my work is done  chapter xxvii written three years after the foregoing and dated at montpellier i imagined that i had forever laid aside the pen and that i should take up my abode in this part of the world was of all events the least probable my destiny i believed to be accomplished and i looked forward to a speedy termination of my life with the fullest confidence  surely i had reason to be weary of existence to be impatient of every tie which held me from the grave i experienced this impatience in its fullest extent i was not only enamoured of death but conceived from the condition of my frame that to shun it was impossible even though i had ardently desired it yet here am i a thousand leagues from my native soil in full possession of life and of health and not destitute of happiness  such is man time will obliterate the deepest impressions grief the most vehement and hopeless will gradually decay and wear itself out arguments may be employed in vain every moral prescription may be ineffectually tried remonstrances however cogent or pathetic shall have no power over the attention or shall be repelled with disdain yet as day follows day the turbulence of our emotions shall subside and our fluctuations be finally succeeded by a calm  perhaps however the conquest of despair was chiefly owing to an accident which rendered my continuance in my own house impossible at the conclusion of my long and as i then supposed my last letter to you i mentioned my resolution to wait for death in the very spot which had been the principal scene of my misfortunes from this resolution my friends exerted themselves with the utmost zeal and perseverance to make me depart they justly imagined that to be thus surrounded by memorials of the fate of my family would tend to foster my disease a swift succession of new objects and the exclusion of every thing calculated to remind me of my loss was the only method of cure  i refused to listen to their exhortations great as my calamity was to be torn from this asylum was regarded by me as an aggravation of it by a perverse constitution of mind he was considered as my greatest enemy who sought to withdraw me from a scene which supplied eternal food to my melancholy and kept my despair from languishing  in relating the history of these disasters i derived a similar species of gratification my uncle earnestly dissuaded me from this task but his remonstrances were as fruitless on this head as they had been on others they would have withheld from me the implements of writing but they quickly perceived that to withstand would be more injurious than to comply with my wishes having finished my tale it seemed as if the scene were closing a fever lurked in my veins and my strength was gone any exertion however slight was attended with difficulty and at length i refused to rise from my bed  i now see the infatuation and injustice of my conduct in its true colors i reflect upon the sensations and reasonings of that period with wonder and humiliation that i should be insensible to the claims and tears of my friends that i should overlook the suggestions of duty and fly from that post in which only i could be instrumental to the benefit of others that the exercise of the social and beneficent affections the contemplation of nature and the acquisition of wisdom should not be seen to be means of happiness still within my reach is at this time scarcely credible  it is true that i am now changed but i have not the consolation to reflect that my change was owing to my fortitude or to my capacity for instruction better thoughts grew up in my mind imperceptibly i cannot but congratulate myself on the change though perhaps it merely argues a fickleness of temper and a defect of sensibility  after my narrative was ended i betook myself to my bed in the full belief that my career in this world was on the point of finishing my uncle took up his abode with me and performed for me every office of nurse physician and friend one night after some hours of restlessness and pain i sunk into deep sleep its tranquillity however was of no long duration my fancy became suddenly distempered and my brain was turned into a theater of uproar and confusion it would not be easy to describe the wild and fantastical incongruities that pestered me my uncle wieland pleyel and carwin were successively and momently discerned amidst the storm sometimes i was swallowed up by whirlpools or caught up in the air by halfseen and gigantic forms and thrown upon pointed rocks or cast among the billows sometimes gleams of light were shot into a dark abyss on the verge of which i was standing and enabled me to discover for a moment its enormous depth and hideous precipices anon i was transported to some ridge of aetna and made a terrified spectator of its fiery torrents and its pillars of smoke  however strange it may seem i was conscious even during my dream of my real situation i knew myself to be asleep and struggled to break the spell by muscular exertions these did not avail and i continued to suffer these abortive creations till a loud voice at my bed side and some one shaking me with violence put an end to my reverie my eyes were unsealed and i started from my pillow  my chamber was filled with smoke which though in some degree luminous would permit me to see nothing and by which i was nearly suffocated the crackling of flames and the deafening clamor of voices without burst upon my ears stunned as i was by this hubbub scorched with heat and nearly choked by the accumulating vapors i was unable to think or act for my own preservation i was incapable indeed of comprehending my danger  i was caught up in an instant by a pair of sinewy arms borne to the window and carried down a ladder which had been placed there my uncle stood at the bottom and received me i was not fully aware of my situation till i found myself sheltered in the hut and surrounded by its inhabitants  by neglect of the servant some unextinguished embers had been placed in a barrel in the cellar of the building the barrel had caught fire this was communicated to the beams of the lower floor and thence to the upper part of the structure it was first discovered by some persons at a distance who hastened to the spot and alarmed my uncle and the servants the flames had already made considerable progress and my condition was overlooked till my escape was rendered nearly impossible  my danger being known and a ladder quickly procured one of the spectators ascended to my chamber and effected my deliverance in the manner before related  this incident disastrous as it may at first seem had in reality a beneficial effect upon my feelings i was in some degree roused from the stupor which had seized my faculties the monotonous and gloomy series of my thoughts was broken my habitation was levelled with the ground and i was obliged to seek a new one a new train of images disconnected with the fate of my family forced itself on my attention and a belief insensibly sprung up that tranquillity if not happiness was still within my reach notwithstanding the shocks which my frame had endured the anguish of my thoughts no sooner abated than i recovered my health  i now willingly listened to my uncles solicitations to be the companion of his voyage preparations were easily made and after a tedious passage we set our feet on the shore of the ancient world the memory of the past did not forsake me but the melancholy which it generated and the tears with which it filled my eyes were not unprofitable my curiosity was revived and i contemplated with ardour the spectacle of living manners and the monuments of past ages  in proportion as my heart was reinstated in the possession of its ancient tranquillity the sentiment which i had cherished with regard to pleyel returned in a short time he was united to the saxon woman and made his residence in the neighborhood of boston i was glad that circumstances would not permit an interview to take place between us i could not desire their misery but i reaped no pleasure from reflecting on their happiness time and the exertions of my fortitude cured me in some degree of this folly i continued to love him but my passion was diguised to myself i considered it merely as a more tender species of friendship and cherished it without compunction  through my uncles exertions a meeting was brought about between carwin and pleyel and explanations took place which restored me at once to the good opinion of the latter though separated so widely our correspondence was punctual and frequent and paved the way for that union which can only end with the death of one of us  in my letters to him i made no secret of my former sentiments this was a theme on which i could talk without painful though not without delicate emotions that knowledge which i should never have imparted to a lover i felt little scruple to communicate to a friend  a year and an half elapsed when theresa was snatched from him by death in the hour in which she gave him the first pledge of their mutual affection this event was borne by him with his customary fortitude it induced him however to make a change in his plans he disposed of his property in america and joined my uncle and me who had terminated the wanderings of two years at montpellier which will henceforth i believe be our permanent abode  if you reflect upon that entire confidence which had subsisted from our infancy between pleyel and myself on the passion that i had contracted and which was merely smothered for a time and on the esteem which was mutual you will not perhaps be surprised that the renovation of our intercourse should give birth to that union which at present subsists when the period had elapsed necessary to weaken the remembrance of theresa to whom he had been bound by ties more of honor than of love he tendered his affections to me i need not add that the tender was eagerly accepted  perhaps you are somewhat interested in the fate of carwin he saw when too late the danger of imposture so much affected was he by the catastrophe to which he was a witness that he laid aside all regard to his own safety he sought my uncle and confided to him the tale which he had just related to me he found a more impartial and indulgent auditor in mr cambridge who imputed to maniacal illusion the conduct of wieland though he conceived the previous and unseen agency of carwin to have indirectly but powerfully predisposed to this deplorable perversion of mind  it was easy for carwin to elude the persecutions of ludloe it was merely requisite to hide himself in a remote district of pennsylvania this when he parted from us he determined to do he is now probably engaged in the harmless pursuits of agriculture and may come to think without insupportable remorse on the evils to which his fatal talents have given birth the innocence and usefulness of his future life may in some degree atone for the miseries so rashly or so thoughtlessly inflicted  more urgent considerations hindered me from mentioning in the course of my former mournful recital any particulars respecting the unfortunate father of louisa conway that man surely was reserved to be a monument of capricious fortune his southern journies being finished he returned to philadelphia before he reached the city he left the highway and alighted at my brothers door contrary to his expectation no one came forth to welcome him or hail his approach he attempted to enter the house but bolted doors barred windows and a silence broken only by unanswered calls showed him that the mansion was deserted  he proceeded thence to my habitation which he found in like manner gloomy and tenantless his surprise may be easily conceived the rustics who occupied the hut told him an imperfect and incredible tale he hasted to the city and extorted from mrs baynton a full disclosure of late disasters  he was inured to adversity and recovered after no long time from the shocks produced by this disappointment of his darling scheme our intercourse did not terminate with his departure from america we have since met with him in france and light has at length been thrown upon the motives which occasioned the disappearance of his wife in the manner which i formerly related to you  i have dwelt upon the ardour of their conjugal attachment and mentioned that no suspicion had ever glanced upon her purity this though the belief was long cherished recent discoveries have shown to be questionable no doubt her integrity would have survived to the present moment if an extraordinary fate had not befallen her  major stuart had been engaged while in germany in a contest of honor with an aid de camp of the marquis of granby his adversary had propagated a rumor injurious to his character a challenge was sent a meeting ensued and stuart wounded and disarmed the calumniator the offense was atoned for and his life secured by suitable concessions  maxwell that was his name shortly after in consequence of succeeding to a rich inheritance sold his commission and returned to london his fortune was speedily augmented by an opulent marriage interest was his sole inducement to this marriage though the lady had been swayed by a credulous affection the true state of his heart was quickly discovered and a separation by mutual consent took place the lady withdrew to an estate in a distant county and maxwell continued to consume his time and fortune in the dissipation of the capital  maxwell though deceitful and sensual possessed great force of mind and specious accomplishments he contrived to mislead the generous mind of stuart and to regain the esteem which his misconduct for a time had forfeited he was recommended by her husband to the confidence of mrs stuart maxwell was stimulated by revenge and by a lawless passion to convert this confidence into a source of guilt  the education and capacity of this woman the worth of her husband the pledge of their alliance which time had produced her maturity in age and knowledge of the world  all combined to render this attempt hopeless maxwell however was not easily discouraged the most perfect being he believed must owe his exemption from vice to the absence of temptation the impulses of love are so subtle and the influence of false reasoning when enforced by eloquence and passion so unbounded that no human virtue is secure from degeneracy all arts being tried every temptation being summoned to his aid dissimulation being carried to its utmost bound maxwell at length nearly accomplished his purpose the ladys affections were withdrawn from her husband and transferred to him she could not as yet be reconciled to dishonor all efforts to induce her to elope with him were ineffectual she permitted herself to love and to avow her love but at this limit she stopped and was immovable  hence this revolution in her sentiments was productive only of despair her rectitude of principle preserved her from actual guilt but could not restore to her her ancient affection or save her from being the prey of remorseful and impracticable wishes her husbands absence produced a state of suspense this however approached to a period and she received tidings of his intended return maxwell being likewise apprized of this event and having made a last and unsuccessful effort to conquer her reluctance to accompany him in a journey to italy whither he pretended an invincible necessity of going left her to pursue the measures which despair might suggest at the same time she received a letter from the wife of maxwell unveiling the true character of this man and revealing facts which the artifices of her seducer had hitherto concealed from her mrs maxwell had been prompted to this disclosure by a knowledge of her husbands practices with which his own impetuosity had made her acquainted  this discovery joined to the delicacy of her scruples and the anguish of remorse induced her to abscond this scheme was adopted in haste but effected with consummate prudence she fled on the eve of her husbands arrival in the disguise of a boy and embarked at falmouth in a packet bound for america  the history of her disastrous intercourse with maxwell the motives inducing her to forsake her country and the measures she had taken to effect her design were related to mrs maxwell in reply to her communication between these women an ancient intimacy and considerable similitude of character subsisted this disclosure was accompanied with solemn injunctions of secrecy and these injunctions were for a long time faithfully observed  mrs maxwells abode was situated on the banks of the wey stuart was her kinsman their youth had been spent together and maxwell was in some degree indebted to the man whom he betrayed for his alliance with this unfortunate lady her esteem for the character of stuart had never been diminished a meeting between them was occasioned by a tour which the latter had undertaken in the year after his return from america to wales and the western counties this interview produced pleasure and regret in each their own transactions naturally became the topics of their conversation and the untimely fate of his wife and daughter were related by the guest  mrs maxwells regard for her friend as well as for the safety of her husband persuaded her to concealment but the former being dead and the latter being out of the kingdom she ventured to produce mrs stuarts letter and to communicate her own knowledge of the treachery of maxwell she had previously extorted from her guest a promise not to pursue any scheme of vengeance but this promise was made while ignorant of the full extent of maxwells depravity and his passion refused to adhere to it  at this time my uncle and i resided at avignon among the english resident there and with whom we maintained a social intercourse was maxwell this mans talents and address rendered him a favorite both with my uncle and myself he had even tendered me his hand in marriage but this being refused he had sought and obtained permission to continue with us the intercourse of friendship since a legal marriage was impossible no doubt his views were flagitious whether he had relinquished these views i was unable to judge  he was one in a large circle at a villa in the environs to which i had likewise been invited when stuart abruptly entered the apartment he was recognized with genuine satisfaction by me and with seeming pleasure by maxwell in a short time some affair of moment being pleaded which required an immediate and exclusive interview maxwell and he withdrew together stuart and my uncle had been known to each other in the german army and the purpose contemplated by the former in this long and hasty journey was confided to his old friend  a defiance was given and received and the banks of a rivulet about a league from the city was selected as the scene of this contest my uncle having exerted himself in vain to prevent an hostile meeting consented to attend them as a surgeon  next morning at sunrise was the time chen  i returned early in the evening to my lodgings preliminaries being settled between the combatants stuart had consented to spend the evening with us and did not retire till late on the way to his hotel he was exposed to no molestation but just as he stepped within the portico a swarthy and malignant figure started from behind a column and plunged a stiletto into his body  the author of this treason could not certainly be discovered but the details communicated by stuart respecting the history of maxwell naturally pointed him out as an object of suspicion no one expressed more concern on account of this disaster than he and he pretended an ardent zeal to vindicate his character from the aspersions that were cast upon it thenceforth however i denied myself to his visits and shortly after he disappeared from this scene  few possessed more estimable qualities and a better title to happiness and the tranquil honors of long life than the mother and father of louisa conway yet they were cut off in the bloom of their days and their destiny was thus accomplished by the same hand maxwell was the instrument of their destruction though the instrument was applied to this end in so different a manner  i leave you to moralize on this tale that virtue should become the victim of treachery is no doubt a mournful consideration but it will not escape your notice that the evils of which carwin and maxwell were the authors owed their existence to the errors of the sufferers all efforts would have been ineffectual to subvert the happiness or shorten the existence of the stuarts if their own frailty had not seconded these efforts if the lady had crushed her disastrous passion in the bud and driven the seducer from her presence when the tendency of his artifices was seen if stuart had not admitted the spirit of absurd revenge we should not have had to deplore this catastrophe if wieland had framed juster notions of moral duty and of the divine attributes or if i had been gifted with ordinary equanimity or foresight the doubletongued deceiver would have been baffled and repelled
