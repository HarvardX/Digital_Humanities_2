address and declaration of the friends of universal peace and liberty held at the thatched house tavern st jamess street august  0th       by thomas pain author of the works entitled common sense and the rights of man  together with some verses by the same author which were printed in a pensylvanian newspaper  price two pence   second part of rights of man address and declaration friends and fellow citizens at a moment like the present when wilful misrepresentations are industriously spread by the partisans of arary power and the advocates of passive obedience and courtgvernment we think it incumbent upon us to declare to the world our principles and the motives of our conduct  we rejoice at the glorious event of the french revoltion  if it be asked  what is the french revolution to us  we answer as has been already answered in another place  of the volteers of beat  it it much  much to us as men much to us as englishmen  as men we rejoice in the freedom of twenty five millions of our fellow mn we rejoice in the prospect which such a magnificent example opens to the world we congratulate the french nation for having laid the axe to the root of tyranny and for erecting government on the sacred hereditary rights of man  rights which appertain to all and not to a yoe more than to another we know of o human authority superior to that of a whole nation and we profess and proclaim it as our principle that every nation has at all times an inherent indefeasible right to constitute and establish such government for itself as best accords with its disposition interest and happiness  as englishmen we also rejoice because we are immediately interested in the french revolution  without enquiring into the justice on either side of the reproachful charges of intrigue and ambition which the english and french court have constantly made on each other we confine ourselves to this observation  that if the court of france only was in fault and the numerous wars which have distresed both countries are chargeable to her alone that court now exists no longer and the cause and the consequence must cease together the french therefore by the revolution they have made have conquered for us as well as for themselves if it be true that their court only was in fault and ours never  on this state of the case the french revolution concerns us immediately we are oppressed with a heavy national debt a burden of taxes and an expensive administration of government beyond those of any people in the world we have also a very numerous poor and we hold that the moral obligation of providing for old age helpless infancy and poverty is far superior to that of supplying the invented wants of courtly extravagance ambition and intrigue  we believe there is no instance to be produced but in england of seven millions of inhabitants which make but little more than one million of families paying yearly seventeen milions of taxes  as it has always been held out by all administrations that the restless ambition of the court of france rendered this expense necessary to us for our own defense we consequently rejoice as men deeply interested in the french revolution for that cour as we have already said exists no longer and consequently the same enormous expenses need not continue to us  thus rejoicing as we sincerely do both as men and englishmen as lovers of universal peace and freedom and as friends to our own national prosperity and a reduction of our public expenses we cannot but express our astonishment that any part or any members of our own government should reprobate the extinction of that very power in france or wish to see it restored to whose influence they formerly attributed whilst they appeared to lament the enormous increase of our own burdens and taxes what then are they sorry that the pretense for new oppressive taxes and the occasion for continuing many old taxes will be at an end  if so and if it is the policy of courts and court government to prefer enemies to friends and a system of war to that of peace as affording more pretenses for places offices pensions revenue and taxation it is high time for the people of every nation to look with circumspection to their own interest  those who pay the expense and not those who participate in the emoluments arising from it are the persons immediately interested in enquiries of this kind we are a part of that national body on whom this annual expense of seventeen millions falls and we consider the present opportunity of the french revolution as a most happy one for lessening the enormous load under which this nation groans if this be not done we shall then have reason to conclude that the cry of intrigue and ambition against other courts is no more than the common cant of all courts  we think it also necessary to express our astonishment that a government desirous of being called free should prefer connexions with the most despotic and arbitary powers in europe we know of none more deserving this description than those of turkey and prussia and the whole combination of german despots  separated as we happily are by nature from the tumults of the continent we reprobate all systems and intrigues which sacrifice and that too at a great expense the blessings of our natural situation  such systoms cannot have a national origin  if we are asked what government is  we hold it to be nothing more than a national association and we hold that to be the best which secures to every man his rights and promotes the greatest quantity of happiness with the least expense  we live to improve or we live in vain and therefore we admit of no maxims of government or policy on the mere score of antiquity or other mens authority the old whigs or the new  we will exercise the reason with which we are endued or we possess it unworthily as reason is given at all times it is for the purpose of being used at all times  among the blessings which the french revolution has produced to that nation we enumerate the abolition of the feudal system of injustice and tyranny on the  th of august      beneath the feudal system all europe has long groaned and from it england is not yet free gamelaws boroughtenures and tyrannical monopolies of numerous kinds still remain amongst us but rejoicing as we sincerely do in the freedom of others till we shall happily accomplish our own we intended to commemorate this prelude to the universal extirpation of the feudal system by meeting on the anniversary of that day the  th of august at the crown and anchor from this meeting we were prevented by the interference of certain unnamed and sculking persons with the master of the tavern who informed us that on their representations he could not receive us  let those who live by or countenance feudal oppressions take the reproach of this ineffectual meanness and cowardice to themselves they cannot stifle the public declaration of our honest open and avowed opinions  these are our principles and these our sentiments they embrace the interest and happiness of the great body of the nation of which we are a part as to riots and tumults let those answer for them who by wilful misrepresentations endeavur to excite and promote them or who seek to stun the sense of the nation and lose the great cause of public good in the outrages of a misinformed mob we take our ground on principles that require no such riotous aid we have nothing to apprehend from the poor for we are pleading their cause and we fear not proud oppression for we have truth on our side  we say and we repeat it that the french revolution opens to the world an opportunity in which all good citizens must rejoice that of promoting the general happiness of man and that it moreover offers to this country in particular an opportunity of reducing our enormous taxes  these are our objects and we will pursue them  john h tk chaman  lines etc by thomas pain the rain pours down the city looks forlorn and gloomy subjects suit the howling morn close by my e with door and window fast and safely sheltered from the driving blast to gayer thoughts i bid a days adieu to spend a scene of solitude with you so often has black revenge engrosd the care of all the leisure hours man finds to spare so often has guilt in all her thousand dens called for the vengeance of chastising pens that while i fain would case my heart on you no thought is left untold no passion new from flight to flight the mental path appears worn with the steps of near six thousand years and filled throughout with every scene of pain from cain to g and back from g to cain alike in cruelty alike in hate in guilt alike but more alike in fate both cursed supremely for the blood they drew each from the rising world while each was new go second cain true likeness of the first and strew thy blasted head with homely dust in ashes sit  in wretched sackcloth weep and with unpitied sorrows cease t lee go haunt the tombs and single out the place where earth itself shall suffer a disgrace go spell the letters on some mouldring urn and ask if he who sleeps there can return go count the numbers that in silence lie and learn by study what it is to die for sure that heart  if any heart you own conceits that man expires without a groan that he who lives receives from you a grace or death is nothing but a change of place that peace is dl that y from sorrow springs and war the royal ra show of things else wh these scenes that wound the feeling mind this sport of death  this cockpit of mankind why sobs the widow in perpetual pain why cries the orphan  oh my fathers slain why hangs the sire his paralytic head and nods with manly grief  my son is dead why drops the tears from off the sisters cheek and sweetly tells the sorrows she would speak or why in lonely steps does pensive john to all the neighbors tell poor masters gone oh could i paint the passion i can feel or point a horror that would wound like steel to thy unfeeling unrelenting mind i would send a torture and relieve mankind thou that art husband father brother all the tender names which kindred learn to call yet like an image carved in massey stone th bear the shape but sentiment hast none alied by dust and figure not by mind thou only herdst but livst not with mankind and prone to love like some outrageous ape thou know each class of beings by their shape since then no hopes to civilize remain and all petitions have gone forth in vain one prayer is left which dreads no proud reply that he who made thee breath will make thee die common sense
