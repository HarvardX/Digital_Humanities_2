that debt because thou desiredst me should not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servants even as i had pity on thee  matt xviii v       when we seriously consider the frail corrupt and distrustful state of human nature when we reflect on the general lot and portion of mortality when we call to mind how few things there are in this life which can impart real and substantial happiness and on the other hand how many are pregnant with misery and sorrow we are naturally led to imagine that it must be the business as it is the interest and concern of every individual to lighten as much as possible the general burden that every office of tenderness and humanity to our fellow creatures would of course be duly and punctually performed by every one of us wellknowing that all the poor aid and assistance which each particular could lend would still afford but small and insignificant preservatives against universal affliction and calamity as the most that we can do is but to soften that distress which we cannot prevent and to sooth those sorrows which we cannot remove  and yet the general conduct and behavior of mankind is directly contrary it is indeed a melancholy truth that for the most part we employ our wit and sagacity but to over reach our ingenuity to torment our riches and power to persecute and oppress each other  in the parable now before us our blessed savior who applied it solely to the purpose of inculcating mutual love charity and forgiveness informs us that the benevolent king had generously on the humble petition of the poor insolvent withdrawn his just claim to the whole debt which was no less than ten thousand talents and yet this very servant would not afterward forgive his fellow servants one hundred pence though most earnestly solicited by him but cast him into prison then it was says our savior that his lord called him and said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me should not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servants even as i had pity on thee the consequence of this cruel and inhuman treatment of his unhappy brother was such we are told as the offender well deserved his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him the behavior of the kings servant on this occasion as related by our blessed savior was not we have reason to suppose recorded by him as any thing singular or remarkable but as a circumstance that had frequently happened in times past and probably would but too often happen also in times to come he well knew and foresaw that the same unforgiving temper and disposition the same rancorous malevolence and inhumanity which had actuated the mind of one man might afterward corrupt the breasts and influence the conduct of thousands and of this there have been but too many evident proofs in every age and nation from the days of our savior and his apostles even unto our own  for the honor of that nature which we partake of for the interest and advancement of that virtue which we admire and that holy religion which we profess most seriously and devoutly it were to be wished that some method could be found out effectually to preserve and secure the property of individuals without sacrificing the liberty of one man to the arbitrary will or caprice the anger and resentment the oppression and insensibility of another but human laws must partake of human imperfections even in the most polished and refined nations for the grievance is by no means confined to our own punishments are often inflicted which are very inadequate to the crimes committed and this is doubtless a hardship more particularly to be lamented with regard to the insolvent debtor  the cruel confinement of a loathsome dungeon with all the horrors generally attendant on it is doubtless by far too severe a sentence on the unhappy delinquent to be cut off at once from all the comforts and conveniences of life to be separated perhaps by brutal force and violence from all that he holds dear to be deprived of light and air the common benefits of nature is surely a dreadful and melancholy transition even when his incapacity of discharging the debt is the consequence of imprudence solly and extravagance how much more pitiable is his condition when it springs from unavoidable poverty and misfortune from a total inability of providing for the exigencies of nature and the necessities of human life perhaps even sometimes and it is a circumstance not uncommon from the baseness fraud or imposture of those with whom he is connected who take advantage of his easy nature to delude and impose upon him how many have been immured for their whole lives in a prison from their imprudent readiness and alacrity in serving those whom they most loved and esteemed by becoming surities for their friends and relations how many have procured the peace happiness and liberty of others at the dear expense of their own  when we add to this what must frequently be the case that the unhappy sufferer is burdened with a numerous and helpless family that the tree which is thus blasted is at the same time bent down with the weight of its own branches when the innocent are thus inevitably involved in the same punishment with the guilty when at the very crisis that the wretched parent would most wish for the power to assist his children he is deprived of every means to support them when the fountain of industry that only source from whence the waters of comfort could flow is dried up in a barren wilderness how does the melancholy scene swell with complicated misery in this dreadful situation he is left delivered over as the kings servant was to the tormentors confined perhaps within the same walls fed with the same scanty pittance and doomed to the same ignominous treatment as the ruffian the felon and the murderer their fate indeed is more eligible than his guilt alone excepted their confinement is short and determined and death is ready like a kind friend to finish their days and their miseries together whilst the unhappy debtor who languishes for years in a dark and dreary dungeon dies a lingering death and drags on a wretched being in lengthened shame and protracted misery  when indeed we consider the variety of evils arising to individuals as well as the many inconveniences felt by the community from this single circumstance we are utterly at a loss to account for the small degree of attention which has hitherto been paid to it more especially when we call to mind that there is scarce any species of distress which the benevolence of this charitable age and nation has not already endeavored to relinquish or remove we cannot but wonder that amidst all the complaints brought to the ears of the great the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners did not sooner come before them that where there are so many good samaritans these wounds were not bound up and healed the only probable cause to be assigned perhaps is that what we ourselves do neither see nor feel is seldom the object of our enquiry or consideration the cries of poverty are every day heard bodily pains and diseases accidents and misfortunes of various kinds are frequently seen and sometimes experienced by persons of the highest rank and fortune these therefore the hand of charity has been stretched forth to soften and relieve but few very few amongst the rich and great have followed the unhappy debtor into his captivity or visited those mansions of grief and sorrow which he is doomed to inhabit the evil which was not generally known could not be generally attended to nor could it be expected that the afflictions and calamities which were not seen could be so speedily or so effectually removed  the time however is at length come thanks to the great inspirer of every good word and work when the groans of the oppressed captive have reached the ears of the merciful and pierced the hearts of the benevolent to take away that reproach of carelessness and inattention which i just now mentioned to counteract the malevolence of some the hardness of heart and insensibility of others to free the captive and save the wretched for these noble and truly glorious purposes was framed that humane and truly excellent institution which we this day meet to encourage and support a laudable and generous design which calls for our warmest zeal to recommend and merits our heartiest endeavors toward the furtherance and improvement of it  already has this our age and nation been sufficiently distinguished by its numerous acts of goodness and beneficence as the many schools hospitals and foundations in it do most abundantly testify there wanted as it were but this one wing to finish and complete the great temple of charity that superb and magnificent structure which will immortalize our name and transmit british compassion and humanity to the admiration of future ages with regard to the particular institution i am here to recommend whether we consider the benefits resulting from this charity to individuals or the advantages that will arise to society whether we consider it as dispensing private happiness or promoting public utility a more truly pious and useful work the good the benevolent and the charitable could never be engaged in  the distinguishing characteristic of this excellent plan and which seems to gild it with a superior luster is that it is at once an act both of justice and of mercy whilst it imparts its welcome bounties to the unfortunate debtor it satisfies the legal claims of the creditor also whilst the light strikes upon and is directed to one object the reflection as it were illuminates another it not only as common flowers in the garden of charity delights the sense by the grateful odor peculiar to it but like the perfumes of the east diffuses sweetness and fragrance on every side of it not only does the unhappy prisoner recover his freedom when assisted by us but whenever it happens as it frequently does that on a strict and careful investigation of every circumstance the creditor is himself found to be in an indigent and distressful condition the whole debt is generously discharged thus the relief of one is made subservient to the happiness of both and the blessing is doubled by the mutual participation of it  but moreover whilst this excellent charity is so instrumental to private relief it isno less subservient to the public welfare the want of hands in every branch of commerce and manufacture is every day felt and lamented by us and yet we suffer numbers of the most able and vigorous to waste away their youth and strength in a prison where like withered boughs they are hewed down as it were and cast into the fire how meritorious then how praiseworthy is that benevolence which reflores these useful members to society which enables them once more to exert their powers and abilities in their several callings and professions and to become profitable servants of that community to which they belong when thus we cast our bread upon the waters after not many days it returns unto us  in opposition to this humane and benevolent institution and where is that good work which has not met with opposition it has been suggested by some that it may afford encouragement to the idle and unprincipled to contract such debts as will thus kindly be discharged for them that the relief thus constantly administered will diminish the apprehensions and lessen the terrors of a prison and consequently render men more careless of their behavior that it even lays itself open to fraud and collusion between the vicious and immoral and that debtor and creditor may connive together to share the advantages resulting from these charitable donations but these are false weak and illgrounded suggestions which every days experience since the institution of this charity has enabled us to gainsay and confute it is impossible perhaps for human wisdom to guard against all the arts which may be practiced by the cunning and deceitful to counteract its benevolent purposes every caution however i will venture to assert has been made use of to prevent fraud and imposture and in the relief of objects the strictest attention always paid and the fullest bounty always bestowed on those who were most deserving of it it is very easy for men of affluent fortunes who never felt the griping hand of penury to boast of their punctual and regular discharge of every just and legal demand upon them and no less easy is it for such as is too often the case to deal forth liberal invectives against the wretched insolvent who is deficient in that duty which they have so constantly performed but little alas do they consider what the ruthless command of that tyrant necessity might have obliged them to little do they reflect how hard the struggle may sometimes prove in the honest and conscientious mind between the powerful plea of pressing indigence and the stinging reproaches of forfeited justice and integrity  on the most strict and candid examination into the merits of those who are entitled to the assistance of this charity it must be acknowledged to the honor of human nature that amongst all the miserable objects confined in the walls of a prison many are indebted for their wretched situation there to unavoidable misfortune many to venial errors folly and imprudence many most of them indeed to the cruel and unfeeling disposition of their merciless creditors but few very few to what is too often ascribed as the cause of it a total want of principle and common honesty this height of depravity and corruption to say the truth is generally the portion of those who figure in higher life of those who though they have never been condemned to suffer the miseries of a prison have notwithstanding most amply deserved it  our laws we know have been said and there is perhaps but too much truth in the comparison to resemble those nets or toils which entangle the smaller beasts of prey but are at the same time too weak and feeble to hold fast the strong and powerful which are driven into them how else indeed could it happen that the poor destitute and friendless insolvent debtor is torn to pieces by the cruel fangs of justice that he suffers all the rigor which an unrelenting creditor can inflict upon him for a small and inconsiderable debt whilst the insolent and fraudful bankrupt who has ruined thousands shall stalk in open daylight untouched and unabashd laugh at his oppressed helpless creditors and bid defiance to law justice and humanity  but let us leave these infamous plunderers to what is worse than prisons or death the reproaches of their own conscience to those tormentors let us deliver them and turn our eyes toward objects far more deserving of our attention toward the meek and humble the sober and the diffident the wretched and the oppressed who stretch out their hands to us for succor and pray unto us for light and liberty those alas who are possessed of this glorious treasure seem as it were insensible of its worth and the true value of this as of almost every other blessing is seldom known till we feel the want of it it is scarce credible my brethren to how many in so short a time we have already by means of this excellent institution been able to dispense this great and noble gift but true charity like true beauty to be admired need but to be seen the closer it is examined and with the nicer scrutiny it is enquired into the more lovers and followers will it always attract it will not surprise you therefore but it will give you infinite pleasure to hear that within the short space of twelve months last past upwards of twelve thousand pounds has already been paid or compounded for from the benefactions of this society whole families rescued from want misery and despeir and a number of useful and industrious members restored to the community must it not my brethren expand your hearts with benevolent cheerfulness to reflect that you have spread joy and happiness over the minds of so many of your fellow creatures are you not thus amply repaid for all the trouble of your solicitous enquiries for all the expense of your collections and all your labor in the distribution of them  the power of life and death is doubtless a truly great and noble and therefore a royal prerogative and yours my brethren who contribute to this charity deserves the next place in honor and dignity to dispense the greatest blessing of this life to our fellowcreatures is almost as distinguishing a privilege as to prolong life itself which indeed without this is scarce worthy of our acceptance by contributing to this excellent charity by taking upon you my brethren this kind this benevolent this pious office you resemble a superior order of beings you resemble in the noblest of their perfections those ministers of the almighty the holy angels of god who came to deliver his chosen apostle from captivity as soon as you enter into the gloomy regions of slavery the darkness gradually recedeth from them the light shines in the prison the iron doors open of their own accord and you say to the wretched and despairing captive who looks with wonder and astonishment upon you as the angel did unto peter gird thyself and bind on thy sandals cast thy garment about thee and follow us  upon the whole then in whatever light we view this amiable institution which ever side of the building we turn toward as it strikes us with fresh pleasure and rises upon uswith redoubled luster shall we not endeavor then to rest it on a firm and solid foundation many miserable and distressful objects have already been relieved but more many more are every day and every hour appealing to our compassion and soliciting our bounty shall we not listen to the cries of the poor and hear the voice of the appressed  let us then my brethren like the nil actum reputans si quid superesset agendum roman conqueror of old think nothing yet done whilst any thing remains undone any thing at least which it is in our power to perform those who are blessed with affluence health and prosperity are bound by every tie of gratitude to consider the wants and sorrows of the sick and needy and those who enjoy the blessings of ease and freedom should look with an eye of tenderness and compassion on the pains and miseries of captivity  consider then my brethren i beseech you the wretched condition of the unfortunate debtor more particularly my beloved consider and reflect upon it at this this sermon was preached when the weather was remarkably fine genial fertile and benignant season when every ray of light diffuseth joy and gladness when every gale is impregnated with health and pleasure at such a time shall we not cast a thought toward the poor confined prisoner shut up from that refreshing air which we breath and deprived of that reviving light which we rejoice in shall we not willingly abridge ourselves of any little superfluous sensual gratification to promote a fellowcreatures freedom to communicate that pleasure which we possess to impart that happiness which we ourselves enjoy  this my brethren is as it were the last the youngest offspring of british charity let us treat it as a darling favorite nourish it with more than ordinary tenderness and foster it with peculiar care if from the amazing growth and improvement of its infant state we may judge of its future size and perfection it will rise to a noble height when arrived at its maturity  hereafter we trust and may the observation be prophetic it will rise in stature and grow in favor with god and man this little rivulet shall one day swell into a wide and copious stream that shall diffuse plenty and prosperity on every side of it it shall abound like euphrates and like jordan in the time of harvest this grain of mustardseed to conclude with the image made use of by our blessed savior himself which at present indeed is the least of all seeds shall one day be the greatest among herbs and become a tree so that the birds of the air shall come and lodge in the branches thereof  which god of his infinite mercy grant to whom etc  finis debtor the general state of the account for the discharge and relief of persons imprisoned for small debts from
