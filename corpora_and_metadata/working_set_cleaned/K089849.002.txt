periodical essays that every subject is preoccupied that the spectator the tatler and the guardian have cultivated every field of reflection and that there remains nothing at present to be gleaned by successive adventurers though i have all the respect due to the memory of the excellent writers of the performances just mentioned i am far from paying them a blind adoration on the contrary amidst all that surprising emanation of genius wit and humor which distinguishes many of their writings i can sometimes descry a subject carelessly treated without any of their usual turns of sentiment or beauties of diction i have now and then gone through a series of important trifles and i have occasionally found them vague upon subjects of criticism indeterminate in their expressions and loose in their definitions if this happens to be the case would it not be an erroneous proceeding to suppress every other attempt because sir richard steel planned so many years before nay even if they were free from any of those blemishes which arise either from inadvertence or the imbecility of human nature would it not be absurd to extinguish the seeds of laudable emulation had the rigor of this sentence been carried into execution the world would never have been favored with the admirable performances of the author of the rambler that the english language has received from this writer many additional ornaments it is i believe universally felt by all men of taste every topic is by him treated with great erudition and strong sense enlivened with all the glowing colorings of a warm imagination and the whole carried on with a nervous clear and harmonious style if the performance in general has not the variety of the spectator it is because mr johnson wrote singly and alone whereas the former was supported by several of eminent abilities and therefore in the present age there seems nothing wanting but a coalition of men of parts to equal our predecessors in all manner of periodical writings  certain it is there are many topics in every branch of science and in all the liberal arts which may still receive new lights and conduce both to the entertainment and instruction of the public since mr addisons time a du bos has shone forth in france and a spence in england and the late ingenious editor of a translation of virgil is a convincing proof that rules for fine writing and precepts of critical knowledge may be still enforced with great elegance and propriety though the essays on miltons paradise lost and on the pleasures of imagination must be allowed to have all the masterly strokes that can result from a delicate and refined taste the regions of reflection are like a champain country in which different objects present themselves in various attitudes to the eye and the imagination is frequently caught by parts of the prospect which have escaped anothers observation each person receiving different sensations according as the fancy is disposed for the sublime the wonderful or the beautiful in the natural world  besides the continual fluctuation of fashions customs and manners must always afford fresh matter for the satyrist of wit and humor the tree of folly is like the tree mentioned by the author of my motto though many have plucked a branch from it it is always quickly replaced by another and the new growth shoots into daylight with undiminished fertility  are there those who are pleased to indulge a delicate vein of raillery on the foibles and piccadillos of the fair never was there more ample room to display a turn of wit in this way than what the present times are so happy as to afford the hoop has of late swelled to a wider circumference than ever and by the help of a few formidable rows of steel threatens mischief to the whole circle of beaux who cannot now approach the ladies in their entrenchments without manifest danger of fracturing a shinbone hurting the pan of the knee or some such disaster while this fashion prevails the ladies may be charged with carrying concealed arms and making use of masked barteries for which by the way they have no manner of occasion as they seem at present to be in possession of more courage than any amazon mentioned in history for whereas those viragos used to encounter with only one breast exerted the modern ladies are not afraid of meeting the men with both quite naked and displayed to view the head is also built up many stories higher than it used to be and the art of painting is now arrived to such perfection that it is absolutely impossible to know a female acquaintance for any length of time each lovely fair having as many faces and complexions as gloves fans or tippets add to this that you may meet a lady today with an elegant shape fine by degrees and delicately less and tomorrow she will appear as big round the waist as if within a few days of her time besides this cribbidge has suppressed the reign of love and cupid minds nothing now but cogging the dice or procuring a pairroyal at brag and indeed the present happy disposition for luxury and every vice folly whim foible humor and extravagance seems to promise a very plentiful crop every year so that after a survey of this metropolis we may say with mr addison in his prologue to the tender husband here is still encouragement for those that write  on this account though i have now felt the anxiety of a writer for twelve months past i have resolved with myself not to lay down my pen until i am warned to do it by the lassitude of an author or what is worse the lassitude of the reader at present however i do not find any symptoms of this sort in my own breast nor can i learn that my paper declines with my readers in my rambles since last saturday i did not meet with any thing that made against me at sams mr wood informed me that his customers hope i am not going to leave off trade a stationer at the chapter coffeehouse in st pauls churchyard called with some earnestness for the graysinn journal and having possession of it he moistened a corner of it with the tip of his tongue and then holding it up to the light really says he its a very good paper at most

casually overheard that i am as striking a character as ever hush  that is he  that is ranger  was you ever in company with him  no  i should like to spend an evening with him etc  in the softer climate of st jamess air i was told that my bays are likely to flourish and i was particularly assured by a gentleman who frequents the cocoa tree in pallmall that ranger has gained admittance there notwithstanding their attachment to the adventorer  things standing thus i am determined to persevere in my undertaking and i therefore take this opportunity to renew my application to all the

am informed by a very sensible bookseller that an r in the month is not only good for oysters but also writers of all denominations the season is now opening when all the vices and follies of this metropolis will be carried on with fresh alacrity which will undoubtedly afford variety of intelligence from all quarters to collect which i shall not spare either trouble or expense though it must be allowed that a onehorse chaise during the summerseason and twopence to be paid at the bar of every coffeehouse must in the end amount to a considerable sum but this i shall pay very willingly and i shall now begin to visit the several academies of which i have formerly given an account my man tom is somewhat like his namesake in the conscious lovers and is perfectly acquainted with every phillis in london so that i cannot fail through this channel of receiving the cariest account of all occurrences among the ladies such as who keeps most card tables who plays deepest at whist who cheats with the best grace who has the best wash for the complexion who has the handsomest chair and many other points of equal moment a notable speaker at the robinhood society is to transmit me all the discourses upon religion and as to politics the talkativeness of my barber while he is dabbing his fist about my face and pulling my nose into a thousand different shapes will abundantly qualify me in that branch and by these means i flatter myself i shall greatly excel all my brother annalists and historiographers whether they appear in daily papers or magazines  covent garden theater the tragedy of romeo and juliet was performed here on the th instant romeo by mr barry and juliet by miss nossiter being her first appearance upon any stage at her first entrance the delicacy of her figure an her graceful distress obtained for her the warmest applause and as she grew more animated in the progress she frequently surprised the house with the most alarming attitudes the faultering of her resolution when going to drink the composing draught was finely marked the fixure of her eyes and feebleness of her whole person when coming forward from the tomb and her manner of holding her lovers dead body and looking at the friar when she cries out you shall not tear him from me were all happily imagined and to crown the whole her action at stabbing herself was a very fine and affecting circumstance after this it may not be improper to observe that a fondness for attitudes may carry a performer to an extreme as perhaps was the case in her standing with an uplifted arm in act to strike when she says as with a club dash out their brains because that position denotes an intent to knock down another be that as it may if this young actress studies the management of her voice and attains a more simple elocution she must prove an acquisition to the stage  numb    graysinn saturday oct         scimus inurbanum lepido seponere dicto hor i have in a former paper delivered my sentiments concerning the notable art of humbugging i shall this day throw together some cursory reflections upon the practice of raillery which in my opinion it is the interest of society to explode from every company  i am induced into this way of thinking from an observation that few people are properly qualified to exercise this talent there being hardly any thing which requires so fine an understanding together with so much delicacy in the exertion of it but as matters are generally managed there is nothing so coarse as the attempts of those who are ambitious of shining in conversation and are therefore determined to banter mankind into an exalted opinion of their accomplishments the utmost that can be allowed to these gentlemen is to join in the general laugh and if mirth should be going forward they may very properly be admitted to partake of the frolic festivity without vainly pretending to take the lead or to engross the conversation into their own hands in like manner as the uninformed country squire should not be suffered by the master of the ceremonies in a polite assembly to come forward in a minuet where the graces of movement are required though he may be tolerated to romp in a country dance and display all the gambols of his unfashioned agility  nec cum sis caetera fossor tres tantum ad numeros satyri moveare bathylli were i to define raillery i should call it a delicate exertion of pleasantry upon the foibles or the slight inadvertences which disclose themselves in the actions of men from this view of matters it will appear that no tincture of ill nature must be suffered to disfigure the surface that only slight errors must be the ground on which the coloring is laid and that good manners must give a polish to the whole no man has any degree of right to invade anothers inward peace and therefore a well turned mind will always decline any thing that comes home to the bosom of any person with whom he is willing to enter into society whatever may tend to create disesteem in the circle of our acquaintance or to throw a ridiculous light upon a character whatever may excite uneasy sensations by touching upon circumstances about which it is possible a person may have a tender feeling though in their own nature they are not of any material importance in short all topics but such as we are convinced the the object of our merriment will give up are carefully to be avoided and it will be always highly necessary so to glide gently over the affected part that the wound may appear to be probed by a skilful hand i have somewhere read a story of jack ketchs wife which i think throws a light on this matter any body says that elegant lady can tuck a man up and stop his breath but to do it with dexterity and make the culprit die an easy pleasant death is only the genteel qualification of my husband thus it requires no very shining abilities to inform our neighbor of his oddities and point out to him his slight indiscretions but to open his eyes and let in the light without rendering it painful to him to give a sense of the foible without disturbing the natural complacence with which every one is willing to behold himself is a task which requires more elegance and refinement than happens to fall to the share of every individual and yet there is no going any where without meeting pretenders in this way every quarter of the town abounds with men of raillery and to all these it is necessary to render an account of our actions our friends our attachments our clothes our walk and what not to all these notable personages i would beg leave to recommend the following story a gentleman was one day shaving himself in his parlour to the great admiration of otho his monkey who stood by him wonderfully pleased with the turn of his wrist and the dexterity of every stroke the operation being finished and the gentleman gone out without laying up his utensils otho mounts the table fixes himself before the glass and flourishes the razor with mimic skill till unfortunately he cut his jaw across and then too late found the danger of playing with edge tools  i have drawn up an allegorical account of the birth and parentage of raillery which i think may serve to lay before the reader its several efficient qualities  goodsense and ridicule were joined in wedlock the offspring of their marriage was humor who for a long time roved about parnassus placing the follies and whims of mankind in such a light as never failed to excite mirth in the synod of apollo and the muses at length happening to wander out of bounds humor met upon the borders of parnassus just upon the verge of worldly commerce a certain lady known by the name of ill nature drawn in by false allurements and a glavering smile which ill nature always wore upon her countenance humor offered proposals of marriage which were carried without delay into execution and in nine months time railing was ushered into the world with a small mixture in his composition of his fathers qualities strongly blended with the complexional habits of his mother railing grew up in the practice of exposing the infirmities of all who came in his way without restraint he took unbecoming liberties with private families sowed the seeds of discontent in every breast and in time began to disturb the harmony of the sacred nine whereupon thalia conceived an aversion to him and in order to mend the breed preferred a petition to apollo to divorce humor from his wife illnature  after a full hearing of the cause apollo issued out his edict of separation humor could not live single and in a short time made another match which as good luck would have it turned out better than the former his second wifes name was wit a lady of great vivacity and abounding in surprising turns in all her conversation she hardly could see any thing but her way was instantly to compare it to some other object in nature and she frequently would make her auditors laugh by pointing out a latent resemblance in things which seemed in their own natures absolutely repugnant to each other her principal attention was to set off her husband and though she was fond of great variety in her dress she would upon many occasions lend her best apparel to humor who never failed to look most engaging when wit contributed her ornaments humor in his turn gave supernumerary embellishments to his wife and they both reflected a reciprocal luster upon each other they continued in a state of mutual fondness and their faithful love was in time rewarded with a tender daughter who was immediately called with the general consent by the name of railery the muses cherished her in their bosoms and as she grew up she discovered a propensity to her fathers way of thinking but with a considerable abatement of his severity the mothers delicacy she possessed entire and whenever she touched upon any thing like her she endeavored to give it an agreeable coloring in this habit she was further confirmed by politenes a collateral relation by the mothers side who took upon her the care of her manners and instructed her perfectly in all the secondary qualities or lesser morals which are commonly known by the name of goodbreeding being confirmed in these principles raillery was at a mature age trusted abroad into the world where she had not been long before she was caressed by the courtly horace who took her home to his own house introduced her to mecaenas and found her of singular service in all his writings at the demise of that bard raillery wandered a vagrant up and down till at length she took it into her head to visit boileau in paris from whence she came over to england and resided for many years at twickenham with the late mr pope from whose retreat she would now and then make an excursion to pass some hours with doctor young and mr addison at present it is said that she is taken into keeping by a certain noble earl of whom she is so enamoured that it is confidently reported she will not quit his company though he is now in danger of becoming deaf and it is further said that she will stick by him to his last breath but at that unhappy juncture what will become of her no body can pretend to determine  true intelligence bedford coffeehouse oct    on saturday last the parliament of criticism met here pursuant to their adjournment when mr town made

your late recess from business and it is to be hoped that the effects of your allegiance will appear before the expiration of the winter  the act for a general naturalization of all foreign monsters

to call to me for some copy upon perusal it appeared to carry with it a vein of pleasantry not improper for my fair readers if therefore it will serve for one half hour to banish from their company a certain concomitant of the teaequipage called scandal i shall think this days paper subservient to a moral use  to charles ranger esquire sir the exercise of the fan was proposed in the days of the spectator as a study highly necessary to the ladies of great britain and the scheme offered to their consideration included all the requisite perfections in the management of that pretty versatile machine though i must allow that directions of this nature were greatly conducive to a proper display of many female charms there is still a more useful system of rules for the playing off loves artillery which i beg leave through the channel of your paper to convey to the notice of my beautiful countrywomen the system of rules which i here intend is the exercise of the lips and after mature consideration i think the whole secret may be comprised under the following heads  moisten your lips bite your lips open your lips close your lips pout your lips rest your lips the mouth being a leading feature in the countenance and the seat of the graces where all the winning loves and each amiable smile have planted their allurements there cannot be too much care employed by the ladies to acquire a pair of well disciplined lips readily obedient to each of the rules above established and capable with quickness and ease to perform every branch of this delectable exercise  with regard to the first word of command a due degree of moisture gives a sparkling luster to the natural vermillion of the skin like roses fresh besprinkled with the morningdew it contributes likewise to hinder them from appearing dry and rough as is generally the case with old maids the least suspicion of which the ladies seem willing to avoid by the present taste of extending the shape beyond its just proportion by a fashionable enormity of the stays  biting the lips is attended with more difficulty than the premised rule because it is more complicated in its nature and includes the operation of the passions there are always many topics in conversation upon which this practice if well managed has a very expressive significance when for instance disagreeable thoughts obtrude it serves to excite new ideas in the fancy it likewise prevents the unseasonable eruption of a conscious laugh when the libertine wit of congreve or vanbrugh provokes a betraying simper not to mention that it helps to heighten the natural redness of the lip and raises a degree of anxiety in the men for fear the delicacy of the skin should suffer too much from too violent a pressure  i do not doubt but it may seem perfectly easy to open the lips but this also i take to be a matter of no small difficulty very few it is observable open their lips to any purpose besides it should never be done with too great a precipitance but always gradually and by due degrees should there happen to be drawn up within an elegant row of beautiful white teeth it will be sure to add greatly to the natural bloom by exhibiting an agreeable contrast like ivory stained with a just arrangement of crimson colors on this head it may not be improper to caution my pretty readers against an indolent custom of relaxing into a yawn which distends the mouth beyond its proper size and generally occasions the witty saying thank you for not swallowing me  before the lips are closed it is eligible to confer upon them a new refreshment of moisture and to enliven the color if they were to undergo the operation of biting i should not think it amiss shutting the lips i have often remarked is extremely becoming in most ladies and i think cannot be too much practiced by old maids wives and indeed the generality of women in closing them however there are different degrees of pressure to be observed because in this also the passions are concerned when they gently touch each other it gives a variety to the air of the face by giving it an unusual degree of length but in this those who have naturally a long visage are to be particularly cautious when somewhat compressed the dimples in the cheeks are displayed to advantage and the whole face is enlivened with a pleasing serenity if squeezed close together it throws a beautiful pensiveness into the looks which is seldom acquired to any degree of perfection by the generality of the sex but when properly attained it carries with it an elegant kind of dumb eloquence which the critics have observed is often a great beauty in poetry and certainly has its portion of grace among the fair sex i know a gentleman who can read the thoughts of any lady whatever by observing the adjustment of the lips he tells me he has observed a pair of lips speak without any motion for an hour together and he has a list of lips which he says are absolute prudes others that are rakes some that are amorous and some that are swelled with pride and from a long course of enquiry he finds that they have more electricity than any other substance in nature  but these remarks belong more immediately to the following head of pouting the lips which is more difficult than any rule advanced as yet in doing this it will be always found expedient to moisten and bite them first that when prominent the underlip may look as if pregnant with delight the passions of scorn indignation contempt and the whole family of pride are finely marked by this position i have known a pouted lip to look down upon a rival beauty during an entire tragedy and i have seen a lady without uttering a single word tell a man that she thought him an unmannered coxcomb by a forcible exertion of this expressive feature i must observe that this practice becomes handsome faces only to such it gives an air of elevation or a pretty sullenness which throws a kind of amiable severity over the whole countenance ugly women seldom have this art in any perfection  the last rule is to rest your lips and is the most neglected of any though highly essential in this beautiful language young girls can never be brought to pay the least attention to this precept but were they sensible that when the features are lest to display their own native graces without art their charms are irresistible i am convinced this word of direction would be better observed this rule is more extensive than the foregoing because it is proper for all ladies in general whereas the former should never be practiced but by such of the fair as are blessed with a blooming complexion and a delicacy of features  the bounds of mr rangers paper will not permit me to expatiate further i shall therefore at maturity publish by subscription an entire book called the economy of the lips in which i shall explain at large the doctrine here delivered and i shall adapt each article to the make of the countenance the whole shall be concluded with an essay on the passions of the female lips and to the honor of this part of the face i shall prove that in these days of atheism all religion is centered with them as what few prayers are said at present come from the lips only without the understanding or heart being at all concerned in the matter i have the honor to be  sir your most obsequious humble servant john lipsalve p s the song in the beggars opera lip to lip while we are young then our lip to the glass will be considered with some hints to prevent the angry mab of shakespeare from causing blisters i

saturdays compositions i have observed that there is not one of them but has some degree of tendency to the instruction as well as entertainment of your readers on this account i hope you will not refuse a place in your paper to a correspondent who means to show the futility of a maxim which has gained credit with most people though extremely illgrounded as i think i can fairly evince from an experimental knowledge of mankind  you undoubtedly recollect that ovid has in one of his elegies the following lines  donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos tempora si fuerint nubila solus eris now sir it is so far from being true that a man is surrounded with friends in prosperity and is left destitute under his misfortunes that i will undertake to prove the very reverse in doing this i flatter myself i shall serve the purposes of virtue and vindicate the dignity of human nature  you must know then that i came to this town a few years since with intent to read the law having just fortune enough to support me in my studies until i might fix myself in a tolerable road of business for this purpose i lodged in one of the inns of court and the economy which i was obliged to observe rendering it impossible for me to go much into company i soon found out that i led a very muzzy sort of a life i therefore shifted the scene and though in a short time i found means to run out my little fortune i cannot say that i was relinquished by the world on this account it is true that some of my acquaintance totally deserted me but it was the occasion at the same time that others were more earnestly attached than they would otherwise have been i remember the last word my aunt in the country said to me was bob wherever you go be sure to make friends for yourself this advice i will venture to say i have had the address to conform to with great success as will appear from the sequel  most of the friendships of the world are leagues in debauchery and intemperance made in the drawing of a cork and often ended in the same manner out of sight out of mind is certainly true with regard to the generality of connections but the impressions i have made upon the minds of my friends are not so easily effaced on the contrary when it happens that i am seldom seen by them they are known to be in very great solicitude about me are constantly very earnest in their enquiries after me and the discourse they usually have with each other is have you seen our old friend lately  i cannot think what is become of him  i hope he is not gone out of town  i have not seen him for a long time  faith i am very uneasy about him  i wish to god he would see and settle his affairs  he is a very careless young fellow  a great deal too wild  throws away his money like dirt  i have called upon him morning after morning but all to no purpose  i would give a bottle of wine i could meet with him  i would rather that than my dinner  i never longed so much to see any body  these are the general expressions of anxiety which my friends express on my account and there are some of them who are not content to rest here words cost nothing they carry the thing to such a length as to employ a couple of fellows who are daily in all quarters of the town hunting and prying about for me as there are few instances of such earnest friendship in the world i am sensible what i have said may have a romantic appearance and mr ranger may suggest to himself that i am entertaining him all this time with a novel but sir i must take leave to assure you that every word is literally true and what may perhaps raise your idea still higher is not one of all these people has ever got a shilling by me and i verily believe few of them ever will having said thus much in the praise of these my wellwishers it will naturally be desired of me to inform the world who and what they are who are in such concern about a stranger not to keep you any longer in suspense i will now tell you that i have experienced all this generosity from my creditors  by this it will appear that the pleasure of being in debt though very common in life is very little understood by the generality of those who addict themselves to this gratification the art in all these cases is to refine upon the occurrences and disappointments to which our state is liable and for my part the pleasure just mentioned is one of the most valuable enjoyments of my life my morning levee is as great as any noblemans whereas in the days that that i could say i was in possession of a competence i never had any visitor whatever except a laundress to make my bed in the temple but now the case is perfectly altered there is a constant crowd of attendants about my oors and to those that are admitted i have the pleasure of making as many promises as a minister of state besides a lofty pride in keeping them much after the same fashion upon these occasions it will now and then happen that they who best know how to make their court and have the art of taking a pliant hour sometimes prevail upon me to appoint a day for the completion of their wishes as things of consequence cannot be done in a violent hurry the day agreed upon is generally very distant may be from six to nine or twelve months during which space of time it is observable that their goodnature never suffers the least abatement but they remain as solicitous as ever frequently expressing the most tender regard for my welfare my dear sir do take a little care of yourself  it goes to my very heart to hear you cough so hard  why you will not live three months at this rate  be advised by me and put a stocking about your neck tonight and take something to sweat you a little and ease your chest  you should not drink so much  consider it impairs both constitution and purse  you know it is for your good i speak  you would be a great loss to your friends  take up a little flesh and blood cannot hold it always  thus mr ranger am i beloved and that for no other reason but my address in making friends for myself and i am so closely watched by these generous creatures that it is totally out of my power to take any wrong step that might be detrimental to my affairs of this i had a convincing proof about a year ago when the interposition of my tailor hindered me from committing a very inconsiderate action i was going with a friend to take a trip to paris by which expedition i must certainly have been drained of all my ready money but the vigilance of my friend contrived to have me stopped as i was just stepping into the postchaise and i was thence conducted to a generous bailiffs house in graysinn lane for the sum of three hundred pounds here i remained confined till my passion for travel was perfectly cooled and when i was at length restored to my liberty my abovementioned friends took particular care not to leave me a single shilling for fear i should have the same unhappy turn a second time  while i thus enjoy the assiduity and benevolence of such a number who are kind enough to interest themselves in my affairs i must own there is a species of creditors who are an exception to the general rule for though all those of whom i have hitherto been speaking are upon every occasion highly pleased to meet me this last class detest the very sight of me as i am not conscious that i have ever done any thing to incur their displeasure to so great a degree their aversion shocks me the more and notwithstanding all the pains i have taken to soften them by politeness they still remain inexorable whenever i do not pay them what is due to them i endeavor to put them off with the handsomest apology in my power but all to no purpose i have run too far in arrears and they are not by any means to be satisfied as i should be glad if you would give them a word of advice i will just hint to you that the personages whom i mean are no other than gentlemens servants the cry among them all is what can a poor servingman do if he is robbed of his just vails by such scoundrels they are all very unwilling to let me run further in their debt and therefore it is i can hardly get any thing out of their hands if i call for beer at table they are sure not to hear me till their master orders them to serve the gentleman then i receive the leavings of the tankard just out of the hands of the most capacious swallow in the company in short the peevishness of these my creditors is a great discount upon my happiness and i must confess there is no kind of pleasure in being in debt to them however i must endeavor to bear this inconvenience and if you will be pleased to insert this letter in the grays inn journal i shall be proud to get into your books and shall have the further pleasure of being

writer of periodical essays is like one who goes coasting from place to place with intent to lay down a chart of the course of the country the extent of the several parts the bearings limits and connections as the latter fails along every minute object furnishes him with matter of contemplation and not a hill lifts its head whether clothed with verdure and imbowered with overhanging wood or wild barren and craggy but he instantly treasures it in the storehouse of imagination each recess of the land each creek rock and harbor demand a particular notice and he is frequently induced to pause in these reflections heedless of the unbounded prospect which the ocean presents him in like manner the person who is engaged in a course of lucubrations to be published on a stated day is constantly traversing about in order to delineate a just representation of the different scenes of life and to gratify his readers with particular charts which may either serve to please the fancy or contribute to the purposes of improvement and utility in his intercourse with men and manners every occurrence attracts his eye and in his converse with books he often meets with passages which deserve to be minutely set down in the account of his voyage through this sea of troubles and they may serve as lights or landmarks to those who are bound upon the same adventure  it is thus the best essays are suggested and i must own i never yet perused a good author but i thence deduced some hint which afterward unfolded several latent reflections that might otherwise escape me the classics are particularly useful in this way they display upon all occasions such bright traces of a manly way of thinking and abound with so many excellent and close remarks artfully interwoven with the thread of their poem or narration that a man conversant with their productions will be always able to draw very amply from their stores  in perusing a few nights since floruss compendium of the roman history i was greatly struck with an observation in the character of tarquin which that writer though no extraordinary master of the graces and elegancies of composition has found means to insert with his usual closeness tarquin says florus insulted all mankind with an overbearing pride which to an ingenuous mind is worse than cruelty this short observation most certainly carries with it a great deal of truth and deserves to be enforced with all the strength of reason and eloquence  a witty satirist has called pride the universal passion and indeed its influence on mankind is so manifest that there is too much reason to believe the maxim well founded the general prevalence of politeness suppresses in some measure the appearance of it among the french but any one who has been at versailles may remember that after all the attention and deference of the embroidered gentleman who undertakes the office of showing the curiosities of the place the ceremony is always concluded with a consciousness of their national superiority which breaks out in a brisk question with a shrug of the shoulder eh bien monsieur avez vous e pareille magnificence a londres well sir have you any thing equal to this in london in italy portugal and spain their haughtiness is manifested by the frequent use of the stilleto upon every trivial occasion pride is there displayed by killing others and the people of england discover it by murdering themselves  the notion of independance with which a freeborn briton is inflamed renders him untractable and refractory to all laws religion he makes a joke of and he wonders at the impertinence of the parliament in attempting to restrain his unquestionable right to dispose of his person as he pleases  the famous montesquieu imputes the variety of oddities which prevail in this country to the general infection of the scurvy but if he had charged it upon our national sturdiness i am inclinable to think he would have assigned a truer cause though perhaps at the same time black and sizy blood may not a little contribute to aggravate the distemper to speak with precision pride is to the soul what the scurvy is to the body each in their separate channels the source of ill humors maladies and disorders the fatal effects of the corporal indisposition just mentioned have been so severely felt for a long time past that our common newspapers are filled with advertisements of chemical drops to eradicate it entirely out of the blood this certainly would have been a great benefit to society but i apprehend he would deserve still more who should devise a cure for the disease of the mind on this account i should be glad to see a paragraph in the papers to the following effect  to persons of either sex afflicted with any species of pride  never were pride arrogance and haughtiness so frequent as of late years nor has any remedy been found adequate to this pernicious habit which occasioned a physician of the soul who employed his thoughts much concerning them to adapt a medicine or moral elixir which is a sovereign remedy against pride and all the variety of symptoms by which it mimics by turns almost all the vices poor mortals are afflicted with and have their rise from a depraved selfishness of thinking vicious ferments of ill nature and the want of selfknowledge whence proceed the supercilious brow and surly moroseness in the men and coquetry airs fidgets tehees and titters in the women which totally destroy their beauty and their features and by a consent of parts affect their heads and produce direful views and terrible apprehensions at other times fits flushing heats lowness and sinking of the spirits palpitation of the heart twitchings of the limbs with many convulsive disorders which affect numbers of both sexes  the above elixir is a wonderful alterative occasions laudable humility and as soon as taken makes the patient goodhumoured cheerful and affable to admiration and is good for all sorts of people to preserve as well as procure an even temper of mind  whenever i meet with a proud man i should be glad to know what he takes himself for and i have often imagined that if his inward state of mind were detected to the eye of the world it would afford a ridiculous contrast between his several foibles and his fancied elevation above the rest of his species for my part it never fails to divert me in a most exquisite manner when i observe a man sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster as shakespeare has it in order to receive the compliments of every one without any real merit to deserve them and without that reciprocal complacence which is always sure to procure esteem i would have such a one made emperor of the moon or removed to some other sphere fitted for his reception where cruelty may pass for courage ostentation for merit and pride for dignity  nothing can so surely demonstrate a narrow mind as an attempt to degrade our fellow creatures by an haughty arrogance of carriage hamlet reckons the insolence of office and the proud mans contumely among those instigations which might prompt injured merit to a deed of extreme despair and this further enforces the severity which is felt by him who is obliged to submit to it and the cruelty of that human brute who can think of putting it in practice  i cannot dismiss this paper without observing that there is a right species of pride to which every man is entitled and that is a spirit above dependence above flattery above an abject deportment and above every thing poor sordid and little there is a pride which may serve to invigorate honor to embolden truth and to carry virtue to an higher pitch of improvement than it might attain unassisted by this secondary motive the pleasures resulting from this principle are manly and noble to enjoy the inward consciousness of honor and honesty and to exult in the conviction of a persons own integrity probity and upright intentions is just and laudable thus much of pride every

undoubtedly receive great instruction  numb    graysinn saturday dec        respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo doum imitatrem et veras hinc ducere voces hor in a former essay i threw together a few thoughts upon the profession of an actor as a sequel to that piece i shall this day offer some loose hints upon the art and though this subject may not be interesting to every reader i yet persuade myself as the drama is the most polite and rational of our diversions that an attempt to throw some light upon the matter will be received with candor  the precept which the judicious author of my motto has laid down for the good writer is likewise the best rule for an actor for as both are professors of imitative arts the same rule is applicable to each i would recommend says horace to the skilful imitator a close and steady observance of men and manners and from that source i would have him draw an exact resemblance and the true language of nature this advice short and simple as it is contains the whole secret of succeeding with the public and whoever artfully conforms to it will be sure of acquiring applause from crowded theaters the actor in every situation on the stage is a copyist from human life the easy and genteel deportment of gentlemen is to be attained by an intercourse and free communication with people of that class the drawing room must be visited for a knowledge of the ease and dignity of men of rank and by this habitude the performer will fashion himself into a kind of mental elegance which will not sail to inform his whole person and set off every action with a graceful facility at the same time that it will enable him to be upon all occasions a more perfect imitator  to these external circumstances must be joined a close and intimate knowledge of the human heart its most secret movements must be unfolded and the actor must be thoroughly acquainted with their minutest effects upon the human body in what proportion they agitate the nerves and muscles how they impress the features with their respective signatures elevate or contract the brow brace or relax the sinews and command the attitude and disposition of the whole person there is not a passion in the whole train of those feelings to which our nature is subject but what has its own peculiar adjuncts its own air its own look and its own proper tone sorrow unnerves the whole system sinks the spirits and depresses the voice into a plaintive melancholy anger on the other hand contracts each sinew sends the spirits in a blaze to the eye and vents itself in precipitate and vehement accents in like manner every emotion of the soul has a sympathetic influence on the structure of the body and it is the immediate business of the performer who would aspire to excellence in the art to form to himself an exact definition of each passion with all its characteristics otherwise it will be impossible for him to mark the progress and workings of the mind awakened and excited by the vehemence of their impulse or to separate the tender desire of a romeo from the conjugal affection of jaffier  after having thus distinguished the nature and boundaries of each affection the next step to be taken is to watch the various shiftings and veerings of the soul and to observe how the several passions rise and fall in quick vicissitude the mind of man cannot dwell for any considerable time upon one object from whence it results that love and resentment grief and joy despair and hope rage and tenderness are perpetually taking their turns in the breast to perceive minutely the very point where the first ceases and the succeeding one begins to rise requires a nice discernment as in the well wrought piece of some eminent hand the colors run so artfully into one another that their gradual evanescence from the sight and their growing by insensible degrees into a full glow is only to be discovered by the curious eye if i do not mistake the touch which so skilfully blends different colors in this delicate confederacy is called by the painters the demitint should not something like this be preserved in the performances of a good actor in order to render each transition graceful and natural to melt the audience by regular essays into tenderness or induce any other impression with justness and propriety whatever passion has at any time taken possession of the heart must abate by degrees and the traces of it must be almost effaced before a contrary affection can gain admittance and whoever is careful to mark with feeling the ebbing out of the one and flowing in of the other will be always sure to have an irresistible command over his audience  but the matter does not rest here the performer who is ambitious of distinguishing himself for masterly touches in scenes of vehemence will find another latent secret in the intellectual system which must never escape his notice it must be remembered that there are frequent occasions in which the breast is distracted by two different passions at once both working the heart strings in one mixed emotion these complicated agitations of the mind are often imperceptible to all but the skilful observer and therefore as the actors chief difficulty lies in this point a feeling expression of it will always be a proof of his excellence and strokes of this nature well executed will impress on every breast the liveliest sensations  it often happens in mere descriptive poetry that the writer observing some surprising agreement between things which in their natures seem totally inconsistent with each other from thence takes occasion to reconcile contrarieties in such an agreeable assemblage that the tasteful reader is entertained with a picture which at once amuses his fancy and satisfies his judgment virgil has many delicate touches of this nature and horace who had art enough for every poetic embellishment has heightened his odes with several beauties of this sort in this class of elegancies may be reckoned the following passages urit grata proervitas  pignusque direptum lacertis aut digito male pertinaci  tityosque vultu risit invito    milton also who has every softer delicacy in minute descriptions as well as every lofty image in the sublime has inserted many beautiful colorings of this species in his paradise lost and his grinned horrible a ghastly smile is an admirable instance mr addison has given to thoughts of this nature the title of thwarting ideas and he adds that they are some of the finest strokes in the whole compass of poetry if i might be allowed to carry this hint further i should call all strokes of this kind where the mind is worked into a ferment by the name of thwarting passions and i will venture to say that they will be universally acknowledged much more beautiful than that mere clash of ideas which the eminent critic just mentioned has so much insided upon because they not only surprise with a seeming contrast but also interest the heart which is the perfection of poetry the greek and latin poets and indeed the fine writers among the moderns are full of these pathetic representations of human nature but among them all i do not remember a finer instance than a passage in mr whiteheads roman father when that hero is reflecting on the combat which is to decide the fate of rome   had i a thousand sons in such a cause i could behold em bleeding at my feet and thank the gods with tears  to express these complicated sensations where several passions at once agitate the soul requires such a command of countenance and voice that it is certainly the greatest perfection of an actor and with a kind of magic power it always leads us into the most pleasing distress  if the bounds of my paper would admit it i should here indulge myself in examining our present performers with regard to the three divisions of the passions above established to one i should perhaps ascribe the merit of expressing with proper enforcement the sentiments of haughty anger and tyrannic cruelty in another i should chiefly admire the graceful transition from rage to tenderness and probably i should not hesitate to say of a third that he is excellent in all vicissitudes of the mind and that in mixed sensations he penetrates to the very soul of his hearers and were i to add that in many situations i have experienced the same from mrs cibber it would be but barely doing her that justice which her excellent art deserves  from what has been premised it will appear that to express the emotions of the human heart is the chief business of an actor and no account is ever to be made of figure voice or any other external circumstances unless it be when they combine with the performers feelings to make deeper impressions on an audience i have known an actor lengthen out the tone of his voice and if it sounded clearly imagine his business finely executed when nature and the passions required that he should speak in another key and in broken short and vehement accents quinctilian has a just remark on this head as poets says he profess to sing their works verse should be repeated in a manner somewhat elevated above common discourse with a sweetness properly tempered by discretion and not thrilling into a wanton luxuriance of sound as if the throat had been gargled for the purpose i shall only add a lively

train of thought the other night and having an imagination which does not very soon detach itself from the objects that have once possessed it the same scenes of reflection disclosed themselves to me in sleep and formed a prospect not unentertaining to my fancy  i thought the hemisphere on a sudden brightened with more than common luster a flood of glory diffusing itself through all creation and from an opening of the heavens appeared high exalted on a throne the genius of human kind after a trumpet had sounded three times the following sounds were awfully pronounced let all those fleeting spirits which formerly animated corporal tenements forthwith appear from their several mansions of retribution and let those who now support a feverish existence upon earth instantly repair hither divested of their bodily encumbrance and account before our dread presence for the use they have made of their time during their state of probation  the edict was immediately obeyed and i fancied that i had no sooner emerged from my tenement of clay than every thing wore another appearance and new faculties of perception were assigned me vanished were the original colors concerning which so many volumes have been written wit taste learning philosophy mathematics and even money itself appeared an absolute chimaera and several personages beginning to address the throne i was further confirmed in my opinion that all was idleness vanity and unavailing vexation  homer declared his whole poem to be the rhapsody of an everweening imagination he owned his celestial councils and his battle of the gods to be a jumble of absurdities his boldest flights of fancy appeared quite contemptible and he wondered how he could ever employ his faculties in stringing together such wild enthusiastic reveries  plato owned that he knew nothing of the first good first perfect and first fair and lord shaftsbury wished that instead of being guided by that pagan philosopher he had made use of the light of revelation which might have afforded him some faint dawning ideas of that truth of which he is now perfectly convinced he added that he did not know what he was about when he wrote his rhapsody and many other parts of his performance and that he now looked back at them with contempt  aristotle declared his system of logic to be nothing but an idle scheme of labored perplexities calculated to puzzle and bewilder mankind pindar smiled at his olympics and did not hesitate to say that he really believed he was mad when he wrote them and old euclid who i believe never once laughed on earth burst into a loud expression of mirth when he reflected upon his endeavors to square the circle and his several triangles and quadrangles which he owned do not contribute in any degree to the advancement of virtue  alexander frankly confessed himself a child for weeping  more worlds caesar declared he would as contentedly be the last in a village as the first in rome and pompey had no longer an aversion to an equal cicero without elaborating a period of a mile condemned his pursuit of fame as no more than the chasing an empty bubble and he added that he never thought himself properly employed but when expatiating against the minute philosophers virgil still persisted that his whole aeneid should be burned horace and ovid both laughed at the duration of their works which in their days of nature they flattered themselves would be indelible monuments of their fame  in short among all the celebrated personages of antiquity every one accused himself of misapplication and even titus complained that he had lost many days  there were those who acknowledged that they never knew uneasiness in life but what was occasioned by the success of others and that they were always completely happy or completely miserable by comparison poets laughed at all their pains to tag a rhyme and their solicitude for works which now appeared to them in a proper light and critics acknowledged that they took too much unnecessary trouble to destroy productions of so perishable a nature the miser railed at insolvent gold as it is finely called by the witty doctor young and his heart expanded with generosity and social affection  the softer sex presented themselves among the rest on this occasion but the simper of selfadmiration no longer displayed itself they were not anxious aabout the gloss of their skin the arrangement of a curl or the disposition of a patch the snowy breast ceased to heave with studied carelessness and the shape was not tortured a thousand ways in order to look attractive in the eye of man the labors of the toilet were now despised and each fairone wondered how dress could make so great a part of the business of life and how they could ever take so much pride in perishable clay however neatly molded and however tinctured with a pleasing hue they were now persuaded that true beauty dwells in the mind drums routs and cards were held in contempt and as mr pope has it they viewed with scorn two pages and a chair they were all ashamed of the falsehoold of their friendships their tehees and titters at a ruined character their several turns of coquetry dissimulation and all the variety of female artifice in short mankind in general owned themselves distracted with cares beneath a rational creature and envy pride selfishness perfidy and ambition swelled the vast account  from these disturbers of our happiness i was rejoiced to see my fellow creatures relieved and to perceive love joy and benevolence effacing gradually all traces of former guilt gave me an inexpressible delight but i soon found i was not in reality launched into eternity and therefore my joy like all things subject to time and mortal chance soon came to an end the fumes of sleep were dissipated and i awaked from my dream loose as it is the reader may derive this moral from it that there is nothing in human life worth the anxiety it creates and that it should be our business at present to fix those propensities and habits in our souls which we shall not have occasion hereafter to wish totally effaced and which it is probable we shall be carrying to an higher degree of purity in those mansions which are prepared for our future existence  true intelligence drury lane playhouse dec        on saturday last was presented at this theater for the first time the tragedy of boadicia with all the advantages of exhibition which new scenery new dresses and the excellent performance of mr garrick mrs cibber and mrs pritchard could give it it was certainly a bold enterprise in mr glover after shakespeare has given us such a taste for wild and savage liberty to attempt a piece conformable to the rules and simplicity of the stagyrite and hence it arose that some scenes were not found busy enough however the fire of the author glows intensely through the whole and all his descriptions of the distant battle and his allusions to the hallowed groves of the druids are finely interwoven as this composition is remarkable for an elegant purity of diction which instead of overcharging nature sets her off in all the graces and embellishments of poetry i am persuaded it will prove a good closet companion and i shall only add that if voltaire were to criticize this production he would in justice wave his favorite phrases barbarous monstrous farces etc and would allow this piece to be the work of a very elegant finished taste  numb    graysinn saturday dec          pictis bellantur amazones armis virg i paid a visit a few days since to a lady for whom i always entertained a very high esteem on account of a pleasing turn of conversation and many other good and agreeable qualities which she is possessed of  mrs millefont for that is her name was never known to have the least propensity to scandal or detraction she does not concern herself with the impertinent knowledge of who and who were together at the masquerade who were seen to interchange a few fond regards at the theater or who has lately had an ill run at play politeness goodnature and affability are her characteristic perfections and she is ready to allow wit and beauty in others as well as in her own daughters though in my opinion it is a rare thing to see them equalled by any of their sex both the young ladies are tall and graceful elegant in shape and delicate in their features extremely like each other in the turn of the face and still each of them forming if i may be allowed to use the phrase a different school of beauty  harriet being two years elder is rather more formed and higher in bloom than her sister but seems to be sensible of the approaching eclipse which her beauty must suffer very shortly when all the charms which are at present budding forth in the person of charlot have attained their full perfection though harriet is sensible of this she yet perceives it without any proneness to envy on the contrary she rallies herself with great vivacity and will fairly own that she is upon the lookout for a man for herself before charlot becomes so mischievous a beauty as to engross the attention of every beholder and then says she i shall lose all my admirers and so i am resolved to get married out of the way  on this account she at present throws the dart like a tyrant as the poet phrases it though i am convinced when she resigns her person her good sense will then lead her to imitate the gentleness and amiable disposition of charlot who does not aim at being so fierce a beauty as harriet but is chiefly desirous to be mistress of willing hearts she does not endeavor to kindle her eyes into that glare of fire for which many others are remarkable but unambitiously she lets them shine in their own native mildness and if the captivates every heart it is without any premeditated design in short the difference between these two young ladies is this charlots charms have a constant emanation and harriets beauties are in a perpetual exertion  i spent an hour in the most agreeable manner with this family when harriet in her giddy manner gave a new turn to the conversation by asking me pray mr ranger can you tell me something about macklins new scheme pray what is the man about  to this i replied that i really was not sufficiently in the secret that he has built two magnificent rooms and intends to furnish them in an elegant manner the apartment on the groundfloor to be a public coffeeroom and the other for the reception of gentlemen of rank and education but that however i was afraid he would share the common fate of projectors  well i vow and protest says harriet it is a vexatious thing to see how these men are always contriving places for their own accommodation without troubling their heads about the women the odious things are always herding with one another and the ladies are sequestered from all the joys of these convenient meetings does not one hear them eternally saying with an air of indifference maam i must go the coffee house and so saunter away with that janty careless air that never fails to provoke me  well i wish the women would agree to have a coffeehouse of their own to be revenged of the fellows  lord mr ranger it would do charmingly dont you think so sister  it would so tantalize the creatures to see us going into a place where none of them can gain admittance  they would be so proud to wait at the door to hand us to our chairs and it would be such a pleasure to go and meet ones acquaintance without going constantly in a stiff dress to routs and drums dear ranger you must give us an helping hand you must give us an essay upon it you wild devil with this she tapped me on the shoulder in her lively agreeable manner and insisted with all the rhetoric of a romp that i should propose her scheme to the public which i assured her i should take the first opportunity to perform  i have ever been of opinion that in the general coffeehouses are not of such advantage as is generally imagined most of these places being frequented entirely by bucks bloods and rakes of all denominations from whom there is nothing to be acquired except a swagger in the gait a drunken totter a noisy riotous deportment a volley of oaths and a total want of what is called good breeding perhaps this opportunity of detaching themselves from the ladies in coffeehouse clubs is the cause of that aukwardness which is frequently remarkable in persons who from their fortunes and situation in life should be better accomplished and on this account i am apprehensive that a rendezvous of this nature might have some ill effect upon the deportment of the fair but should this scheme be carried into execution i must acknowledge that it will in many respects set the ladies upon a par with the men and the convenience of meeting people of fashion without the necessary parade of going to their houses will certainly be very great also appointments with each other may be fixed with ease by the means of this institution and a memorandum book placed at the bar as at the bedford and other places may serve for the following purposes  lady laststakes came according to appointment to meet lady betty modish is gone to hear shuter give the london cries will be here again after the play when she will be glad to have a party of picquet with lady betty and spend the

will call here again and begs miss limber tongue will leave word where she may be heard of  miss tattled begs to see miss graveairs has a million of things to say to her and particularly something she heard last night at lady hurlyburlys  such proceedings as these will inevitably do honor to the amiable sex and as they may judge it necessary to claim an equal expire over the world i beg leave to offer them a few rules which may serve to conduct a female coffeehouse with proper regularity  a system of rules etc i that each lady shall pay sixpence at the bar whether she drink tea coffee chocolate capillaire cronwater or ratafia etc ii that the actresses shall be admitted to this coffeehouse by which means the ladies may become full as good critics as the men iii if a quarrel should arise between any of the ladies they shall not fall to pulling caps in company but take another opportunity to vindicate their honor iv if any lady is discovered with a pairroyal of aces in her pocket or endeavors to use any sinister artifice at cards she shall be expelled the club with as much strictness as if it happened at whites v if any young lady offers herself to be chosen into the club by ballot a single white ball shall be sufficient to admit her it being improbable that a real beauty will obtain that favor from above one of her sex vi and lastly it shall be deemed meritorious in any lady to brag of her intrigues her amors by which means the ladies may in imitation of the laudable practice among the opposite sex talk of beauties whom they never saw and fancy raptures which they never knew  true intelligence from my registeroffice dec    by letters from a correspondent abroad we are informed that when monsieur voltaire was arrested by order of the king of prussia there were found among his papers several translations of different passages in shakespeare done so extremely ill that it is conjectured he purposely made use of a frigid languor of expression in order to lessen the poets reputation abroad in hopes that then himself might be set down as the greatest dramatic poet in the world but to quiet this restless ambition we must inform him that apollo has long since issued out his prohibition so that he may swell like the frog in the fable without ever coming near him non si te ruperis inquit par eris the same advices mention that there were also several abusive

monstrous farces of shakespeare and lopez de vega which have obtained the name of tragedies is it not invidious in monsieur voltaire to mention lopez de vega in conjunction with a poet whom in his soul he cannot but reverence as a genius superior to all the dramatic writers in the world and of whom he has frequently availed himself as mr voltaire is so rigid a critic we shall one day hold an enquiry into his poetical merit and therefore we think proper to publish the following  advertisement preparing for the press a critical enquiry into the poetical merit of the celebrated voltaire in which the beauties and defects of his fables will be considered and the great superiority which shakespeare boasts over him and all other poets whatever in point of sentiment passion character and diction will be set forth in the clearest light to conclude with an account current between voltaire and the english nation in which will appear on one side the abuse he has occasionally thrown out against our poets and on the other side the clandestine use he has made of them in almost all his plays  numb    graysinn saturday dec         haud facile cinergunt quorum virtutibus obstat res

that he had more difficulty in acquiring the first three thousand pounds than all the rest of his immoderate wealth this apothegm may be said to comprize the whole arcanum of rising in the world but as not one of the adepts in the science has thought proper to discover the secret art of putting this rule in practice it is to be apprehended the indigent will find as many difficulties as ever to retard their progress and hinder them from emerging out of their embarrassments the author of my motto has observed many ages since that the most exalted virtues and the rarest accomplishments do not find it easy to extricate themselves out of difficulties and the course of human contingencies has proved the maxim true to this day  there is perhaps hardly any man but can point out in the circle of his acquaintance certain personages of very extensive capacities strong and quick parts and a delicate sense of honor who are not however able to raise themselves to any conspicuous point of eminence merely because their talents have not been called forth by opportunity or animated by success genius wherever it subsists must be warmed and cherished otherwise it is apt to languish and decay the fine sensations which are attendant on an enlightened understanding occasion a certain delicacy in the possessors way of thinking which renders him liable to a dejection of spirits upon many occasions in life refined parts should be tenderly preserved or they are liable to be chilled by the blasts of adversity like those fruits which would wither unripened in our cold northern clime were they not carefully assisted in their vegetation by the adventitious use of hot beds  the circumstance which in my opinion reflects the greatest luster upon the character of lord summers is the encouragement he afforded to such a genius as mr addison who might have remained in a less conspicuous point of view without the assistance of such a patron his vein of humor which is now the genteelest in the world might have taken a tincture from low life his delicate raillery might have subsided into coarse and vulgar railing his taste which was finished by travel and every other advantage might have grown quite callous and indelicate for his sentiments of morality might have been substituted a strain of ribaldry to awaken the blum of confusion in that female face which as matters happened he took so much pains to set off in the smiles of native innocence and unaffected beauty and that pen which entertained the town with some of the most elegant productions of human wit might have been employed in politics personal invective and partyrage but the kindly protection of the lord summers hindered him from sinking into obscurity and from being compelled by necessity to sully that fair fame which is now the reward of his excellent performances the assistance of so eminent a person was a kind of demand upon him for all that elaborate elegance which now distinguishes itself in his writings  he from the taste obscene refines our youth and sets the passions on the side of truth pope it has been the fate of many endowed perhaps with parts not very inferior to addison to droop in indigence their poetic fires totally extinguished and i make no manner of doubt but in the present age there are those who might become shining ornaments of the republic of letters were there any incitement to spur the muses steed but a treatise on cribbidge or a calculation of the chances at whist is sure of being better received at present than the odes of a collins or any performance of distinguished genius while a smart subsists among us i cannot help thinking it an indelible reproach to the age that he has not any where sound a mecaenas and that he is suffered to draw his pen in the praises of his maker without receiving any other reward than a small premium at cambridge and that portion of fame which in spite of malice and envy he will be always sure to enjoy  wit is generally considered as an object of ridicule rather than an accomplishment deserving encouragement and esteem and the narrowness of fortune in which most of the literary tribe are situated is a standing topic of pleasantry and to call a man a poet is in most companies a stroke of irresistible humor the witty doctor young has ridiculed this with his usual delicacy  these when their utmost venom they would spit most barbarously tell you  he is a wit poor negrces thus to show their burning spite to cacodaemons say they are devilish white there is hardly any thing more affecting to a man of real merit than to find himself scorned by the insolence of pursepride people of affluence should consider when they attempt to depreciate men of superior parts that they betray an unmanly triumph over those who have still their fortune to make but as mr pope finely observes the world in general is apt to form an idea of a man at the time he is least able to make a proper judgment for himself and from thence it results that we find many utterly ruined by slight errors trivial indiscretions and petty inadvertencies while others owe their elevation to vices to headstrong passions and a series of selfish views which are for the greater part more successful than modesty a sober understanding and a spirit above abject flattery and mean submission  they who sit smiling at the goal of fortune while others are running the hardy course should reflect that it is possible for perseverance and unremitted application to reach the very point in which they take so much pride and then it is evident on which side the superiority will be found a well turned spirit with the advantages of a genteel education and a competent knowledge of the world must certainly receive additional luster from an accession of wealth

internal view of his own mental constitution to observe the various association of ideas combined with a rapidity which scarcely leaves a trace behind it to watch the subtle movements of the passions and thence to deduce the secret source of many of our sensations which are in appearance extremely complicated and surprising is a task requiring the finest perception in the research and also productive of the most useful knowledge we can boast and the highest delight our faculties are susceptible of  the solution of a mathematical problem may be agreeable to that curiosity which is implanted in us and the newtonian philosophy may expand the imagination with stupendous ideas of the distances of heavenly bodies but in these occupations like swifts tailor it is possible we may mistake one figure and then all our ingenious labor evaporates into air whereas in the pursuit of selfknowledge our reasonings are from feeling and all our discoveries besides the advantage of being as surprising as in any other science carry with them a further accession of pleasure as we are ourselves more immediately concerned in them in traveling through an open champain country the prospect on every side may administer to the pleasures of imagination but a man will certainly feel more lively sensat ons when riding upon land belonging to himself the landscape of his own estate will look more beautiful to the eye the lawn shall spread a more pleasing verdure and the discovery of a mine or the secret spring of a little rill running through his meadows aford him a delight not to be equalled by the gayest scenes that can be presented to him  the study of the human mind is therefore the most rational and pleasing employment we are capable of for my part i am always highly delighted when any accidental circumstance throws me into this tract of thinking and whether reading rabelaiss frolic ravings or the sublime enthusiasm of homer i am sure ever and anon to lay aside the volume in order to trace the pleasure which i have received to its hidden source and to account for the appearance upon some principle in our constitution an opportunity of gratifying this turn occurred to me the other day when casually turning over some of the most beautiful passages in epic poetry i could not help taking notice that i perused the description of thousands stretched upon the field of battle weltring in blood agonizing with their wounds and trampled under horses hoofs without feeling any of those propensities to compassion which were frequently awakened in me by the death of a single person i could read with the greatest composure and serenity lines which mention dying groans of numbers falling in one promiscuous carnage broken limbs of warriors men and horses all mixed in one general scene of destruction  tum vero gemitus morientum and sanguine in alto armaque corporaque and permisti caede virorum semianimes volvuntur equi  a musterroll of heroes who in one line embraced their fate did not move me to the least tender sensation  chloreaque sybarimque daretaque thersilocumque alcandrumque haliumque noemonaque prytanimque the mind is totally impassive in all these general accounts of the calamities of war but when the poet thinks proper to distinguish a single person from the throng we melt in pity of his fate heedless of the general devastation which is spread around him that this is the case every body that has read the aeneid will be ready to acknowledge and yet it might be imagined that our hearts should be more intensely agitated when desolation sweeps whole ranks of our fellow creatures from the face of the earth than when we read the fate of an individual but such is our disposition that we can go through all these narratives without emotion and when the epic writer throws out but a short reflection upon the fall of one man we are instantly fixed in attention and our hearts throb with compassion for his untimely end  the reason of this i take to be that in the former case we are only told that so many embraced their fate in battle in which circumstance there is nothing to excite commiseration in a reasonable being death is one of the conditions of human life and we all hold our existence in this world upon the same precarious tenure we therefore consider the descriptions of homer and virgil as no more than a mere bill of mortality and when they inform us that such a number perished upon the spot we peruse it with as much calmness as the paragraph which tells us increased in the burials this week five hundred and further when they tell us that one receives an arrow in the jugular vein another has a spear run through his shoulder and is rivetted with his body double to the ground a third is wounded in the mouth and has his head split in two it may serve as the critics observe to give variety to the battle but in fact amounts to no more than what we read in a common news paper yesterday a labourer fell from the top of an house by which accident he broke his collar bone and instantly expired an account of bodily pain has but a very slight influence upon our passions it is mental distress that principally operates upon our hearts and our pity rises in proportion to the agitations of mind which we perceive in the person afflicted besides this the poet frequently finds collateral avenues to our souls by a mention of familyconnections and to heighten our sorrow he addresses himself to the moral sense of his reader and interests him still more in the fate of his hero by representing his amiable qualities and the elegant accomplishments which would have rendered him a deserving member of society by these mears our tenderest feelings are awakened and the effect is not unlike what a man may experience in a churchyard where he sees a multitude of different graves in which the good the bad the old and young lie in promiscuous silence and he therefore beholds the scene without emotion but as soon as the tomb stone presents a character of one distinguished from the rest he then laments the generous friend the tender husband the indulgent father and mourns for him who acted agreeably to the relations in which he stood to his fellow creatures thus when we read of a dying person that he was a friend of the muses and that harmony was the delight of his soul we consider him in a different light from those who as mr addison expresses it are celebrated for nothing but being knocked in the head  amicum cretea musis cretea musarum comitem cui carmina semper et citharae cordi numerosque intendere nervis when we are told of another that his death was lamented by his friends in sundry parts of his country we cannot help joining in the general grief te nemus agnitiae vitrea te fucinus unda te liquidi flevere lacus  the number of sufferers is increased and our passions increase in proportion to the knowledge conveyed to us of their affections their tender friendships and their schemes for future happiness one falls in the midst of his halffinished projects him his blooming mistress mourns with frantic sorrow and all his relations bewail his loss another receives his mortal wound through the very garment which his mother worked for him with her own hands trarsiit and parmam mucro levia arma minacis et tunicam molli matter quam neveral auro implevitque sinum sanguis  besides these little touches which the epic writer occasionally makes use of to awaken and engage the passions they are further obliged to diversify their battles with episodes or short accounts of particular adventures in order to secure our attention and relieve us from that general scene of slaughter which they are conscious we peruse without any of those sensations which it is the primary excellence of poetry to excite thus the story of nisus and euryalus will always soften the eader into compassion when other passages in one line of which there is infinitely more mischief done will be passed over with indifference i should not think the worse of him that should calmly go through most of the battles in epic poetry but i hope there is not one of my readers who would not yield to the tenderest impressions at the fall of pallas and the lamentation of aeneas over his dead body  the use i would make of what has been premised is that as our passion are worked up in proportion to the many amiable qualities of the character in distress and the keeness of mental sensation which we suppose it suffers our modern writers of tragedy should attach themselves to this circumstance and consider that it is not the theatrical apparatus the bowl the dagger the dungeon or the clink of chains that can affect an audience but a faithful portrait of a mind struggling with various sensations if the players would also consider the same noise and rant would be effectually banished and instead of aiming at applause by the mere effect of own sonorous voices they would endeavor by every look every tone and every attitude to mark the infelt anguish of their minds  true intelligence bedford coffeehouse dec    the following is a copy of mr

beautiful moral who is there says the bard that can desire an accession of false honor who is not sensible of some inherent defect and who can be alarmed at the blasts of calumny and detraction who

heart of every man who would pass through life with an honest and fair fame as it suggests a just contempt for all illgrounded applause and furnishes the man of upright heart with the proper weapons of a noble disregard for the mean designs of slander and malevolence  hypocrisy is considered by all moralists as the most despicable and infamous disease of the soul it discovers a sense of the grace and beauty of a fair character but generally carries with it a total absence of all good qualities it aims at esteem by artfully concealing the latent imperfections and exhibiting to the public eye a glossy appearance of something amiable and honest but unless the mind is thoroughly weeded in spite of every artful disguise the lurking mischief will one time or other break out and as perseus

as the world now goes there is more art to acquire the popular opinion than merit to deserve it and the general method by which people grasp at fame consists in depreciating some neighbors character

a visit  covent garden theater the italian burletta which was rerformed here for the first time about the middle of last month has continued to draw splendid audiences three times a week ever since a burletta is a mock performance intended to burlesque the incidents and music of the italian opera but whatever humor it may contain is certainly lost to an english audience however notwithstanding these disadvantages one of this exotic troop who in the piece is called spiletta has such a quick expression of humor in her countenance such a vivacity of action joined to such variety that she is

teren at the last meeting of our club my friend mr candid informed us that he had lately seen the character of king lear admirably performed by mr garrick and that he had since thrown together some remarks upon that excellent tragedy which he desired i would this day communicate to the readers of the grays innjournal  to be able to criticize a poet with any degree of perspicuity it is requisite to consider the nature of his fable and the moral use of the work this being sketched we may then proceed to observe how he lays on his coloring the disposition of each personage the expression of the passions and which is the capital figure in the piece lear being examined in this manner it will appear that the author intended to exhibit in the most striking colors the horrid crime of filial ingratitude to enforce this he represents an old monarch tired with the cares of state and willing to distribute his possessions among his daughters in proportion to their affections toward his person accordingly the two that flatter him obtain all the third sister being disinherited for her sincerity and the king is at length driven by the ingratitude of his two eldest daughters to an extreme of madness which produces the finest tragic distress ever seen on any stage  as this is the groundwork of the play i am surprised that any critic should impute the madness of lear to the loss of royalty the behavior of his children is always uppermost in his thoughts and we perceive it working upon his passions till at length his mind settles into a fixed attention to that single object this i think will appear in a critical examination of the play  lear in his first scene shows himself susceptible of the most violent emotions the poet has drawn him impetuous to the greatest degree proud haughty revengeful and tenderhearted in such a mind it is not to be wondered that illtreatment should excite the most uneasy sensations he takes fire at an imaginary appearance of disaffection in cordelia  but goes thy heart with this so young and so untender he is soon after alarmed with suspicions of disrespect from gonerill i will look further into it  he then is convinced of her contemptuous disregard and the effect it has upon him indicates a mind impotent and liable to the worst perturbations d lear walk thus speak thus where are his eyes either his notion weakens his discernings are lethargyd  his reflections after this show what is nearest to his heart  ingratitude thou marblehearted fiend more lideous when thou show thee in a child than the sea monster  he observes that cordelias fault was small and when even that made such an impression on him what are we to expect from his fiery disposition when rejected by those to whom he had given all his imprecation though big with horror is the natural result of his indignation and the tenderness and overflowings of softness which melt him in the midst of his vehemence produce a fine conflict of passions thuntented woundings of a fathers curse pierce every sense about thee  old fond eyes reweep this cause again i will pluck ye out and cast ye with the waters that you lose to temper clay  his haughtiness then breaks out in a menace to his daughter thou shalt find that i will resume the shape which thou do think i have cast off forever his address to regan is extremely tender and pathetic thy tenderhested nature shall not give thee over to harshness and a little after thou better know the offices of nature bond of childhood effects of courtesy dues of gratitude thy half of the kingdom thou have not forgot wherein i thee endowed    there have been many poets who were acquainted in general with the passions of human nature and accordingly we find them constantly describing their effects but shakespeares art shows their impulse and their workings without the aid of definition or flowery description besides the general survey of the heart he was more intimately versed in the various tempers of mankind than any poet whatever we always find that he makes the passions of each personage in his drama operate according to his peculiar habit and frame of mind and in the tragedy in question there are so many strokes of this nature that in my opinion it is his masterpiece in every speech in lears mouth there is such an artful mixture of thwarting passions that the heart strings of an audience are torn on every side the frequent transition and shifting of emotions is natural to every breast but in lear they are characteristical marks of his temper  i prythee daughter do not make me mad i will not trouble thee my child farewell well meet no more  no more see one another but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter or rather a disease that is in my flesh etc but i will not chide thee let shame come when it will i do not call it i do not bid the thunder bearer shoot nor tell tales of thee to high judging jove in this speech every masterpassion in his temper rises in conflict his pride his revenge his quick resentment and his tenderness shakespeare has beautifully repeated instances of this nature in almost every line and the following passage has some of the finest turns in the world  o let not womans weapons waterdrops stain my mans cheeks  no ye unnatral hags  i will have such revenges on ye both  i will do such things what they are i know not  but they shall be the terrors of the earth  you think i will weep  no  i will not weep  i have full cause of weeping  this heart shall break into a thousand flaws  or ever i will weep  o fool i shall go mad here the distressed monarch leaves his daughters roof and the next time we see him he is on a wild heath in a violent storm where all his reflections take a tincture from the gloomy color of a mind diseased with anguish and we soon see what is the principal object of his attention  thou allshaking thunder crack natures mould all germins spill at once that make ungrateful man and again the tempest in my mind does from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there  filial ingratitude   his sudden apostrophe to his daughters must draw tears from every eye o regan gonerill your old kind father whose frank heart gave all the breaking off has a fine effect  o that way madness lies  let me shun that  no more of that  as yet the perturbation of his mind does not seem fixed to a point he begins to moralize but still with a view to his own afflictions until edgar enters disguised like a madman lears first question is have his daughters brought him to this pass could thou save nothing did thou give them all  and this i take to be the first touch of fixed madness in the play and might point out to any man the cause of his destraction without thinking of the resignation of his scepter or the mere loss of regal power  as our hero is now out of his senses a new field opens itself to the poet he had before displayed every movement of the heart and the human understanding now becomes his province in which we shall find he acquits himself with the most masterly skill mr lock observes that madmen do not seem to have lost the faculty of reasoning but having joined together some ideas very wrongly they mistake them for truths and they err as men do that argue right from wrong principles for by the violence of their imaginations having mistaken their fancies for realities they make right deductions from them  agreeably to this account lear upon the appearance of a madman takes it for granted that it is owing to his daughters illtreatment and when contradicted he replies death traitor nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters  he next takes him for a philosopher and agreeably to that notion enquires what is the cause of thunder  in his next scene a desire of revenging his grievances actuates his mind to have a thousand with red burning spits come hizzing in upon em he then proceeds to arraign his daughters in a court of justice arraign her first it is gonerill i here take oath before this honorable assembly  she kicked the poor king her father  here is another too whose warpt looks proclaim what store her heart is made of  he still continues to dwell in imagination upon the crime of ingratitude which appears to him so shocking that he exclaims let them anatomize regan  see what breeds about her heart  is there any cause in nature for these hard hearts this last stroke cannot fail to draw tears from every eye the reader will please to observe that all this time there is not a word said of his royalty on the contrary he says to edgar you sir i entertain for one of my hundred only i do not like the fashion of your garment etc which hundred was appointed after his abdication  after this how was shakespeare to represent lear again so as to keep up the passions and heighten the distress by taking advantage of every circumstance in lears temper he had said that he would reassume the shape he had cast off this then remained untouched and accordingly in the next scene we perceive him actually putting it in execution and his fancy suggests to him that he is a king from which he reasons as from every other principle and always with an eye to his children no they cannot touch me for coining i am the king himself there is my gauntlet  i will prove it on a giant from this his imagination wanders bring up the brown bills  o well flown barb in the clout in the clout  hewgh give the word  from this rambling he soon returns and the habitual ideas again take possession of him ha regan gonerill they flattered me like a dog etc after this gloster enquiring if it is not the king he catches at the word and answers ay every inch a king and then he draws some more inferences from that notion till he reflects that glosters bastard son was kinder to his father than his own daughters got in lawful sheets from this he digresses into an invective against women and continues raving till at length his spirit of revenge returns upon him and when i have stolen upon these sonsinlaw then kill kill kill kill  it was shakespeares art to reserve his being crowned with straw for the last scene of his madness as it is a representation of human nature reduced to the lowest ebb had he lost his reason on account of his abdicated throne the emotions of pity would not be so intense as they now are when we see him drove to that extreme by the cruelty of his own children every topic of parental distress being exhausted and all the kings masterpassions displayed in his madness the poet judiciously shows him gradually coming to himself in the next scene and we see the ideas dawning slowly on his soul where have i been  where am i  fair daylight in this recollection of his reason he never once mentions the loss of royalty but again touches upon the cause of his distress in his speech to cordelia i know you do not love me for your sisters have as i do remember done me wrong you have some cause they have not  so that before his madness in it and after it lear never loses sight of the ideas which had worn such traces on his brain and he must be unfeeling to the great art of our poet who can look for any other cause of distress in scenes which are drawn so forcibly and strong and kept up with the most exquisite skill to the very dying words of the unhappy monarch  true intelligence

elegant a critic the reader will judge of the matter for himself and upon a future occasion i shall offer some further considerations on this subject and will only hint for the present that i hope it will not be any detriment to me that i publish a genteel performance which is in some measure against what i have advanced i flatter myself i shall not have reason to be sorry for admitting him into my province and to say with the poet et regni demens in part vocavi virg  to charles ranger esquire sir to address a letter to you under the character of of mr ranger i am persuaded needs little apology especially when it goes from one who though a stranger to you has a real regard to your reputation as an author and having often received great pleasure from your weekly essays takes this liberty of throwing out his thoughts to you on a piece of criticism in which he differs with you is opinion  your paper of last saturday an examen of king lear and you think many critics have mistaken the principal idea in the old kings mind during his state of madness after citing lears exclamation on the ingratitude of his daughters you add this might lead any man to the cause of lears madness without thinking of the resignation of his scepter but certainly whoever considers lears character with attention will from the very passage you quote beside an hundred others think there is much to be said on the other side of the question  i have read with great pleasure several of the remarks you make on the speeches in lear which are such as can arise only in the mind of a reader of taste but i cannot agree that he must be unfeeling to the great art of our poet who can look for any other cause of distress in the madness of the king than the ingratitude of his daughters  i know not in what manner you may treat the remarks i am about to make but i can sincerely assure you they are only intended as hints to yourself on a subject which i think of some consequence to the admirers of shakespeare  the critic in the adventurer was somewhat wanting in justice to the poet by mentioning the loss of royalty as the sole cause of lears madness without taking notice at the same time of the forcible idea he must have of the ingratitude of his two daughters and i think mr ranger also wrong in excluding entirely his opinion what i purpose here is to point out both the ideas working strongly in his mind and what the author intended as conducive to the moral of his play  no critic on shakespeare can better explain the characters he draws than the poet himself does in every speech we not only see what his persons are during the scene represented but we are also made acquainted by some nice touches in each play with their former mode of thinking and acting and as no poet ever understood nature better in the operation of the passions so he always makes them speak and act in the highest conformity to their characters in this respect his genius and judgment is every where equal to horaces precept aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi mores  lears deportment and sentiments in regard to his daughters in the first act and what gonerill says of him to regan mark very plainly his character which is that of a haughty passionate inconstant weak old man he does not resign his authority to his daughters so much out of love to them as to rid himself of the cares of government  he retains the name of king with a suitable train of attendants  he still commands with his former impetuosity of temper and is jealous even of trifles this the ill natured character of the daughters will not suffer and they are in consultation in the most undutiful and unbecoming manner to deprive him of his remaining show of power their behavior and ingratitude soon appear in the most glaring instances and make the old king sorely sensible that he had given them all   nature was shakespeares guide he describes the imagination affected by concurring causes to pave the way for a scene of the highest distress  lear as a king and father feels with great sensibility the shocks of his daughters ingratitude and unnatural treatment and exhibits a moving picture of the feelings of the heart and the various conflicts of passions very expressive of his character and circumstances if the poet had nothing more in view he might have been well content with the masterly picture he has drawn of his distress grief and rage in every scene before the loss of his senses but he has crowned the distress by making him at last fix his imagination on his own rashness and folly in giving away his all and putting it out of his power to avenge himself and it is this reflection chiefly drives him to madness  the jesting of his fool wholly turns upon his unkinging himself and retaining nothing which lear minutely attends to and says a bitter fool  after gonerills proposal to reduce his train he breaks out woe that too late repents  then the ingratitude of his daughters and his own folly deeply strike him   o lear lear lear beat at this gate that let thy folly in and thy dear judgment out afterward he says to gonerill thou shall find that i will resume the shape which thou did think i have cast off for ever gone do you mark that in the next scene wrapped up in thought he says to take t again perforce  monster ingratitude in this line the two ideas are strongly blended and the loss of power foremost for surely that was the obvious reason of the insults he had received if he had still been in possession they would have continued to sprinkle him with court holy water the fool whose phrase the last is says fathers that wear rags do make their children blind but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind etc   i must here take notice of the different coloring used by our poet and all good writers in distinguishing the characters of men seemingly agitated by the same passions lears idea of his folly in divesting himself of his authority is nicely and artfully distinguished by shakespeare from that kind of regret which an imperious man of a different character would feel from the deprivation of power  he is full of the loss of his dignity only as it was the occasion of the ill treatment he met with and not from a thirst of rule  this idea and that of the ingratitude of his daughters which he feels as the consequence of it i cannot help thinking are as closely united in his madness as two twigs twisted together and growing out of the same stem  when he exclaims and reproaches his daughters in that heartpiercing scene of distress on the heath he says o regan o gonerill your old kind father whose frank heart gave all  o that way madness lies  let me shun that  no more of that    on his recollection that he gave all he breaks short and immediately subjoins o that way madness lies let me shun that no more of that  i e let me not think that i have been guilty of so much folly as to have given all to such ungrateful wretches  the reflection will make me mad  i know it may be insisted on by you and perhaps by many others that lear makes use of the sentiment of giving all only to tax the ingratitude of his daughters in a higher degree but it is possible you may be of a contrary opinion if you can allow that the moral of this play does not expose the ingratitude of children more than the folly of parents this same folly of parents is also touched with great judgment in the underplot of gloster and the characters of lears two daughters are finely contrasted with those of cordelia and edgar and the poets design in marking out so strongly the folly and illjudged partiality of parents is confirmed by the behavior of edmund   when lear sees the wretchedness of edgar he pursues the same train of reasoning which before possessed him and asks did thou give all to thy daughters  and art thou to come to this and immediately after what have his daughters brought him to this pass could thou save nothing  did thou give them all   this is agreeable to his character  and from all that we hear in common life for there are many stories of old weak parents who have acted much in the manner of lear and to the reproach of human nature have met with ingratitude and disobedience these i say in their feelinghours of distress are reported to have reproached themselves with their folly in giving all as well as exclaimed against the ingratitude of their children  there are many characters i doubt not now in the world who retain a heap of treasure useless to themselves from their children on no better motives than to insure their duty and attention and some who carry the moral of this play to a ridiculous height by denying their children an independance merely on the same parity of reasoning without considering the difference between the prudence of parents and their folly  i forbear making any quotations from lears speeches in his madness i think the whole obvious enough and that our immortal poet who had a perfect knowledge of the workings of the human mind has drawn both the ideas in lears madness agreeable to the representation he has made of him in the first act  what i have hitherto said is entirely confined to the different opinions of mr ranger and the adventurer nor do i expect that you shall alter yours in conformity to my judgment  let a diligent examination of the play determine you in the future criticisms you intend to give the public on this subject  what has often occurred to me in reading over the several editions of our poet and what has been said by you and many great geniusses only serve to convince me of the difficulty of any one mans succeeding in a perfect criticism on shakespeare at least i have reason to think so from what i have seen of the several attempts that have been made by different commentators from the time of mr row to the mutilated condition our poet was thrown into by subsequent editors  several persons have succeeded in illustrating many of the characters he draws and have pointed out to public notice many of his latent beauties but i believe there is scarce one man alive to speak in the style of a very extraordinary address to a great man in last saturdays inspector who is even capable of calling all his beauties by their proper names much less of exhibiting them all with advantage to the public whose property they now are if they will acquire a taste to enjoy em  i cannot forbear mentioning the obligation which the public has to the genius of mr garrick who has exhibited with great luster many of the most shining strokes of shakespeares amazing art and may be justly styled as he was once called by you his best commentator for it is certain he has done our poet more justice by his manner of playing his principal characters than any editor has yet done by a publication  i shall conclude with the same freedom as i began by desiring you will consider my manner of treating this subject as the mere hints of a friendly letter and not

in my two last papers entirely confined the attention of my readers to critical enquiries i shall make no apology for offering another essay this day upon a subject nearly connected with those matters the more especially as the honor of our country is in some sort concerned in the present lucubration against a french writer upon whom i have formerly animadverted and who has taken in some passages of his works unbecoming liberties with the english nation  prefixed to voltaires merope we find a letter to maffei the author of an italian tragedy on the same subject in which that writer after mentioning a faulty piece which was performed on the english stage delivers himself in the following words elle fut sans doubt mal reque mais nest il pas bien etrange quon lait representie nest ce pas une preuve que le teatre angloise nest pas encore epure il semble que la meme cause qui prive les angloise du genie de la painture and de la music leur ote aussi celui de la tragedy cette isle qui a produit les plus grand philosophes de la terre nest pas aussi fertile pour les beaux arts and si les anglois ne sappliquent seriensement a suivre les precepts de leurs excellens citoyens addison and pope ils napprocherent pas des autres peuples en fait de gout and de literature the english merope says voltaire acted in the year      was not well received but is it not surprising that it was exhibited at all may we not infer from thence that the english stage has not as yet attained a due degree of refinement it looks as if the same cause which has deprived the english of a genius for painting and music has also withheld from them the spirit of dramatic poetry that island which has produced the greatest philosophers in the world is not so happy with regard to the polite arts and unless they seriously attach themselves to the precepts of their excellent countrymen addison and pope they will be thrown at a distance by other nations in point of literature and productions of taste  because the managers of a theater suffered a bad piece to be represented is it not unfair to derive from thence a charge of indelicacy upon a whole nation more particularly when the reception this piece met with from the public is rather an indication of a correct and just taste   what the cause is which has deprived the english of a genius for painting and music i am at a loss to determine certain it is those arts flourished for a long time in italy before they came over the alps to our northern regions and it is certain that a taste for them has prevailed many years since in this kingdom they have been cultivated here with the greatest delicacy by several eminent masters though we cannot boast as many exalted geniusses as have adorned the softer clime of italy the transfiguration by raphael the nativity by corregio and the last judgment by michael angelo will perhaps never be matched any where else but it is unfair to deduce a conclusion from thence that we have no genius for this excellent imitative art in england portraitpainting has been in as great a degree of perfection in this country as in any other part of the world sir godfrey kneller found so much taste among us that he made this his own country and here  lely on animated canvas stole the sleepy eye which spoke the melting soul   but not to sneak from living worth to dead as mr pope finely expresses it whoever has observed with attention the performances of hayman must be convinced that voltaires charge of a want of taste is perfectly groundless every thing is put out of hand by this excellent artist with the utmost grace and delicacy and his historypieces have besides their beautiful coloring the most lively expression of character hutsons rooms teem with mimic life and hogarth like a true genius has formed a new school of painting for himself he may be truly styled the cervantes of his art as he has exhibited the ridiculous follies of human nature with the most exquisite humor and he may be said to be the first who has wrote comedy with his pencil his harlots progress and marriage ala mode are in my opinion as well drawn as any thing in moliere and the unity of character which is the perfection of dramatic poetry is so skilfully preserved that we are surprised to see the same personage thinking agreeably to his complexional habits in the many different situations in which we afterward perceive him the frible the bully the politician the lawyer the miser and in short all the striking characters in life are by this gentleman so admirably depicted upon canvas that i am convinced voltaire would be at a loss to show where he has been equalled by any of his countrymen   we may also boast an equal excellence in music for though mr handell is not an englishman it is however a convincing proof of our national taste that we have made it worth his while to fix his residence among us and that we have shown a due sensibility to manly melody where the sound is expressive of the sense and where no unnatural divisions nor idle insignificant quirks mislead the ear in a thrilling maze of wild and and random notes it is owing to the encouragement we have afforded this gentleman that we can now boast the noblest and most rational music in the world besides such a genius as doctor boyce will be always sufficient to vindicate us from voltaires national opprobrium and the admirers of arne have constantly celebrated him for his peculiar talent at finding the most emphatic expression in a composition and discovering where the passions are placed in every piece of poetry to these passages he never fails to give their full energy and like a ravishing commentator he brings new beauties into light with such a sweetness of harmony that every breast yields irresistibly to the melting impression i am proud to have an opportunity of saying that we are likely to have an english opera set to music by the last mentioned gentleman which i persuade myself will do honor to him and his country since the time when the above essay was wrote mr smith a pupil of mr handells has displayed a noble genius for musical composition and the success which his opera called the fairies met with on drury lane stage at once gives luster to his merit and is a proof of the public taste   with regard to dramatic poetry our advantage over every nation in the known world is i think very apparent the best critics have laid it down as a rule that a performance is to be judged by its number of striking beauties and not by some inaccuracies and the instances of occasional conformity to the vicious taste of the times if shakespeare is viewed in this light he will certainly appear to any unprejudiced reader infinitely superior to corneille racine and all the polished writers of france and italy i remember a passage in voltaires writings where he is at infinite pains to bring together a string of quotations from the best french tragedies to evince their great talents for the sublime in all he makes up about twenty or thirty at most and the beauties of shakespeare have of late been published in several volumes besides otway has found access to the heart better than any french writer whatever and the domestic passions are touched by him with the greatest elegance and simplicity it is very common on the french stage to hear a personage of the drama exclaiming perpetually helas and mon dicu and then formally acquainting the audience that he feels such and such sensations but our great masters of the passions make their hearers feel by sympathy the agitations of their heros breast without running into cold languid declamation  the dramatic poetry of this country is like our constitution built upon the bold easis of liberty and though the latter has brought our king to the block and the former admits blood to be shed on the stage these are corruptions which have intruded and are as the poets says effects unhappy from a noble cause upon the whole we may apply what horace has said to the english nation  spirat tragicum satis and feliciter audet sed turpem putat in chartis metuitque lituram   our poets are sufficiently possessed of the spirit of tragedy but they are not attentive to the minute rules of correct taste and the trouble of blotting it may be added that they have more real fire sublimer sentiments and characters better marked than any nation whatever and with regard to painting and music we can boast so many masters in both as might have prevented the french author from charging us with a want of genius and taste for the fine arts  i cannot dismiss this paper without observing that it is a very particular pleasure to me to find the subject on which i have been hitherto offering some scattered reflections touched upon with great spirit by a writer of acknowledged genius mr gathric in a preface to a novel called the friends he has expressed himself with great warmth and a noble national jealousy after mentioning that voltaire calls his countrymen the absolute legislators of all the fine arts in europe how shameless says he is this assertion in the face of a country that gave bread to holben dignities to reubens and encouragement to vandike and that for years before even by this writers own acknowledgment the national taste of france was formed while that taste was barbarous johnson enriched his native tongue with comedies wrought up to more than terentian regularity and propriety in point of conduct and while france was ignorant of almost every order of architecture inigo jones in england was rearing houses and projecting palaces which all the boasted improvements of france in that art have not yet equalled i shall forbear to urge the examples of spencer or shakespeare because i am firmly and seriously of opinion that no frenchman ever yet was able supposing him to understand english equally as french to taste the beauties of either of these poets for the truth of this i appeal to every englishmans sense who has had the misfortune to read the unwilling scanty starved and mistaken encomiums that voltaire has bestowed on shakespeare  is it not rather too charitable in the author of the foregoing passage to suppose monsieur voltaires reserved praises of shakespeare could arise only from an inability of relishing his beauties for my part i must avow it the french writer appears to me capable of feeling every stroke of our great poet but envy and a vain ambition of erecting himself into an imagined superiority have rendered him open and explicit in his abuses and hesitating and frigid in his commendations but to conclude what virgil has given away from his countrymen we claim for ours none better shall inform the breathing brass or soften marble into mimic features none shall better plead or with equal sagacity describe the motions of the planetary system and the laws of nature and besides it shall be our further praise to spare a vanquished foe and to check the encroachments of an intriguing faithless perfidious enemy ever restless and aiming at an universal monarchy which it is to be hoped the councils and arms of great britain will for ever hold from them  true intelligence drury lane jan         the tragedy of richard the third was performed here lately and as there were many circumstances in the battle which was fought in the fifth act quite unknown to the audience it may not be improper to give some account of that engagement the theatrical cock had done salutation to the morn and richard had animated

enemy setting up the warhoop he was repulsed into the greenroom where he rallied his spirits and his forces and again returned to the charge upon this the fight was renewed with great alacrity and continued very obstinate until a general desolation stretched the greatest part of the combatants upon the scene of action upon this occasion general raftor fell greatly lamented and if we may be allowed to imitate sallust the same absence of passion for which he was remarkable while living was legible in his countenance lord high constable gray was overpowered by numbers and his body was taken up far from his friends among fallen heaps of the enemy still breathing short and clinching his staff with the same eagerness he had done all his life lieutenant general mar fell much lamented

extraordinary this evening  numb    graysinn saturday feb        o rus quando ego te aspiciam quandoque licebit nunc veterum libris nunc somno and inertibus horis ducere solicitae jucunda oblivia vitae hor i lately met with a fable in a french writer which i thought carried with it a great deal of propriety and though it was rather eked out as is sometimes the case among the liveliest geniusses of that country beyond the just limits prescribed by the matter contained in it it was however conducted with such a prettiness of fancy and expression that i was very much entertained with the perusal of it poetry says my author is the son of the god of ease and the goddess of meditation he bears in his appearance such a strong resemblance to these his parents that it is impossible to mistake the marks of his legitimacy and therefore whenever these proofs of his birth are deficient we may with reason conclude him to be of a spurious breed  from his father he derives his apparent indolence his serenity his graceful elocution and his unlaboured turn of thought together with his elegant felicity in all his compositions a remarkable neglect of the ordinary uses of life a disregard for riches and a total absence of all worldly ambition save what is inspired by virtue and honest fame are his distinguishing characteristics from his mother he possesses his modesty which makes him not very fond of obtruding himself into company his pensive air which inclines him to be always enforcing some precept of morality or some topic which may be subservient to the use or enjoyment of life his love of solitude which induces him to shun crowds and great cities and leads him into rural scenes where he may give free scope to his imagination undisturbed by the cares and anxieties of life the same disposition in his temper renders him not very fond of being known by the bulk of mankind that he may prevent the inconveniences attendant on him when his affairs require that he should make his appearance in public if he puts any thing abroad into the world and thinks proper to publish the result of his contemplative moments he does not like to be pointed at by the multitude but chooses to receive the tribute of applause obtained by his writings without being liable to the sarcasms the taunts and malevolent jests which are always the sure concomitants of praise and which are generally a very great discount upon his happiness  from these motives he is enamoured with retirement and he is further confirmed in his sequestered state by a consideration that the more he keeps himself at a distance from the rest of mankind the more beauties they are willing to descry in his productions in like manner as the hills and the remote parts of a prospect present a more vivid green than when our advances to them have brought the scene more close to our inspection and the heath the craggy rock and ploughed land are familiarised to the naked eye  this is the substance of the fable the meaning that it inculcates is certainly very just and obvious the best writers in all ages have subscribed to it and the most applauded of the ancient poets are constantly offering warm pictures of rural imagery to our imaginations they seem to be stifled with dust and smoke when they mention a citylife and we frequently sind them expatiating with rapture upon the pleasures of a countrylife which they look upon to be the nurse of thought and the only sphere in which their studies can be prosecuted with any degree of success  the same observation will hold good with regard to all kinds of writing unless it be those excellent productions of the press which make their appearance under the various shapes of newgatememoirs newspapers and political pamphlets in works that call for a long train of reasoning subtle disquisitions and unwearied application undoubtedly the proper place to accomplish them is in those regions where riot and debauchery are strangers where gaming drinking and idle amusements of all sorts are unknown and where above all health and cheerfulness add new luster to the face of things  it may perhaps seem a paradox if i should assert that among all the gentlemen of the quill there is not one to whom solitude and ease are more necessary than the periodical writer but though his compositions are generally comprised in a narrow compass and though he does not for the most part pretend to search every subject to the bottom though it is not expected of him to lay before the reader deep philosophical speculations abstracted reasonings and new systems of morality and religion yet in my apprehension it will be found upon an attentive survey of his situation that it is particularly incumbent on the adventurer in this way to withdraw himself from the bustle of mankind and to appear as seldom as possible in little circles at coffeehouses convivial clubs at taverns and the long train of public places which serve no other purpose in this metropolis than merely to kill time as the phrase is and to hurry a person into a course of vanity and dissipation  there is a passage in mr pope which i have ever perused with admiration because it shows him to have been a man of the most prudent understanding as well as the most finished poet two adjuncts which are seldom found to coexist  i never with wits and witlings passed my days to spread about the itch of vulgar praise nor like a puppy daggld through the town to fetch and carry singsong up and down nor at rehearsals mouthed and sweat and cried with handkerchief and orange at my side i asked no homage from the race that write but kept like eastern monarchs from their sight and sick of fops and poetry and prate to bufo lest the whole castalian state perhaps too great a tincture of pride runs through these lines for any one else to make application of them to himself pope had talents superior to almost all mankind but if a more humble writer cannot withdraw himself from our present townsmarts and critics like an eastern monarch he may at least accomplish it like juvenals friend in his third satire who retired from rome to avoid its plagues and inconveniences   atque unum civem donare sibyllae it is possible my readers may think these tenets inconsistent with the character of ranger but airy and gay as ranger may appear he is now perfectly averse to the wild sallies of his namesake in the play he would not choose to stagger home from a box and dice in the morning nor to get through a window into an honest gentlemans house at night he cannot run after every white apron he sees nor keep company with a set of fellows whom he despises and yet there are dissipations to which a resident in town is for ever liable add to these the danger attendant on a writers making himself known in too many quarters of the town prejudices are ever apt to arise against an author who does not take care to conceal himself the transition is so quick from the performance to the person who produced it that from the moment a man begins to publish he is enlisted into a state of warfare with almost all the critics and malevoli of the age  some readers have no criterion by which to judge of a production except the rules of physiognomy and if an author appears younger than themselves they hold it absolutely impossible to receive any instruction from him it is by the way somewhat strange that this experienced class will not allow a man to be sit to entertain them until his imagination begins to flag his invention to close like flowers at the setting of the sun his memory to decay and his wit if he have any share of it to become slow and tardy this however is what is desired by the man who would look an author in the teeth to know his age and from thence make an estimate of his merit  qui redit ad fastos and virtutem estimat annis there is another set of people who make it their business to pry into a writers connections and thoroughly inform themselves of his attachments his friendships and his resentments according as these coincide with their own way of thinking they blame or approve even though the author is absolutely impartial in his animadversions there says one ranger is right  o d  n the fellow was ever such a position as this  my dear ranger that will not pass upon us  we know you are ptejudiced in this affair  and there again  you praise this man because you are intimate with him  did i not see you walk arm in arm with him the other night at the coffeehouse  in this manner is the person judged who attempts to run the dangerous career of wit as boileau expresses it du bell esprit la carriere epineuse and upon the whole i think it may be laid down as a maxim that no periodical writer should ever reside in this metropolis that he may effectually evade the censures of prejudice the blasts of detraction the envy of rival wit and the several avocations of a townlife it may be added that it is absolutely necessary that an author should never suffer himself to be known on account of the antipathy which will arise to his person patroclus conquered for a long time in the armor

with his religious tenets i have jugded it not improper to lay before my readers some particulars relating to this matter which i lately met with in a volume of the ingenious racine that excellent french author had it seems given vent to some animadversions on mr popes essay on man and the consequence was that our great poet uneasy at the reflection resolved to assert his system in a letter to the french writer which he enclosed to the celebrated chevalier ramsay this correspondence will throw a light on popes way of thinking in religious matters and will evidently show that he was far from embracing bolingbrokes principles as the sanction of so great a genius would in all probability greatly ferve the purposes of the noble writer it will in some measure defeat that end and convince mankind that mr pope thought the imputation of deism would blemish that fair fame of which he was enamoured and it may prove entertaining to the mere english reader to see what a polite intercourse was carried on between two geniusses of different nations strangers to each other and only connected by their wit and parts  a letter from the chevalier ramsay to m racine sir i was highly pleased and do not doubt but you will be pleased also at the receipt of a letter which mr pope has sent me to be forwarded to you you will perceive by the contents that it was not without just grounds i undertook in a former letter to justify the principles of my illustrious countryman my vindication of him might possibly be suspected to have its source in friendship and therefore lose greatly of its strength but here sir he pleads his own defense his letter will demonstrate to you his zeal for religion and it is to be hoped will silence his accusers you will find it accompanied by a defense of his system written by mr warburton a celebrated clergyman of the church of england mr pope by distributing this performance amongst his friends adopts the doctrine approves the sentiments and thereby gives to the whole an additional value  the opinion which you conceived of mr pope is on your side very excusable you received the impression from the misrepresentations of his enemies for many enemies he has urit enim fulgero suo etc his superior talents have excited a great deal of envy toward his person and his connections with several eminent personages all engaged in opposite interests or attached to the court have further served to inflame the minds of men against him but there are many evincing proofs of his probity and the incorruptibility of his principles  i have been informed that he was in intimacy with several successive ministers and often with many at the same time thus circumstanced it would have been easy for him to create a large fortune had he availed himself of the disgrace of one party in order to recommend himself to the other but he possessed a soul superior to such mean artifices  my intelligence adds further that the queen who was an admirer of his genius expressed an inclination to employ him without requiring any thing further of him than a dissembled conformity to the established religion of his country promising at the same time to dispense with the strictness of the oath usually administered upon such occasions but mr pope was inaccessible to temptation which may serve to prove he was directed by other principles than those of a skeptic or a deist  i must

to find that you impute several principles to me which i abhor and detest my uneafiness met some alleviation from a passage in your preface where you declare your inability from a want of knowledge of the english language to give your own judgment on the essay on man you add that you do not controvert my tenets but the evil consequences deducible from them and the drift of some passages in my poem which persons of notable sagacity imagine they have discovered this declaration is a shining proof of your candor your discretion and your charity i must take leave to assure you sir that your unacquaintance with the original has not proved more fatal to me than the imperfect conceptions of my translators who have not sufficiently informed themselves of my real sentiments though the many additional embellishments which my piece has received from the elegant version of m d r  have done an honor to the essay on man yet it has on the other hand suffered a greater injury from his frequent misapprehension of the principles it inculcates these mistakes you will perceive are totally refuted in the english piece which i have transmitted to you it is a critical and philosophic commentary written by the learned author of the divine legation of moses i flatter myself that the chevalier ramsay will from his zeal for truth take the trouble to explain the contents of it i shall then persuade myself that your suspicions will be effaced and i shall have no appeal from your candor and justice  in the mean time i shall not hesitate to declare myself very cordially in regard to some particulars about which you have desired an answer  i must avow then openly and sincerely that my principles are diametrically opposite to the sentiments of spinoza and leibuitz they are perfectly coincident with the tenets of m paschal and the archbishop of cambray and i shall always esteem it an honor to me to imitate the moderation with which the latter submitted his private opinions to the

hurried me away as i had often heard positions said to be yours or at least consequences resulting from your essay cited against certain truths which i now find you respect as much as myself i thought i had a right to enter the lists with you the passage in my preface was extorted from me by a degree of remorse which i felt in writing against you this remorse sir was awakened in me by the consideration that the greatest men are always the most susceptible of the truths of revelation i was really grieved to think that mr pope should oppose a religion whose enemies have ever been contemptible and it appeared strange that in a work which points out the road to happiness you should furnish arms to those who are industrious to misguide us in the research  your letter at the same time that it does honor to your character must bring a blush in my face for having entertained unjust suspicions but notwithstanding this i think myself obliged to make it public the injury which i have done you was so the reparation should be the same i owe this to you i owe it to myself i owe it to justice  whatever may be urged in your favor in the commentary you have sent me it is now rendered unnecessary by your own declaration the respect which you avow for religion is a sufficient vindication of your doctrine i will add that for the future those among us who shall feel the

those places by his grandmother he could not possibly conceive what could be the advantage of frequenting them doctor opium not a little picqued at this declaration thought proper on his part to mention that he knew as little of what passed within the walls of the church as the other but out of respect to many reverend dignitaries who were his extreme good patients he could not help thinking that those assemblies under proper management might be rendered a tolerable instructive amusement i grant you replied snakeroot if the managers would pay some little deference to the public taste and in these cases it ought to be consulted for it appears to me that preaching and playing had originally a pretty close affinity indeed i know nothing that can give a better idea of the simplicity of

with any degree of attention as i was yesterdaymorning perusing mr hawkins browns excellent poem upon the immortality of the soul in which he has artfully combined in their full force all the arguments in support of that important article of our belief suddenly i heard a violent bounce over my head the cieling shook as if ready to come down and a convulsion shook the whole house deep contemplation sometimes unbraces the nerves to such a degree that an unexpected noise startles the whole frame of the body and throws the spirits out of that placid state which is requisite in order to think with calmness and perspicuity this discomposure i experienced upon so many occasions and sometimes in such quick succession that i judged it proper to step up stairs to the gentleman to inform him of the inconveniences which i lay under and to beg of him to manage his affairs for the future with less turbulence  i knocked two or three times at his door but receiving no answer and hearing him run about with great violence of exertion i made bold to walk in unbid you go into the dining room through a glassfoldingdoor which was at this time shut but the curtains undrawn through the window i saw the gentleman pulling off his clothes with the utmost vehemence and in an instant he appeared in the habit and air of an old woman delivering doctor rocks bills upon ludgate hill surprised at this change i stopped short to observe the actions of this extraordinary personage and very shortly i was entertained with another vicissitude of appearance for quick as lightening he shifted clothes and walked about the room with a basket and with an audible voice pronounced muffins for coffee and tea gentlemen and ladies this appeared extremely whimsical he then varied his dress and with a silver pipe cried out londonevening post after which he threw away his bundle of papers fall down upon his knees laid his hand on his heart looked up with a great expression of joy and then rising indulged himself in all the whimsical vagaries of a man frantic with sensations too exquisite to endure in this way he continued for some time and at length threw himself into an attitude of surprise after which he ran wild about the room like one almost distracted with despair looking up in vain to heaven for relief when to my great amazement he unexpectedly mustered up his spirits and with great alacrity leaped through a small aperture into the coalhole after absconding there for a short space of time he came forth with a sack of coals upon his shoulders which he emptied in the middle of the room calling with some earnestness below he had no sooner done this but he directed his eyes sparkling with joy to some imaginary object with which his fancy seemed to be highly pleased he then came forward and knocked at the door where i had taken my station which i then took an opportunity to open and as i was advancing toward him he seized me by the shoulder and twining me round with all his strength sent me reeling into a corner of his room upon this he walked into the outward apartment slapping the door after him and immediately opened a small casement window which was over the door of his bedchamber from thence he stretched out his neck and looking me full in the face burst out into a loud fit of laughter then producing a squirt he began to let fly at me in such a manner that i was soon pretty well watered from head to foot the exclamations which i vented upon this occasion rung such a peal in the gentlemans ears that he was brought to a recollection of himself he came down very leisurely from his post and with a modest air and genteel address he politely asked my pardon and told me that he was so intent upon his business that he really did not perceive that he was offering indignities to a stranger   imagining that i was in the hands of a madman i was willing to acquiesce with his apology but to satisfy my curiosity i took the liberty to enquire of him the nature of his business and what might be his vocation sir said the gentleman will not you please to be seated with regard to my business sir i am a pantomime poet  a pantomime poet  pray sir what is a pantomime poet  to this question my friend answered with a smile a writer of pantomime sir  it is a plan which i have determined to apply myself to having reason to think that it is the only way of succeeding in the present age i was bred at eton school from whence at a proper time i was removed to the university at both which places i laid in a sufficient store of greek and latin and always feeling a particular turn for the drama i applied my genius principally to tragedy and comedy in each species of writing i have given the finishing hand to some pieces which have received the approbation of a few gentlemen of known taste and perfectly versed in critical matters encouraged by their opinion i came to town and after a long tedious application i find it impossible to get any of my performances exhibited mr garrick has already like a provident general laid his plan of operations and mr rich is determined to bring on no new pieces until we have such a genius as tom durfey i wish mr  says he we had such another writer now on this account i have taken a resolution to cultivate a species of the drama which cannot fail of being profitable to all parties and being agreeable to the public taste will be brought on without difficulty as soon as offered   here i broke in upon the thread of his discourse by asking if he was determined to become harlequin himself to this he answered me in the negative but as it is a rule in writing to place yourself in the situation of the character for which you are to find suitable dialogue he had judged it not improper to conform to this precept and therefore in order the better to concert the sudden escapes and changes of dress which have so pleasing an effect in this kind of poetry he was practicing over every striking attitude and every unexpected situation of the harlequin that he might be the better able to form an opinion of the plot and the several incidents of the mavelous which he had found it necessary to introduce he proceeded to inform me that he purposed calling his first piece harlequin triumphant or poetry in the suds in this performance the whole race of authors are to be exposed to the derision of the public and harlequin is to crack a very great number of facetious jokes upon their shoulders with his wooden sword a poet is to be placed at a table with a beefstake laid before him to his inexpressible joy when in an instant by some curious stroke of art the solid substance is to be changed into a modern tragedy and calverts entire butt wafted away from his longing eyes the bard after this is to be ducked in a well and then tossed dry in a blanket while mother dullness enjoys the sprightly vein of mirth happy to see her orders so faithfully executed in short the unhappy poets are to undergo every indignity that human wit can invent and in contrast to this harlequin is to riot in luxury the spring is to pour fourth her freshest verdure to charm his eye summer to ripen the various fruits upon the loaded boughs in order to regale his palate autumn must administer the circling glass and winter expand the frozen surface of the waters for him to skate with all his dignity in sight of the astonished audience  though this plan appeared highly romantic to me at first sight i could not help telling the gentleman that i made no doubt but he would find his account in it i told him that the surest way to rise in the world was to gratify the follies of the people and therefore commended this scheme which i am convinced cannot fail of success i just then hinted that if he could contrive to be less violent in his studies i should take it as a favor and after assuring him of my sincere wishes for all the encouragement his project deserves i took my leave and am at present tolerably quiet in my study not having above two or three alarms in a day which must be now and then expected from so vigorous and warm an imagination  true intelligence crown coffeehouse

and the inimitable strain of poetry which run through it i frequently read it with the most transporting pleasure and after finishing it i cannot but look down very much upon the degenerate state of poetry among the moderns for the strong nervous thought and natural expression they have substituted pretty conceit quaint phrases turns strokes and i know not what tending to a general depravity of taste among us filled with these thoughts i lately retired to rest when queen mab immediately appeared to me and from the mixture of ideas fluctuating in my mind she dressed up the following scene to my imagination  i thought she informed me that the intellectual regions are divided into districts similar to those of the netherworld so admirably described by the poet i then fansied that she commanded me to set out on a journey through the head of a modern writer which i instantly agreed to and the goddess accordingly took me in her chariot in a short time we arrived at the apartment where the bard sat sicklied over with the pale cast of thought at my first approach toward the intellectual regions a terrible effluvium proceeding as shakespeare has it from the heatoppressed brain struck my senses but i was soon diverted from that uneasy sensation by a personage who offered to be my guide from a conscious simper a careless disposition of his person and the tenor of his discourse i knew him to be vanity and accepted the compliment our way was through a thick skull of which we at once took possession and plunged into the abyss  at our first entrance a confused noise assailed our ears and we were instantly beset by a number of phantoms placed around the portal the god somnus lay stretched at full length diffusing round him lethargic vapors and stupid insensibility a group of wild dreams and reveries hovered over him and at a small distance flowed the river of animal spirits dull slow and lazy numbers were gathered round the banks begging a passage into this gloomy world but the charon of the place a torpid decrepid fellow known there by the name of perception gave a few of them a tardy admittance and to the greater part he was entirely deaf among those whom he rejected i perceived a train which i took for the nine muses but was informed they never had attempted to pass that way and upon a nearer view i found they were the amiable band of moral virtues who were highly desirous of gaining admittance which was refused them with the addition of as much insolence in the denial as if they had been suing at a great mans door they gave me to understand that it is now become fashionable to discard them every where at which i could not help expressing great uneasiness and i then advanced toward the boatman perception who with the help of his spectacles at length descried me and received me into his care  the river had a great many turnings and windings for ductile dullness new maeanders takes but after some trouble we at length reached the opposite bank an uncultivated tract lay before us dreary dark and gloomy no ray of light to break through the mist impenetrable obscurity involved the scene and vapors rolling over vapors made every thing an universal blot i pursued my journey with all possible expedition and arrived at the repository of ideas as it is here called the key of which was kept by memory as i supposed this to be a storehouse of universal knowledge i begged to be favored with a view of the several acquisitions he had made i desired he would produce some occult qualities of which i had no manner of notion and i called for several of the metaphysical train too tedious to enumerate in divinity i remembered several things of which i never could attain a clear conception and i have not arithmetic enough to recount the multitude of the mathematical species which i wanted the debates which i have heard in westminster hall gave me occasion to enquire for many of the legal band and i was curious after an infinite multitude of the parnassian tribe mentioned in a pompous style in several modern poets i longed to see an envenomed shaft taking its fatal aim wind wafting prayers on rosy wings to heaven etc i begged a sight of colley cibbers old friend battle array and the many other poetic beings which he and others of his brethren of the quill had created but all to no purpose  the next place we came to was the lugentes campi or the mournful fields sacred to venus i met with nothing here but cupids darts consuming fires and all the modern train of loves artillery as i was sufficiently acquainted with these from a constant and unwearied perusal of our modern tragedies and other poetical productions i hastened to the seat where judgment presided  judgment seldom made any decisions of his own but was biassed in all his decrees by several that surrounded him with so much authority that i supposed they were in the commission the chief of these was pride with a lofty air and supercilious brow which called to my mind the excellent remark in the essay on criticism of all the causes which conspire to blind mans erring judgment and misguide his mind which the weak head with surest biass rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools pope  next in place was ill nature callous and hardened to every gentle sensation of humanity and quite a stranger to that delicacy of elegant minds which beholds the merit of another with pleasure but on the contrary every thing shining with the smallest degree of luster is the object of his aversion and he is never pleased but with the misfortunes of his neighbors prejudice also seemed to have no small influence with the court and venality with itching palm frequently gave a new turn to every thing being ready to engage on either side in politics to abuse a worthy character in satire or exalt a base one in dedicatory panegyric  from these principles i could easily imagine to myself what kind of opinions were likely to arise and therefore hastened toward elysium in my way i perceived a desolate tract which may be called the region of tortures here i saw grief despair envy revenge and all the agonizing cares that made this place worse than what the poets fable of their tartarus in one part was to be seen ambition falling back like the stone of sisyphus in another place hunger was tantalized with the hopes of a supper but the worst of fiends cruel want forbids the touch here stood a pillory with defamation nailed to it by the ears there a blanket stretched out and a bard going to be tossed in it  here a tumultuous playhouse at

 had i all the pens of all the scriblers of the age i should not be able to relate every occurrence in my adventures and i was by this time admonished by my guide that we were arrived at the seat of happiness here we found invention happy in a review of all his airy beings that were fluttering round him in a variegated dress pressing and crowding upon each other as if to force a passage into open day i stood for a time wondering at this mighty bustle and then enquired what might be the cause of it to which invention that bright band which you behold so eagerly gathering about the gates of life are the chosen few to whom apollo has appointed a new birth into the world and they are now impatiently waiting till proper bodies are prepared for them by those poetical midwives commonly called booksellers they were all in the beginning wasted over by perception whom you have seen and were thence conveyed to the repository of ideas in the care of memory till in the various course of human contingencies they are again called forth and by my skill arranged in proper order for their appearance among the sons of men  thus having said he led me round the whole extent of elysium gave me a complete view of all his intellectual train and at length dismissed me through the ivory gate to breath the vital air to which i was highly pleased to find myself restored and the joy occasioned by this reflection operated so strongly on my spirits that i felt myself in some agitation and was instantly wakened out of my dream  true intelligence to charles ranger esquire sir as you are

advices from several routs in this metropolis we are informed that the beau monde has undergone within these few years a total revolution and that love is entirely banished from every bosom the men no

several hearings that have passed there this week   the proceedings of the court of censorialenquiry on the commission of oyer and terminer and general goal delivery held for the cities of london and westminster about nine oclock the judges took their seats and the jury consisting of the following persons were sworn and impannelled  thomas thimble an eminent haberdasher of smallware john rhubarb

was indicted for that he on saturday night the   th of february went into the middle gallery at drury lane playhouse and from thence one apple value a farthing on the stage did fling to the great annoyance of the actors and disturbance of the company the fact was proved by two undeniable evidences who being interrogated whether they had not the freedom of the house severally answered that they had not and added that they did not even go in with an order and that their only motive for appearing on the occasion was to bring to condign punishment an offender against the respect and good manners due to a public assembly whereupon the prisoner being asked by the court what he had to say for himself made answer that he was drunk and as he hoped to be saved it was nothing but an innocent frolic guilty upon which he was ordered to wait upon the managers of the abovementioned theater to ask their pardon for his misbehaviour and he was sentenced to drink but a pint of wine after his dinner for the future   sir peter jessamy was indicted for standing between the scenes in such a manner as to hurt the most pathetic situations of the drama guilty but it appearing to the court that it was not done with malice prepense but only with intent to display his clothes to the ladies he was dismissed without any other punishment than a severe reprimand and an order that he should not be admitted behind the scenes again without giving security for his good behavior of which mr varney and mr crudge are to take proper notice   elizabeth the wife of john gayless esquire was indicted for that she not having the love of her husband before her eyes has for the space of three years past obstinately wilfully and urged on by the instigation of a certain fury called gaming addicted all her attention to cards to the great pecuniary detriment of her husband and the utter extinction of all domestic happiness etc  the cause was opened by counselor manly who urged in a long harangue that it is an absolute apostasy from all that can be counted elegant in the fair sex to spend a life over a pack of cards that such a conduct can only serve to spoil their complexions disturb their tempers suppress the natural affections which alone can create conjugal felicity that it must inevitably put to flight the loves and graces which would otherwise hover round them and in their stead surround them with a band of harpies such as suspicion mistrust vexation disappointment etc and that in short it must at last bring on such an insensibility as to render a woman capable of venturing a daughters portion upon the turning up of a die and oblige her to surrender her lovely person in case of nonpayment upon an habeas corpus from the court of venus  after this betty minnikin chambermaid

deposed that he had served the lady ever since her marriage and that he knew no more of the color of her money than of the real color of her face though he was informed by her husband and he verily believed the same to be true that she had been supplied occasionally with money to discharge all her bills  the defense the prisoners council proved to the court that their client always preserved her virtue and that no instance of infidelity to the marriage bed could be charged against her even though she had been tempted by lord trumpabout who offered to remit a considerable gaming debt for so small a consideration as cuckolding her husband and upon this they rested their defense  to this it was replied by the council for the prosecution that it is not enough for a woman to preserve her virtue if she is insensible to shame in every other point agreeably to the statute  th young some modern ladies think one crime is all can women then no way but backwards fall lord townleys case was also cited by which it appeared a matter of indifference whether a man be cuckolded by a black ace or a powdered beau whereupon the jury without withdrawing brought in their verdict guilty and the

as not answering when called nor shutting the roomdoor after him and when bid doing it in such a manner as to shake the whole house etc the fact being proved the prisoner was asked what he had to say

more vails nor that  it is not the pay of a country curate  lord bless her she may get some raw boy to live with her but it will not do for me  upon this the jury declared him guilty and the court

not always in the same humor but why dont you take care to correct the press when you should be attending to that necessary trouble you are often running about the town which is no excuse to the

non populi fasces non purpura regum flexit and infidos agitans discordia fratres aut conjurato descendens dacus ab istro non res romanae perituraque regna nec ille aut doluit miserans inopem aut invidit habenti virg the stoic philosophy was by many of the ancients esteemed the height of human wisdom the sure road to happiness and the last finishing and apotheosis of an exalted character its excellence consisted not in the due government of the passions but in extirpating them totally from the human heart by which means the seat of feeling and source of every exquisite pleasure as well as tender pain was rendered quite callous and insensible and suffered to move only with the flux and reflux of the blood without being agitated with any kind of sensation whatever our excellent poet has given us a very picturesque description of this notable system of philosophy  in lazy apathy let stoics boast their virtue fixed it is fixed as in a frost contracted all retiring to the breast but strength of mind is exercise not rest how an absolute repugnance to the laws of nature and the want of those feelings which are the best ingredients in our composition can in any way constitute an exalted character i am at a loss to determine vita secundum naturam a life conformable to the laws of nature is tullys definition of a moral as well as an happy state certain it is all elegance of mind and relish for virtue must arise from those sensations which nature has implanted in us as excitements to action and inlets for due degrees of pleasure and pain without these our most refined gratifications must suffer a considerable abatement the pleasing anxieties of virtuous friendship the grateful solicitude of love the melancholy luxury of tender compassion and the delights which we derive from a wellwrought scene of distress in an affecting tragedy must all lose their influence and the mind sink into a dull state of insensibility for my part i have always had a sovereign contempt for the unfeeling pedantic wisdom of those unnatural followers of a brutal philosophy nor could i ever admire their ridiculous ostentation of a towering superiority of soul that this is also the sense of the greater part of mankind is very visible from that soporific awe with which they behold personages of this cast when interwoven into the drama while characters of a mixed nature in whom the passions are in a beautiful struggle between virtue and vice are always sure to seize the affections of an audience and interest every heart in the fortunes of the hero thus represented  virgil has transmitted to us a picture of the completion of that happiness which was the exalted boast of the stoics in the words of my motto he tells us that the person whom he describes in the possession of true felicity is never touched with popular esteem or the dazzling splendour of the regal state that difference between brothers conspiracies against his country or the decline of the constitution never disturb his breast nor is he ever made uneasy by compassion for the indigent or envy toward the great this is a character totally different from the amiable sketch by his brother poet of the man who considers the relations in which he stands to society and feels for all mankind the negative enjoyments above described can result from nothing but an absolute indifference to our fellow creatures and is so far from being commendable that in my opinion it is equalled by every debauchee in town i was lately in company with one of this class who appeared to me to be a very great proficient in the stoic philosophy and to have carried into his practice every branch of the foregoing system and as a further instance of the excellence of the stoic school i shall here present my readers with a character of a modern stoic philosopher  jack wildair is possessed of a fortune which might enable him to live with splendour or to prosecute any enterprise in the service of his country he has also the advantages of birth to render him reputable in the eye of the world but like a true philosopher he never placed any value upon these happy circumstances with a noble contempt for riches he squanders away his substance in a manner which shows him to be above the mean ambition of popular applause and instend of being arrogantly elated with the thoughts of his high birth he has been known to associate with the lowest of mankind so superior is he to those little sensations of pride which might be apt to play about the heart of a man of worldly vanity contented in his own mind he never condescended to court the favor of his countrymen at an election for member of parliament the populi fasces have never had any attraction for jack wildair and so little is he touched with the splendour of majesty that he does not care for any king in europe while all our politicians have made the two brothers the constant object of their attention he is little sollicitous whether there be a difference between them or not the fortifications of dunkirk the depredations of the spaniards in the west indies upon our merchantmen the election of the king of the romans the equipment of french fleets and all the other points of moment which engross the thoughts of our present race of patriots never once discomposed the serenity of his mind liberty and property are to him unideal sounds and if magna charta were burned by the common hangman it would not occasion the least gloom in our heros soul he can also behold the distresses of the indigent the corroding anxieties of poverty most stoic like without a single sigh nec doluit miserans inopem and so far from being envious of anothers superiority in life while he is easy himself he never was yet known to compare his own situation with any man above him though he has now and then condescended to cast a look beneath him with no small degree of satisfaction  nor does the firmness of wildairs mind rest here he can visit all the brothels in this metropolis without feeling the least degree of uneasiness he can behold undisturbed by any of those tender touches which might agitate weaker breasts an elegant form and the most beautiful set of features falling a prey to insamy diseases and prostitution and as the ancient worthies thought it a noble achievement totally to forget the man in order to raise their philosophic fame to an higher degree of eminence so our modern stoic can fat press the natural affections and in the rake he can also forget the man jack wildair is a very roman in that point he is an excellent practitioner of horaces golden rule to admire nothing and if confined to the ped of sickness to repair the waste made by folly and intemperance he is sure to spend his time in a series of moral reflections he wisely observes that all pleasure is fugitive that the reversion of pain falls to every mans lot and that the condition of human life is frail and uncertain when his health returns he indulges in all the sallies of his wild imagination to show that like aristippus he can adapt himself to every situation in short jack wildair has upon all occasions a true philosophical turn and indeed in all occurrences of life every thing is sure to suggest to him those reflections which are most conducive to secure his own happiness to prevent the ruffled state arising from conflicting passions to preserve the even tenor of his thoughts to reconcile him to himself and enable him to possess his soul in ease tranquillity and cheerfulness  this character of a modern town philosopher contains in my opinion all the branches of the much boasted stoic system and all the leading principles of happiness which it inculcates are carried by our modern academic to a much greater height of wisdom and felicity than they ever were by the most rigid follower of the stoic academy in so much as the modern hero grafts his happiness on the passions which he plays against one another and in that sense may be said to live secundum naturam whereas the ancient stoic endeavored to subvert the very elements of our being and among that sect he was the most exalted worthy who was the most divested of humanity  true intelligence bedford coffeehouse march   since the profession of buckism is grown into such repute a bard who boasts himself a descendant of the same facetious

remained in the chambers over my head ever since but the fervor of his enthusiasm being a good deal abated he has proved a very peaceable and quiet neighbor for though he cannot entirely refrain from his peripatetic lucubrations he is however careful to conduct them with a degree of temperance and he now proves a companion of very singular and entertaining oddities the other morning he paid me a visit and was contented in the beginning to converse with me upon common and ordinary topics upon which he discoursed with sufficient sedateness at length he took occasion to introduce the subject which was the cause of his visit and i observed that the moment he touched upon his favorite scheme of thinking he betrayed several whimsical gestures and an extraordinary manner of address sir says he i have taken the liberty to intrude upon you this morning in order to consult you in relation to a work which i have had in hand for some time past and which i think cannot fail to be of public utility as it is one of the desiderata in literature and a species of criticism likely to be productive of singular advantages to the learned world the thing i mean sir is the art of pantomime which i propose to publish by subscription not noubting but i shall meet with suitable encouragement to prosecute so arduous a task and if mr ranger will be kind enough to favor me with his recommendation i shall for the future esteem him as a generous promoter of the polite arts  in order to be able to comply with my friends request and to serve him as effectually as my small abilities will permit me i desired him to explain to me at large the plan of his undertaking and the whole method which he had chalked out to himself for so noble a work upon which i was informed that he intends to execute his design in imitation of aristotles art of poetry divided into as many sections and as near as the nature of the subject will admit comprised under the same heads his first chapter is to set out with an account of the imitative arts in which pantomime will be proved to be superior to all the rest having the greatest variety of gesticulation and the most expressive significance in all its attitudes and actions in the next section it will appear what sort of persons and things are proper for imitation and that the pantomime poet must either attach himself to the representation of personages above the ordinary race of human nature such as magicians enchanters genii gods imps and monsters devils furies etc or to the exhibition of characters to be met with in the ordinary occurrences of life such as we find introduced in harlequin ranger then follows a dissertation upon the proper manner of imitating and enquiry into the origin of pantomime tracing it from the time of herace down to the glorious time of mahomet carathra  after this our author proceeds to examine into the nature of farces and shows how they differ from the pantomime he then enters more minutely into the laws of pantomime and gives an account of it is several parts among these the fable is first considered and it is allowed it may be either simple or implex he does not totally reject the former but insists principally upon the beauties of the complicated plot such as harlequin sorcerer or the loves of pluto and proserpine harlequin fortunatus being of the simple kind consisting of one action only impeded or accelerated by several incidents all tending in a direct line to the completion of the whole  the refined beauties of the art offer themselves next and our author exhausts all his erudition all his rhetoric and all his whole stock of criticism to point out the advantages arising to a piece from a well conducted peripetia which he defines in these words the pantomimical peripetia consists in sudden changes of fortune arising from a concatenation of incidents highly improbable in their nature then the agnitio is displayed at large and proved to be the liveliest beauty in this species of the drama it being a sudden recollection in the personages of the piece when after a long absence they recognize and know each other again as when harlequin finds access to his colombine in a disguised appearance she by some token discovers her lover and is happy in his embrace  after having enforced these striking particulars he delivers rules for the excitement of terror pity and the mavelous the two former he mentions but slightly not thinking them essential in these compositions but in the mavelous he observes consists the utmost effort of human genius and then enumerates the various means by which it is excited such as flying mercurys ropedancers kicking straws children playing on the flute storms of rain thunder and lightening etc  the next division of the work relates to the manners of each personage of the drama in which he recommends a serious attention to character in order the more forcibly to unfold men and manners and the customs the intrigues the flights and descents of the gods with the whole history of the heathen mythology in this part of the work he expatiates at large upon the use of machinery and i make no doubt will greatly excel the celebrated bossu in this part of the performance having the interests of the theater greatly at heart our author proves that no playhouse can long subsist without a good set of carpenters an expeditious band of scenedrawers excellent candlesnuffers fireeaters trapdoormen ostriches monkeys serpents and the whole animal world besides a race of beings never seen upon the face of the earth  the sentiment comes into consideration in the following chapter the several modes of the mind are explained in an ample manner and directions given to the performer to render himself perfectly acquainted with the operation of all the passions on the whole frame of the body and it is laid down as a rule that he must be careful to mark the different actions of begging commanding threatening interrogating answering that he may be able to impress a lively idea of each upon the minds of his spectators  the sentiment being established the diction claims our next regard under this head the several pretty pieces of poetry introduced into pantomimes are criticized and proper rules prescribed for writing these kind of nonsense  verses to the whole work is annexed a particular examen of harlequin fortunatus in order to give a specimen of the great utility and truth of the foregoing rules i shall therefore conclude this paper with an abstract from this part of the work  there cannot says my author be sound in any pantomime writer a better imagined opening for the drama than the first incident in this piece the scene discovers a large wood in which the poor forlorn harlequin is wandering in a violent storm of rain thunder and lightening in a fit of desperation he throws himself on the ground and to heighten our compassion poor madam fortune is introduced bemoaning her condition in a very pathetic strain of poetry the amiable character of fortunatus is seen in his readiness to assist the distressed and the sequel conveys a fine moral viz that riches riot and debauchery are the most desirable things in this world as the piece ends with harlequins being in the full enjoyment of all his wishes the farmers yard affords a pleasing image of rural happiness and the beautiful incident of the dogs biting the clown conveys this incident that a dogs obeyed in office and it serves further to enforce the necessity of an act of parliament to lessen the number of dogs which overrun the kingdom to the great annoyance of his majestys loyal subjects the frequent remembrances between columbine and her harlequin make upon all occasions an admirable agnitio and the sudden changes of their fortunes form a very beautiful peripetia harlequins escape into the oven his running up the chimney and his leap over the gateway when his enemies are in close pursuit of him are all touches of the highest elevation and genius and upon the whole we may say with mr dennis that this piece is admirable for its fine moralities its universality and its integrity  true intelligence

them i liked it as if heaven and earth was coming together but at the second i no more cared for it no no more nor an oyster is like an eggshell for my own share on it i had rather hear ellinaroen than all their quivers and carolun was a better composer than any italian of them all   president time sir   mr macflummery what is it   president time sir   mr macslummery time what would you have one speak in time like those shefellows of singers there   president pray gentlemen dont laugh  pray be silent gentlemen  your five minutes are out sir   macsluummery is that all give me that porter there  here is my service to you and i will tack a sentiment to it  here is all honest hearts and sound bottoms   president pray gentlemen dont laugh do  be silent gentlemen  does any gentleman there choose to speak  mr macpherson it is with you   mr macpherson i do not know whether the gentlemans rasoning be reet about mr carolun but this i cun say that one of ramsays compositions set by the philharmonic society at dumferlin would make muckle entertainment and by fare exceed the squeaking of those eunuchs who are in my opinion a disgrace to society i remember master deenis in his book has many ideas on this subject deleevered with muckle oratory and i would rather at any time see the exhebeetion of the dramatic piece of the scotch ballad given in the haymarket two years elapsed since than have a dozen operas exhebeeted for nothing   president time sir   mr macpherson sits down and speaks the highland language which mr macflummery answers in irish president pray gentlemen be silent gentlemen as to my opinion on this subject i has but little to offer and i hope that the proposer of the question will give us some arguments against the operas which will militate stronger than those which has been already offered mr manly it is now with you sir   mr manly sir i am against operas for this capital reason viz because most of them are composed by people ignorant of the first principle of composition which is counterpoint or the art of placing different notes sounding together in true harmonic order music sir consists of melody and harmony melody is the regular progression of a single part and harmony of different parts united now the melody of all the songs in our late italian operas is extravagant and unnatural consequently unpleasing and sitter for instruments than voices their singers are constantly endeavoring to surprise by which means their songs are all quirks and divisions and the performers are sometimes squeaking like cats at the top of a house and sometimes growling like dogs in a cellar the energy of the words is totally neglected and the passion is entirely lost and therefore i cannot help wondering that while we have handel arne boyce and smith etc the english will lavish sums upon a false and depraved taste merely to be thought judges of what they do not understand i shall finish sir with asserting that an elegant drama by a good author and the music composed by either of the masters mentioned already might be a high and rational entertainment it would certainly save an immense sum to the nation and would excite some new geniuss to study and excel all other nations in manly sensible compositions where the sound would be an echo to the sense and the passions would be agitated by the joint power of poetry and harmony   president gentlemen it is now too late and so i wish you all a goodnight adjourned   numb    graysinn saturday april  0      mendici mimi balatrones hoc genus omne hor there is not a word in the whole compass of the english language more grossly abused than the term friendship which at present means no more than that men eat together walk together game together und are grave and merry drunk and sober together without ever conceiving any real regard for each others happiness and interest i believe every days experience will point out many who are dupes to this florid outside of friendship in the course of my observation i have marked out a particular character that falls more egregiously into this error than the rest of mankind the character i mean is that of the comical fellow or the agreeable devil or the cursed high fellow or the man of infinite humor or the genius or by whatever name for many names will suit him you may please to distinguish the person whom a cheerful flow of spirits and a quick circulation of the ideas that fall to his share conspire to render an entertaining companion  the comical fellow is in high request among all his acquaintance and different parties at the shakespeare the bedfordarms the kingsarms etc are vying with each other to have him the master of the joke in their convivial parties because he is without doubt the finest creature in the world to kill an hour with the merry droll has such variety of chat and such a deal of humor in telling a story but while this son of gaiety and wit is thus happy in the caresses of all the lovers of mirth this secret misfortune attends him that he has not any where procured himself the least degree of esteem because it is too well known that he has not a single virtue under the sun that he would at any time according to the common saying rather lose his friend than his joke that no obligation can bind him but that indiscriminately he lashes all alike and is constantly upon the look out for some incident which by a perversion of circumstances or by a few touches of mimickry or some other adventitious aid may be worked up into a story for the entertainment of the next company he goes into on this account the agreeable devil is held in utter contempt but the vivacity of his imagination will not afford him leisure to attend to this his vanity is fully gratified by the general applause he meets with and he is constantly exhausting his scanty finances in keeping company with a set of people who are good humoured enough to be perpetually entertained with his jokes   i will venture to affirm that few evils are more epidemic than this rage of being an highfellow and i am apt to think that many of those bankruptcies which fill the columns of the gazette are not entirely owing to losses in trade but to the pitiful ambition of discovering a fine vein of humor when once the sober cit becomes the ringleader in wit and frolic festivity when once he has learned to elevate and surprise his shop assumes a gloomy aspect bookkeeping is but a dull employment unfit for men of ner senfations and instantly his fervid imagination conveys him to the gentleman and porter then he cracks each joke over again and thrice he enjoys the laugh and thrice repeats the pun but in a little time his name is inserted in the gazette with a whereas his former companions shake their heads and are very sorry for it he was a wag a merry man a comical fellow  but business is a serious thing  poor jack spatter  he is at present the most remarkable of all the agreeable devils i have ever known jack does not want a share of native humor and he dresses up a story at second hand with such additional touches that a man is frequently as much entertained as if he had never heard it before or if he himself had not told it to him the very day besore for it is often the dverting rogues way unwittingly to fasten with something cursea high upon the very person who at first supplied him with the subject and then the genius is such a mimick  well to be sure nothing can escape him a cat a dog a monkey a manager a burlettagirl a woodward a garrick all must undergo the touches of his humourous imitation and mean while the company whores waiters and all do so laugh and so shake their side that life is quite flat and insipid without jack spatter but in this world where as moliere says on done rien pour rien where every thing must be paid for it cannot but prove very expensive to be thus aspiring in company but jacks vanity extends to expense as well as wit and humor how many shifts have i known him to make that he might display his vivacity at the tavern  a turtlefeast was sometime since fixed at the kings arms in cornhill and spatter was invited to make one a turtle feast says jack very well  it cannot be better  citizens laugh heartily when their bellies are full  i will certainly go  but how to pay my reckoning  there is titlepage the bookseller  he likes a touch of my humor  he will tip me two guineas for an epilogue  i will write him one  let me see what is here  drydens miscellany  i will transcribe one from this  no sooner said than done for jack has quick parts and away he sets out toward fleetstreet meets his friend humdrum at temple bar reads the piece to him to show what a comical devil he is humdrum admires it jack forgets that he stole it and admires it more touches two guineas from title page and who but he at the turtlefeast a masquerade requires somewhat a larger capital egad say jack i will write a pamphlet for that and touch five guineas  to work he falls and finishes his piece in the space of one morning though it cost the original authors from whom he compiled it many nocturnal vigils a jant to tunbridge in the summer season with some lovers of wit and humor could not but be agreeable to mr spatter and so instantly he sets down and writes a farce and because fieldings coffechouse politician is not very likely to be acted again on either of our stages what does the merry wag do but he takes the character gives it a new name makes a little alteration in the scene where the politician reads the newspapers and instantly genial jacob and a warm third day as the poet has it equips the genius for tunbridge thus is the cursed high fellow the amiable fripon perpetually spending the income of his brain and torturing his invention in endeavors to live with those who have fortunes to supply their expenses and who do not entertain the least symptom of friendship toward their merry companion what will become of him when he has played all his tricks i tremble to think and as if his misfortunes were now present i cannot help crying out alas poor yorick  i knew him a fellow of infinite jest  where be your gibes now your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar  quite chopfallen  but my fancy has pictured this scene of distress so strongly to me that i could wish some means could be devised to avert the impending evil an ingenious gentleman whom i have the pleasure of knowing proposed some time since a scheme for an hospital for decayed polts suppose in imitation of this laudable design an hospital were to be raised for decayed comical fellows for my part i cannot but think the plan should meet with general encouragement and i will willingly give the profits of this paper no    toward carrying it into execution mr garrick and mr rich will i dare say contribute on their parts an annual benefit toward this charity the objects of which may be admitted as follows  it being certified to us that the bearer  ab was an agreeable devil and entirely ruined himself by endeavoring to keep company with men of fortune who countenanced him merely as their jester you are hereby directed to admit the said unhappy pleasant creature into the hospital for decayed comical fellows london  signed by two directors should this proposal take effect i shall rejoice at being instrumental in the redemption of so many diverting creatures from utter misery for surely it would be melancholy to reflect that he who often enlivened even the sprightly champain might become miserably witty in an alehouse or be a joking bootcatcher at an inn and tell your honor a story while he is divesting your legs of their leathern encumbrance i shall therefore hope that all true lovers of humor will promote the scheme just hinted for the sake of those who ruin themselves for their pleasure and i shall be highly pleased that there will be a receptacle for poor jack spatter and that the agreeable devil may in his old days find repose in the hospital for decayed comical fellows  true intelligence court of censorial enquiry april    this day came on a remarkable trial in this court in which the muffinman the watchmen etc etc etc were plaintiffs and  shuter comedian at the theater royal in covent garden defendant upon an action brought against the said shuter for damages suffered by the plantiffs at a public exhibition on wednesday evening last when they were all taken off as it is called with such lively touches of mimickery that the audience was kept in a constant burst of laughter to the very great uneasiness of the said plaintiffs the jury being impanelled counselor blunderbuss opened the cause in a very vehement speech he inveighed severely against stage players and urged it was a very great hardship that honest and worthy characters should be converted into ridicule by the buffoonery of an impertinent player for his part he would take upon him to say that his clients were persons of known integrity probity and honor and he thought them more valuable characters in life than any set of comedians whatever  the muffinman he insisted was so reputable and worthy a personage that nothing but the height of insolence could induce a mimic on the stage to attempt to hurt him in his reputation if these things are permitted he could not determine where the thing would end and he himself he added might be treated in the same sort he therefore prayed that the gentlemen of the jury would take the premises into consideration and award suitable damages he then proceeded to call his witnesses  william topewell sworn i live near temple bar i saw the prisoner at comuss court and he was so diverting that i took two tickers for myself and my wise i could have swore as how it was our watchman that was speaking and i also heard the muffinman very distinctly and my wife did the same and i thought it very misbecoming that honest folks should be brought to shame in that public manner   elizabeth sugarkey i was sent with a good character from the registeroffice to live in a sober quiet family and with much ado  lord bless me i never had so much trouble in my life about any thing  mrs molly was waiting for me till almost one oclock before we could set out  and so at last we went and we got places near the door in the piazza and there we waited till the house was opened and then there came such a crowd of fellows that it was with much ado we got in at all  and when we did get in they placed us on the stage  well sure i never was so ashamed in all my born days  i thought i looked as impudent as any actress among them  and at last the prisoner came on the stage and as he was passing by he said to me you had better take off your pattins miss saucyfellow  and so be began to mimic the muffinman and it was the very same person that serves my mistress with muffins   the defense mr shuters council owned the fact but offered many arguments in mitigation they insisted it could not be of any material detriment to the plaintiffs even allowing that they were mimicked why theresore then continued the council i cannot perceive gentlemen of the jury that my client  a  has  incurred so severe a penalty because why  it was not done with an evil intent  and  a  my client has but followed the example of mr garrick who formerly availed himself of his talents for this species of acting and took very pleasant liberties with all the actors on the stage as did likewise  a  mr  foot who called it if i remember right giving chocolate why therefore then all that is to be said in the present case is  a  that  my client gentlemen of the jury has given chocolate to the muffinman  upon this the jury withdrew and in a few minutes brought in their verdict notguilty whereupon the court dismissed mr shuter with honor and told him if he does but endeavor strenuously to exert his comic powers with a close eye to nature he cannot fail to be an excellent comedian

to litterary amusements they endanger their lovely features and run a risque of dimming the sparkling luster of the eye on the contrary a page or two in a morning may serve to adjust the countenance

one object to another is an essential requisite in a wellformed understanding and surely nothing can better help to prevent the mind from dwelling too long upon any habitual set of ideas which may

the surest method to form a sound understanding and to preserve the judgment free and undistempered mr pope in his essay on criticism a poem in which good sense and poetry are beautifully combined has given this observation the sanction of a maxim for fools admire but men of sense approve in our greener years indeed when the young affections are to use the poets phrase tremblingly alive all over when every object presents itself in some new and striking attitude fond adimration may be then allowed to gaze and each incident in the scene of life may call forth the juvenile expressions of wonder and astonishment but surely when we become somewhat hackneyed in the ways of men when habit has coated over that quickness of sensation which attends the raw and inexperienced mind the elevated brow of amazement may be expected to subside to the sober cast of reflection and knowledge i am at present acquainted with a gentleman who has made so many sensible animadversions on the various occurrences of life that i am convinced nothing can arrive to excite in his breast any emotions of surprise and i have often heard him say very humorously lord i have already known so many unexpected turns and revolutions of things that were i to see the monument walk down cheapside and take out st pauls church to dance a minuet it would make no manner of impression on my spirits no more than when i read that it will be high water at london bridge at half past ten  but in the general mass of life there is such a lamentable inanity in the minds of most people and the gross of mankind are so scantily furnished with ideas that there are but few who when taken from their manual occupations or their other business do not fall into a sluggish oscitancy for want of a sufficiency of matter to employ their intellectual faculties thus by an habitual remissness in reviewing the ordinary notices of things the power of arranging and comparing our ideas in their manifold relations to each other which we commonly call judgment lies indolently dormant and the consequence is that upon every emergence the idle passions of astonishment take possession of the soul it is observable that this disease is not always confined to the unenlightened part of mankind but we may sometimes perceive this mental debility among those who from their education and from their intercourse with the world might be expected to be somewhat more solid there are perhaps in the circle of my own acquaintance at least half a score persons possessed of talents capable of extensive discernment and of thinking very justly upon any ordinary topics of conversation and yet through an habit of inattention such a total relaxation unstrings their intellectual powers that they in fact appear to have impotently pinned their faith on other mens sleeves and to have lost all kind of capacity of judging for themselves it is among such people and such only that the comical fellow or the agreeable devil whom i have described in a former paper acquires his prodigious reputation for wit and humor sir andrew wonderful has for some time past been esteemed a knowing one by his neighbors in the ward of farringdon without and in his business he is accounted a man of very notable dexterity but spend the evening with sir andrew at any tavern on the st jamess side of temple bar and he is all amazement from the

 three thousand pounds  good law  three thousand pounds   every man who is actuated with the laudable ambition of being a rational creature should endeavor to fix within himself such habits of thinking as will keep him collected and prevent his thoughts from being scattered into wild surprise upon every little emergence that offers there should certainly be cherished in every breast an honest pride in preserving its own free agency and maintaining an independency of understanding selfimpelled and selfdirected awakened into thinking by the impressions of its own ideas and adopting all its principles and maxims from the suggestions of its own judgment for surely there can not be any thing more unmanly than leaving either the faculties of the soul or the muscles of the face to be played upon by the will and pleasure of another to have a titter ready whenever the comical fellow chooses to be facetious and to hold a mans belief at anothers disposal according as he chooses to decide upon any subject most incontestibly indicates a weak and frivolous understanding  i was led into this tract of thought by a reflection on the manner in which i spent an evening this week with three gentlemen who had solicited the meeting with earnest importunity during the last six weeks i never met any one of them but he instantly began well my dear boy when shall we have an evening  you know it is what we have long wished for  at length the rendezvous was fixed and at the appointed hour i met my friends not without very high expectations of a pleasant evening a bottle of allens in an instant appeared on the table and circulated with uncommon celerity i then expected my friends to open some vein of discourse but all continuing in determined silence in order to break the ice i began with an ordinary topic and enquired about elizabeth canning i suppose said i the government is resolved to let her see foreign parts  that is humor said one of the gentleman to his next neighbor and then they all burst into a loud laugh i did not perceive the joke but continued i whether she is guilty or not it will do her no prejudice to see the world   humor again says the gentleman who sat opposite to me youre a fine young fellow says a second this is high says the third and then all three formed a chorus of laughter the captain who carries her abroad added i will have a good contract of it for he need give her nothing but crusts and water for six and twenty days and she will subsist upon that another touch says my friend over the way admirable cries his neighbor and the gentleman next to me alarming me with a slap on the shoulder roars out  odzouns and then laughter holding both his sides took possession of them for the space of ten minutes  upon this i perceived that my company held more of admiration than of judgment and i became heartily tired of the party though were i inclined to selfapprobation they omitted nothing that could administer to my vanity the gentleman opposite to me frequently testifying his approbation with that is humor the second repeating youre a fine young fellow and my next neighbor thundering in my ear his rapturous odzouns which extraordinary interjections were absolutely the sum total of all the conversation that i heard from these three notable blanks in the creation i accordingly took occasion to break up the meeting as soon as possible and upon retiring home to my chambers could not help drawing up this loose essay which i have ordered my publisher to send to each of the gentlemen in order if possible to cure them of their servile admiration and inform them if they desire to be ranked among freeagents that their only title to it consists in thinking and judging for themselves  true intelligence bedford

which to admire most like the traveling persian who when the reflection of the solar rays as happens sometimes in those countries have formed in a cloud another imaginary sun gazes at both with

breaks off with but see the morn in russetmantle clad walks over the dews of yon high eastern hill you know the poets are fond of personalizing both physical and moral qualities in order to give animation to their poetry and to throw things as much as possible into action and here surely we have that creative figure in its high perfection the whole picture could not receive finer colorings

other manuscripts of the same nature after perusing it i judged it would make no improper entertainment for my readers and i therefore have ordered it a place in this days paper  in the days when the empire of bagdad spread terror round the nations and their conquering arms added a constant accession of honor and wealth to the califfs aboulcasem a youth of extensive parts and boundless ambition had the address to raise himself to the first honors of the state and in process of time he arrived to the dignity of vizier in this office his conduct was such as might be expected from a person of his exalted parts his renown for genius and a bright understanding distinguished him above the rest of the ministers and the name of aboulcasem was wafted on the wings of fame through all the regions of the last  but amidst all the effulgence of his glory aboulcasem was hurried away by the violence of his passions which were rapid as the cataracts of the nile and violent as the whirlwinds in the desert his soul was apt to kindle into a blaze at the sight of beauty and in the height of his national business he would frequently sport away his hours in wanton dalliance with a circassian beauty with whom he would often betake himself to the baths and there in amorous dissipation write letters upon matters of the utmost consequence to the califf and the whole empire of bagdad and dispatch them to his agents whom he had sent to other neighboring courts at length he was suspected to favor the cause of the banished prince abdallah who was then wandering about the deserts of arabia and though no convincing proofs could be alleged against him yet not being able to vindicate himself from the imputation he was obliged to fly his country  aboulcasem immediately betook himself to the prince abdallah and finding his cause totally ruined without any possibility of reinstating him he then exerted all his industry to obtain leave to return home as things of this nature cannot be compassed in a short time in order to hinder his mind in the mean time from falling a prey to melancholy and all the horrors of disappointed ambition he applied himself to the labors of the wise men in order to relieve his mind here he penned his thoughts upon exile and many other important points of speculative morality he lived like an hermit in the deserts of arabia and there illustriously hid he carried on his researches into the study of nature history and all the branches of human learning which could adorn and enrich so accomplished a mind  thus furnished with all mental embellishments aboulcasem was in time permitted to return but he was not restored to his honors as ambition is ever unrelenting he was no sooner fixed in his own abode than he instantly became an implacable enemy to the vizier who had consented to recall him he drew from the stores of knowledge which he had formerly treasured up some of the severest reflections which could be made upon the ministers administrations and this in such a powerful strain of nervous eloquence that he may very justly be said to have had a great share in his ownfal aboulcasem was so happy as to have accomplished this business which was for a long time the grand object of his intentions but it was no sooner done than he perceived himself as distant as ever from regaining his princes ear he therefore betook himself to his country house at a small distance from bagdad where he employed himself in reading all the moralists of arabia and in short all the fine eastern writers in this recess he cultivated an acquaintance with two of the first geniuses of his time selim and mirza the former was remarkable among the eastern sages for elevated strains of poetry and the latter for those oriental tales which are generally called the tale of a tub and the adventures of gulliver the merchant of bagdad these two undertook the defense of aboulcasems character and spared no pains to blazon his fame to the world  mean time aboulcasem pursued his researches into all the branches of human wisdom the civil polity of states was to him a storehouse which disclosed a constant fund of supply he then turned his eye inwards upon the texture and make of his own mind he used to say that the mind was a concealed repository of riches and that it behoved every man to find out the secrets of it this accordingly he did but he did not enjoy the secret selfish gratification of many who when in possession of a treasure will never let it be seen by human eyes on the contrary he was glad to have every opportunity of displaying himself and this rather to a degree of ostentation from this branch of study aboulcasem proceeded to examine into matters of religion the various systems of the eastern sages were all to him perfectly well known he laughed at the keran the system of morality which confucius taught aboulcasem held in contempt mahomets paradise was to him a mere chimaera and he declaimed with a pompous flow of sounding eloquence against all these various opinions the bramins were always the objects of his severest contempt in the dictates of natural religion he would say we have no occasion for such guides and in the explanation of established forms they are highly dangerous he was an enemy to all forms of worship offered in the temple of the prophet he endeavored to subvert the principles upon which this worship was founded and to introduce a new form of thinking of his own since aboulcasem could have no share in the direction of state affairs he was determined to soar above sublunary things and to have the lead in matters of higher importance he was highly dogmatical in his assertions and he carried his extravagance so far as to advance that there was no difference between the human species and brutes and that it was highly probable that dogs and the rest of the animal creation were endued with souls as well as mankind and in the general he asserted that all souls were material  in the midst of these disquisitions aboulcasem was sitting one night in his study his lamp burning before him when of a sudden thunders rolled deep and awful over his head the mountains were shaken and they groaned keen lightenings flashed athwart the hemisphere the third heaven was opened and a flood of radiance descended upon the earth the solemnity of the scene appalled the heart of aboulcasem trembling seized his limbs he fell prostrate and adored the messenger from god who now stood before him and spoke in accents which chilled the blood within him and made him stand convinced of his vain philosophy  aboulcasem said he receive my sayings with an ear of attention know then that the eye of him who is in the third heaven has beheld thee he has viewed thy ways with compassion and he has made this vision a vehicle of instruction unto thy soul which is at present lost and bewildered in a maze of idle and foolish philosophy for thy philosophy is not calculated to advance true knowledge virtue and wisdom but has its source in ostentation ostentation and vainglory have induced thee to display thy imagined superiority of parts which pretends to pervade all systems of religion and thy hearts conceit will approve of none thy studies are ill directed and their drist is only to alienate the minds of men from any settled form of worship which you are in the wrong to disturb as your own insufficiency cannot substitute a better than what is designed to keep society in a due sense of resignation to a supreme being and to preserve the bands of civil compact religiously unbroken cast but thine eye upon yonder vale behold what is there transacted there thou may see men divested of all forms of worship and rendered perfectly conformable to thy vain notions of religion there thou may see what is the state of man ungoverned by settled forms of devotion they have shaken off all regard to the prophet and behold them immersed in all manner of vicious practices uncontrouled they invade each others rights they make war to gratify their ambition freely without restraint they proscribe whom they please the bonds of society are broken and the contempt of divine laws has introduced a contempt for all human institutions to promote this scene of confusion are thy writings calculated but know and dread the truth i am now to utter that it will better behove thee to pay submission to the established forms of worship of thy country than to disturb the peace of the faithful and thereby fill their minds with doubt with jealousy mistrust suspicion and all the horrors of an overweening imagination  at these words the radiance which spoke withdrew from his eyes and left aboulcasem in the utmost consternation the impression was however very soon effaced for notwithstanding this admonition he persevered in his ill designs but the thread of his days was cut short before he could vent them abroad into the world however his intentions were not totally frustrated for the hand of death had no sooner smote him than his compositions fell into the hands of namahran another eastern writer who sold them for a certain number of sequins of gold and by those

month of november is distinguished by foreigners as the height of the season for englishmen to hang and drown themselves but from a diligent observation i can venture to affirm that the month of may is always attended with a larger bill of mortality than any other part of the year it is the springtime of love when the blood has received a renovation of warmth and young minds are then more easily melted down in the amorous fire a bookseller whom i now and then chat with at his circulating library informs me that he can tell when the poison of love begins to rankle in the breast that he can trace it in its progress and knows exactly when it is become quite general in its influence romances he says in the beginning are more and more called for as it increases lord greys love letters the loves of octavia and philander abelard and eloise letters from a nun to a cavalier etc come into play and when the infection is grown epidemic then the tragedies of romeo and juliet all for love or

had better make them die  but if the southern gale continues they may in the conclusion be conducted by the laughing loves to the nuptial bower  the book will soon be in every bodys hands at tunbridge bath scarborough etc  thus is this skilful person in his trade for taking advantage of that succession of foibles which are constantly rising and falling in the most whimsical vicissitude in this metropolis the truth of it is the play houses the circulating libraries the public gardens about town owe very much of their success to the lovesick minds of boys and girls it is this universal passion which rolls so many of the youth of both sexes down the soft declivity in greenwichpark it is this which is so fond of taking cold at the tin cascade in vauxhall gardens and it is this which pours forth so many groupes of enamoratos along the fields and meadows about london every sunday evening  notwithstanding the extensive influence of this soft infection it is somewhat surprising that among all the writers who have endeavored to describe it very few of them have succeeded in any tolerable degree what numbers of english tragedies have been sunk into an insipid languor by the ineffectual whim of episodic love the tragedy of romeo and juliet excepting now and then some glittering conceits which we may suppose to be transfusions from the italian novellist who furnished shakespeare with the story affords a beautiful representation of two young minds touched with this tender sympathy many of the tragedies of beaumont and fletcher though they are now too much neglected display the delicate sensations of love in all their native genuine simplicity i am not clear whether the fine interchange of sentiments between jaffier and belvidera should come within the precincts of love because the desire of possession which fires the tender imagination into a gentle enthusiasm has then subsided into a sympathetic friendship between man and wife and accordingly the most pathetic touches are derived not from the lovers fond hope of mutual bliss to come but from a retrospect to those vanished hours when jaffier lay for three whole happy years in his belvideras arms and thus the transition from their former endearments to their present misery excites those intense emotions of pity for their fate perhaps after the writers just mentioned the tragedy of tancred and sigismunda has the fairest claim to any degree of reputation in this piece the love of the young prince is manly and never dwindles into childish conceit the feelings of sigismunda are delicate and sensible and through all the scenes the softness of their passion is ennobled by sentiments of honor and moral dignity but among all the books which the enamoured of both sexes are apt to call for at this season of the year there is none which can exhibit so lively a picture of love as the fourth book of drydens virgil which i would recommend to my young readers not by way of adding fuel to the fire but to warn them of the dangers of the growing flame as they will here perceive all the vicissitudes of the passion till at length it terminates in a melancholy catastrophe  i shall conclude this paper with an extract from an unpublished pamphlet written by an ingenious gentleman who has given me leave to make my own use of it it is called the history of rosamonds pond for the month of may and

party for the moderns was led on by monsieur de la motte perrault and wotton the two former were vigorously opposed by boileau madam dacier and the latter by mr pope and doctor swift swift ordered a new edition of his battle of the books to be published forthwith and pope took occasion to reprint his essays and criticisms upon homer the old and new interest were the words by which each party signified their attachments and reams of lampoons acrostics and rebusses were issued out by the moderns which were all answered by epigrams fables and burlesque pieces written by the friends of the ancients  at length the writs were issued out to the proper officers to choose representatives for the several counties and boroughtowns in parnassus some places by poetic license having leave to return as many members as could fairly prove a qualification homer and virgil were declared for epic poetry milton was set up by the encouragement of several friends and they were all three accordingly chosen homer had four and twenty upon the poll and virgil twelve milton by an assessment a little before the election created two new votes by which he also reached the number twelve and virgil was so modest that he made no objection to it tasso and sir richard blackmore were declared candidates but the former was proved to have bribed with clinquant and the latter could not make out a qualification  in the regions of tragedy sophocles and euripides joined interests and aristotle undertook to canvass for them but shakespeare carried it by a great majority corneille and racine stood next upon the list but a scrutiny was demanded in favor of the old interest upon a suspicion that several copyholders had polled for the moderns and the newinterest employed some french critics to go through their answer it was thought it will at last end in a double return and it was further said that otway and row would be declared duly elected dryden and lee joined interests and though many gay and flighty persons were very warm in their cause their schemes were looked upon by the cool and judicious as rather too wild and romantic the french critics threatened that at some future election they should be able to make more members being resolved to put up crebillon and voltaire even against shakespeare to which end several libels against the last mentioned genius were already drawn up by voltaire  in the comic territories the ancients lost their election by a very great majority moliere ben johnson congreve and vanburgh being declared duly elected shakespeare was made an honourary member for this quarter and was universally allowed to be a representative of both places dryden found means by the assistance of a spanish friar to insinuate himself into this place and it was given out that when colley cibber arrives here he will be put up as a person duly qualified though it is apprehended that his quarrel with pope has deprived him of several votes  the new interest exulted greatly upon their conquest in the last election and in order to complete their triumph proceed further into the regions of humor and ridicule homer was here again put up by aristotle who urged the margites as a sufficient claim but the writings of that estate being lost he was obliged to decline the poll after this an advertisement was published desiring the votes and interest of all the true sons of merriment for aristophanes menander plautus and terence who had just lost their election in another place lucian set up upon his own interest the moderns declared cervantes rablais swift and butler joint candidates being all gentlemen heartily attached to true wit and humor votes were also solicited for several other personages monsieur la sage scarroon marivaux and addison were strongly recommended but the latter being returned in conjunction with terence and la sage for the borough of politemirth sir richard steel appeared on the hustings and withdrew his friends name swift mixed with the lower sort of people joked with the women about their dressingrooms and republished his account of the strange man just arrived in town rablais contributed a good deal to the general mirth cervantes occasionally gave vent to a vein of low humor but lucian could not make himself universally understood and many of his turns did not allude to modernpractised life scarroon got together a company of strollers and exhibited entertainments in booths with great success ward concanon and tom brown offered themselves on this occasion but were rejected with contempt at length the books were closed and lucian cervantes butler and swift were declared duly elected at which the managers for the new interest were highly instamed they lodged a petition in favor of rablais but such a vein of extravagance run through the whole and some passages were worked up into such a strain of unintelligible frolic that it was generally supposed it would be given against him however his friends were determined to bring him in for an inferior borough and scarron and marivaux were also assured of their election whenever fielding shall arrive to his estate in this part of parnassus there is a borough ready to elect him  to have so many moderns chosen for the last division was highly agreeable to the new interest they were however a good deal dejected at the election for history for which the contest was ineffectual thycidides sallust livy and tacitus being chosen by a great majority faminianus strada endeavored to hurt the election of the last mentioned writer in order as it was thought to substitute himself but peers being allowed to appear at elections in parnassus lord bolingbroke gave all his interest to tacitus and assured him that his works were of infinite use in all his political tracts sallust recommended st real an approved french historian to a borough julius caesar was put up without his consent a literary fame not being the object of his ambition lord clarendon was for a long time decried by a party but was at last declared duly elected  demosthenes and cicero harangued from the hustings and were unanimously chosen for oratory and it was thought that some who have made a conspicuous figure in the british parliaments would be admitted to the honor of a seat with those immortal geniusses a party of frenchmen endeavored to make a stand upon the strength of some certain funeral orations but in a few hours they found themselves greatly outpolled  horace boileau dryden and mr pope were made the representatives of satyr juvenal and perseus having set up for places upon their own separate interests as soon as the election was over mr pope thanked the constituents for the honor conferred upon him and signified his inclination to take his seat for ethics to which he was reeommended by the lord viscount bolingbroke and the voters came to a resolution to fill up the vacancy by putting up the famous doctor young though in his absence  lord bacon and mr lock were returned for real and useful philosophy at which aristotle was violently curaged he was however somewhat comforted to find himself the first on the poll for criticism longinus quintilian and bobours were also declared duly elected there was a great number of boroughs in this county most of which were repsesented by frenchmen the chief of whom was the abbe du bos author of the reflections upon poesy and painting mr addison was also returned in this district but being previously chosen he thanked the voters in general and told them they would not be at a loss for a proper representative for that place whenever the author of the polymetis should be willing to stand the poll  in the regions of miscellaneous poetry dryden had an offer from almost every place spencer was elected for a borough said to be overrun with witches and fairies in pastoral ambrose phillips exerted his utmost interest but it was said that mr pope though he did not choose to be the

amori virg my friend mr candid desires that he may discharge his promise to give some further animadversions on the tragedy of king lear as he has run into a long essay i shall resign to him the entire paper of this day  notwithstanding what is ingeniously urged by the gentleman who obliged me with a letter upon my former criticism of king lear i cannot after a review of that tragedy find any reason to retract my assertion that the aged monarchs madness is occasioned by the ingratitude of his daughters the folly of a parents putting himself in the power of his children must incidentally appear in a play founded on such a story as that of lear but had those children not proved ungrateful i apprehend there is no reason to imagine the kings mind would have taken the fatal turn it did but the best way of knowing with any degree of certainty the secret causes of those effects which disclose themselves in sundry appearances in human life is by gaining an insight into the private tempers of men lean considered in this manner soon discovers to us the latent seeds which are likely to kindle into a blaze upon the revolt of his daughters the impression which cordelias artless answer had upon him is described by himself  o most small fault how ugly did thou in cordelia show which like an engine wrenchd my frame of nature from these a place drew from my heart all love and added to the gail  this plainly evinces where the old mans passions were most accessible and how strong the workings of them were likely to be when he should find a total disaffection no wonder if then his frame of nature is wrenchd from the fixed place and indeed his tendency that way soon discovers itself when he breaks out into these words  i will forget my nature  so kind a father  were the loss of royalty uppermest in his thoughts his remarks would most assuredly take their tincture from thence and he would rather blame himself as a weak father who had given all to his children but the circumstance of his having given all is never mentioned unless it is to aggravate the illusage he has met with and when he says to himself to take it again perforce it is plain that it is not merely for the sake of regaining lost grandeur but to avenge his wrongs and he immediately subjoins monster ingratitude  and a little after let me not be mad not mad sweet heaven  the hool indeed taunts him with the folly of his having divested himself of his power and put the rod as he calls it in his childrens hand these ideas are so obvious that shakespeare knew they would strike even the most superficial mind but we find it is no consideration with the father who never dwells upon it though it is suggested to him so frequently on the other hand how acute are his feelings whenever he recurs to his daughters want of filial piety he that can read the following lines without being softened into tears must as mr addison has said upon another occasion have either a very good or a very bad head   oh regan she has tied sharptoothd unkindness like a vulture here   i scarce can speak to thee  thou wilt not believe with how depraved a quality  oh regan  what a picture of a mind have we here  the strugglings with his sorrows the breaks of passion the attempt to speak and the instant suppression of his powers are the most natural and pathetic touches can the human imagination in all her treasury of language find words to express at once the detestable crime of disobedience to our parents and the exquisite feelings of an injured father like the following passage   she has struck me with her tongue most serpent like upon the very heart who is there that does not instantaneously find himself in a gush of tears on reading these lines and more particularly when a little afterward he comes to the speech which closes with  you think i will weep  no i will not weep  though i have full cause of weeping   this heart shall break into a thousand flaws or ever i will weep  o fool i shall go mad  the last touch in this speech is the finest close of a climax of passion that can be conceived and even then the old monarch feels that his wits begin to turn for which melancholy situation shakespeare all along finely prepares us by skilfully marking each step the mind takes in all its workings toward that settled state of grief  i have dwelld thus long on the cause of lears distraction because the arguments offered by my ingenious correspondent in the essay of the   th of january carry some degree of plausibility but from what has been premised together with what i have urged in my former paper there cannot i think remain any doubt about it those that are not satisfied with this reasoning are referred to the noblest commentary this or any poet ever had i mean mr garricks performance of lear in which there is displayed so just a knowledge of the human mind under a state of madness together with such exquisite feelings of the various shiftings of the passions so finely at the same time enseebled with the debility of age that i believe whenever this admirable actor ceases to play this part the unhappy monarch will lose more than fifty of his followers at a clap   though our great poet pays us very amply for all his transgressions against the laws of aristotle yet i have frequently wished that the noble wildness of his genius had not rendered him so unbounded in his fables had this tragedy been planned with more art without an underplot to draw off our affections from the principal object it had been a piece for all the united efforts of greece to envy however the episode in which the bastard is acting the same unnatural part as lears legitimate daughters is not entirely detached from the main subject the misfortunes of the good old gloucester who endeavors to assist the forlorn king must touch every breast and the character of edgar must appear amiable in every eye  the close of this tragedy is full of terror and commiseration and our great foet has here given us a death which is not often to be found in the playhouse bill of mortality viz the death of lear without the dagger or the bowl but perhaps after all the heartpiercing sensations which we have before endured through the whole piece it would be too much to see this actually performed on the stage from the actor whom i have already named i am sure it would though i should be glad to see the experiment made convinced at the same time that the play as it is altered will always be most agreeable to an audience as the circumstances of lears restoration and the virtuous edgars alliance with the amiable cordelia must always call forth those gushing tears which are swelled and enobled by a virtuous joy the alteration is justified by another reason which is that lear was really restored to his crown if we may believe spencer who gives the following remarkable narrative with which i shall close this paper making no doubt but it will afford great entertainment to the reader who has not before amused himself with the comparison to see shakespeares story related by so great a poet as spencer in his tenth canto of the fairyqueen     next him king lear in happy peace long reigned but had no issue male him to succeed but three fair daughters which were well uptraind in all that seemed fit for kingly seed among whom his realm he equally decreed to have divided though when feeble age nigh to his utmost date he saw proceed he called his daughters and with speeches sage inquired which of them most did love her parentage    the eldest gonoril gan to protest that she much more than her own life him loved and regan greater love to him professed than all the world whenever it were proved but cordeil said she loved him as behooved whose simple answer wanting colors fair to paint it forth him to displeasance moved that in his grown he counted her no heir but twixt the other twain his kingdom whole did share    so wedded one to maglan king of scots and the other to the king of cambria and twixt them shared his realm by equal lots but without dower the wise cordelia was sent to aganip of celtica their aged sure thus eased of his crown a private life led

instance to be in a very ridiculous situation and surely the author who can quit the pursuit of nobler game to follow an idle scribler in the form of a pamphlet a letter to a friend an unmuselike poem or a pointless epigram must in the eyes of the judicious appear to act unworthily and very much beneath himself on this account it is that ranger has hitherto kept himself clear of all disputes with his brethren of the quill and has incessantly pursued his plan though there have not been wanting things that would be poets thought who have endeavored to molest him in his career  but deaf to all such avocations i have attended only to the prosecution of the design this paper first set out with viz to conduce my utmost to the entertainment and instruction of my readers the former of these views i flatter myself has in some degree succeeded and with regard to the latter i do not pretend to have enlightened the understandings of all my cotemporaries nor to have brought about a general reformation of men and manners the truth of it is i cannot consider the grays inn journal as a general panacea for the defects of mankind though my bookseller and many of my other friends i e enemies have been pleased to compliment me on that score when i declare thus much i beg i may not be supposed to envy the fame of a very elegant and ingenious brotherwriter who very pleasantly congratulates

charles ranger esquire sir for twenty years last past i have been afflicted with a most extraordinary species of pride which affected my head to so great a degree that i could never during that time bow it to any one who was not possessed of a fortune of ten thousand pounds which reduced me to such a situation that all my acquaintance shunned my company but upon perusal of your paper of the   th of november i immediately found such a relaxation in the sinews of my neck that i can already make a slight bow to my equals and there is such an amendment in my organs of speech that i can pronounce sir or madam to any decent person of either sex the truth of the above i am willing to attest on oath when called upon and am  sir your most obedient servant george stiffneck   this is the only

languages of all nations have ever been in a state of fluctuation and we find this complaint is constantly made by the sensible and judicious in every age though the diction of the romans is likely to endure as long as time shall subsist yet we find that horace in the words of my motto is aware of the decay of words and phrases which die away and are constantly succeeded by a sudden birth of new terms and modes of phraseology in several other passages of his writings there are short reflections upon this literary phenomenon in which he always delivers himself with sorrow and regret they fall says he like leaves and are replaced by a new product like young persons they flourish for a short time and then tend to oblivion the comparison is most certainly very just and as young men in their bloom and vigor are said to be upon town it is the same with words they are also upon town for a time and then totally perish i have often thought that a weekly bill of words would not be unentertaining to men of letters and if there was a proper register office for the purpose where their several births and burials might be recorded with accuracy and precision i should imagine it would furnish no disagreeable history a distinction might be made between a kind of sex in words according as they are appropriated to men or women as for instance d  n my blood is of male extraction and pshaw fiddlestick i take to be female upon this plan the weekly bill might stand in this form  born this week males  00 females  00   00 buried males  00 females  00    0   decreased in the burial

phrase whether it be born of honest parents in england or ireland what company it kept whether it was whig or tory popish or protestant it would in my opinion be an agreeable addition to this verbal history there might further be added an account of such expressions as might happen to be naturalized with the objections of the learned who should think proper to protest against such a naturalization of foreigners among the natives of this land such a procedure could not fail to yield satisfaction to the curious and though it would not prevent the instability of our language it would at least display the gradual steps toward improvement or final destruction for my part i have ever looked upon the permanency of our language to be of greater consequence than the stocks of whatever denomination and for that reason i should be glad that some mcans were devised to hinder the diction of our shakespeare and milton from being obliterated and to suspend the evils which mr pope threatens us with when he says and such as chaucer is shall dryden be  the dictionary which the erudition of mr johnson is preparing for the public may in some measure answer this end and in aid to that design i have been for some time past planning a dictionary of such words as appeared to me from a concurrence of various causes to be most likely to be totally forgot in order to forward this undertaking i have annexed a specimen of the work not as yet reduced into alphabetical order but drawn out in such a manner as may serve to convey some idea of the intended work when the whole is completed it may serve as a proper companion to the spectator the tatler and all the works of morality which have been published in this country and it may be contributing to make our posterity have some faint notion of what is meant in many places when the visible tendency of our manners to an entire change from ancient simplicity has almost effaced the ideas which the author of the times intended to express  a specimen of an english dictionary creature a term to show our contempt of any person whom we dislike chiefly used by the ladies  thing very often used to imply our dislike but chiefly used to signify our highest approbation thus it is said of a fine lady she is the very thing or of a young fellow o maem he is the very thing and sometimes with limitation as yes very well but not the thing  patriot a man who speaks against the court till he gets a place or pension  honest this term is derived from the latin word honestum which among the romans implied every thing that is honorable in a character from thence pope was induced to say an honest mans the noblest work of god this is the original meaning of the word in its consequential sense it is strangely altered honest now signifies gaming drinking and debauchery of every sort it being common to say of a man who is addicted to all these fashionable vices that he is an honest fellow  goodnature an old english word used by our ancestors it is plain that it carried with it some allusion to the customs and manners of those times but there is no tracing it to its source  religion an old english word for the worship of a supreme being and the practice of social duties to our neighbors probably a custom known to the ancient druids  humbug a lie  worth originally it meant laudable qualities of the mind at present it is solely confined to a mans fortune thus a scoundrel of fifty thousand is a man of worth and an honest man in indigence is worth nothing  party sormerly signified divisions in the state at present it means a jaunt to vauxhall bedlam church or any place of diversion  tragedy a name by which shakespeare otway and some others entitled their dramatic writings the moderns retain the word but have totally lost the original sense of it  comedy probably a piece in which our rude ancestors represented the follies and characters of the age nothing of this sort is at present known amongst us  damned when priestcraft prevailed in this country the people were frightened with strange ideas of hell or a place of torture where the departed spirits of bad men were supposed to be confined at present it signifies the highest praise we can confer thus we say a damned fine woman a damned charming creature a damned fine fellow etc  drum an instrument of warlike music used at the march of an army or in time of battle to animate the soldiery hence styled by shakespeare the spirit stirring drum it has not been used to any purpose by the english since the days of the duke of marlborough in its metaphorical sense it means a party of cards vide rout  friendship an old english word used by our ancestors to signify the complex idea of affection and esteem between two or more persons founded upon a virtuous sympathy of tempers and congenial habits of virtue  for the meaning of the word virtue see in its respective place this custom was totally banished in the reign of king charles ii and few or no traces of it have been discovered ever since  god the ancient druids it is probable from all historians imagined that a superior being superintended the direction of the universe and the term god it is not unlikely originally fignified this superior being but since it has been happily found out that every thing was made by chance or that nature vide nature in its proper place produced every thing we behold and since the properties of matter have been sufficiently detected by lord bolingbroke and others the term god is totally exploded as merely expressive of some chimaera which has no existence  modesty alludes to some custom among the ancient british ladies  earthquake a party at cards vide rout drum or hurricane  fashion a polite term of excuse for all the vices that can be thought of  nature nothing at all it is often called plastic nature universal nature etc but the idea is always the same  rout formerly signified the defeat of an army and when the soldiers were all put to flight or to the sword they were said to be routed the ladies in order to preserve some idea of cressi poitiers blenheim etc have agreed to call their assemblies by the name of routs this it is thought they do with more propriety as frequently at these meetings whole families are entirely routed out of house and home  soui it was formerly believed that in each human creature there existed something incorruptible which was not to perish with the dissolution of our bodies but to be removed to some other part of the universe and there to enjoy the reward due to virtue or suffer condign punishment for all transgressions while in this state of probation but the happy discovery of the properties of matter has also banished this absurd doctrine which serves now to embellish the fictions of poets  immense an epithet of praise thus we say an immense fine woman etc vide damned  virtue the ancient druids made it a rule to keep all their passions in due government by which mean they were

ingredior sanctos ausus recludere fontes virg our club met a few nights since at the devil tavern when the conversation principally turned upon topics of literature and particularly dramatic poetry many of our best modern tragedies were examined and i observed it was frequently said of pieces confessedly inartificial in the fable unforcible in sentiment and destitute of character that they contained a very fine vein of poetry our professor of criticism immediately objected to the propriety of the expression he did not understand how a bad play could have fine poetry and he has formed a plan for a set of papers which may throw some light on this matter i shall this day present my readers with one which i think may serve as an opening to the design  in order to decide upon the excellence or imperfection of any art it is necessary to know the original intent and aim of that art and also the several means by which it accomplishes its designs the better to investigate this with regard to any branch of literature it will be expedient to trace all manner of composition to its source and thence to pursue the several rivulets which have streamed from it this has been done with great perspicuity and elegance by the author of the essays on the characteristics who has very justly determined the three primary branches of composition to be poetry eloquence and argument he adds that a just coalition of the three forms the consummate beauty of fine writing and then continues he it would be perhaps both a new and pleasing speculation to point out the writers in their several kinds who have been most remarkably excellent or defective with regard to the just union of these three species of cemposition at present it must suffice to have hinted such a criticism which the reader may easily prosecute such a criticism might distinguish the respective graces of all kinds of writing and furnish the criterions by which to judge of the proper beauties of each different species i shall now beg leave to offer a few cursory reflections on this subject and in order to proceed with the greater perspicuity shall attempt a short account of the rise of the three modes of writing already mentioned  man being a sociable creature it was necessary that certain signs universally agreed upon should be used for the reciprocal conveyance of his ideas sounds which we call words were the quickest vehicles and therefore grew into general use according as our stock of ideas eniarged itself the demand for words became more extensive and as societies were framed and people assembled by civil policy intercourse begot further acquisitions and thus language was daily enlarged but it being impossible that every distinct idea should be expressed by a term appropriated to it the mind naturally had recourse to the faculty of reason which compares distinguishes and separates the ideas which have passed through the senses or have been formed into different combinations by the power of imagination by these means a similitude was discovered between sundry various images and thence it followed that things were expressed by borrowed names on account of a resemblance existing between them the term thus transferred was called a metaphor and as it happens in the commercial intercourse of mankind what was at firist introduced out of necessity became in process of time an absolute luxury this the poets soon perceived and as it was their business to lead uncultivated multitudes from their huts and dens by seizing their imaginations with their songs and ballads the metaphor soon appeared to them to be an effectual means of painting things in warmer colors to the fancy which is ever greatly delighted when any new and unforeseen assemblage is offered to its view the epithet which denotes the qualities inherent in all objects lent its auxiliary aid and poetry with these adventitious ornaments became the delight of mankind  but the matter did not rest here as cities were multiplied and as states enlarged themselves artificial passions began to operate ambition then began to grasp at power and preeminence and envy jealousy revenge and malice sowed the seeds of discord and mutual distrust and thus while they were distracted with intestine commotions the adjacent states desirous of extending their possessions made inroads upon them in these emergencies there was not time for the measured writer to produce his poetic composition an immediate address was requisite to influence the passions of the multitude and therefore men of genius came forth and destitute of number addressed the people in humble prose but here still the attention was to be fixed and therefore they could not divest themselves of all the properties of poetry but continued to address themselves to the imagination of their auditors and thus to influence their passions and persuade them to their own good as the least appearance of a design upon their understandings on these occasions would totally defeat itself it thence resulted that all those ambitious ornaments and all those gaudy colorings which poetry spreads so lavishly on every subject were here introduced with a more sparing hand and the imagination was only addressed as it affords various accesses to the passions in this manner eloquence deduced its being and was only a less luxuriant kind of poetry which endeavored to practice the arts of persuasion and to win over the passions of the people to its own end and use  in proportion as mankind became enlightened as arts and manufactures increased and as science extended itself it was not enough that poetry charmed with its graceful combinations and that eloquence awakened and agitated the passions reason began then to exert its influence to look for utility and truth in every composition and stripping away the luxuriances of lavish description it began cooly and dispassionately to consider every thing that was offered hence sprung the didactic or the argumentative demosthenes was obliged to proceed by fair deductions and as much as possible to conceal his art from a people who were so polished that they would have despised those arts of persuasion which tully practiced with success upon minds less artful and less informed than the greeks  in this manner it appears to me these three primary branches of composition arose in the world each being plainly deducible from the very principles of our constitution for as the imagination is the warmest faculty of the soul poetry whose principal intent is to please is particularly addressed to this power of perception eloquence though more chaste and reserved in its embellishments strikes chiefly at the passions and as they are then most powerfully excited when fancy pictures strong appearances of good or evil eloquence is obliged to have recourse to the regions of imagination in order to render its colorings stronger and more glowing and further as the province of reason is to compare its ideas and to form various affirmations or negations relative to them the didactic is principally confined to this province there are not in human nature any other inlets of perception or any other faculties of sensation to which the art of a writer could apply and therefore the imagination the passions and reason are justly the three springs of composition but men of refinement and reflection perceiving what a powerful influence any one of these branches of writing has upon the mind have thence inferred that the joint force of all three united must carry the power of genius to still a greater degree of perfection and therefore in whatever way they were engaged they have made it their business to make excursions into their neighbors territories and borrow thence several improvements to heighten their productions as for instance in like manner as eloquence has learned from poetry to warm and enliven the imagination poetry has marked the influence of eloquence on the passions and has endeavored to glide to the heart through the same inlets and both have also found it necessary to recommend themselves to reason and have occasionally strengthened themselves with insertions of the didactic the reasoning faculty has in its turn perceived that a mere train of deductions would be too dry and therefore it takes occasion to adorn itself with the flowers of imagination and in some speculations it even endeavors to awaken the passions  hence then it appears that a concurrence of the primary branches of writing is requisite in all works of genius but as there is some danger of running riot and making too frequent and unjustifiable progresses into each others territories it was necessary to fix the boundaries of each kind and to determine how far any one of them may indulge itself in its approaches toward the others in order to preserve the essential difference in every composition to observe the proper qualities and the just colorings of each or as horace has it dnctas servare vices operumque colores  there are in nature but few original colors and it is from the meltings and softenings of these into each other that all other appearances to the eye derive their origin it is the fame in writing the several species of it which are now practiced are modes of poetry eloquence and argument differently blended how far the union is just shall be occasionally examined in a few detached essays and by these means we shall see the peculiar merit of an epic poem a tragedy a comedy etc and the reader may at his

accession she dissolved her parliament turned out of her privy council every person of sense and discretion and introduced in their room a french haircutter two milliners a chambermaid and many other personages of equal rank and condition by the advice of these assistants she reigned with despotic sway she heard the complaints of her slaves without ever feeling the least propensity to a redress of their grievances which occasioned violent heartburnings and at length called forth a shoal of writers against her government as generally happens in all political states when the supreme power is abused a number of sonnetteers libellers and epigrammatists who daily poured forth treason against her beauty and pronounced her born to enslave mankind she had a very particular pleasure in signing metaphorical death warrants for her votaries and she looked upon the whole race of mankind formed to flatter her vanity and to pay her adoration she exacted tributes of admiration at such an exorbitant rate that at last an hambden arose who disputed with her a contribution of incences which she insisted upon this proceeding opened the eyes of the rest of her subjects who all conspired to dethrone her in the twentythird year of her age and then fell the tyrant maria without one to lament her fall after a short reign of five years in which she conquered with so wild a rage as the poet has it that with the universal joy succeeded to her the fair elizabeth whose reign commenced like a mild evening after the violent scorching of a hot summers day  elizabeth endeavored to render

the three principal qualities of poetry its aim says he is to afford at once utility and delight to offer what may be agreeable to the fancy and also what may conduce to the advantages of human life he further adds it is not enough for a poem to abound in prettynesses it must also have a sweet access to the heart and should be able to agitate the soul with what passions it pleases this description involves all the leading requisites of poetry and it is remarkable includes the three primary branches of composition exhibited in a former paper viz the art of addressing our reason in order to be useful the imagination to be agreeable and the passions in order to persuade and gain upon our affections here then we have poesy eloquence and argument united and most assuredly that performance will be found the most excellent in its kind which is the most highly finished with regard to these three essentials  epic poetry has always had the preeminence and i suppose the reason of this determination is because it affords the freest and most ample room for a display of the three primary and original species of writing it is by observing how these friendly colors mix and blend with each other that we are to deduce a judgment upon the different authors who have proved any way eminent in the literary world refering to the first principles being the only criterion in every art bossu and other critics have informed us that the epic fable must involve one entire action that this action must have a beginning a middle and an end they have told us that the poet must not take up the thread of his narrative too near the clue but that he must hasten into the midst of things and occasionally give a retrospect to such things as are necessary to be known they have treated largely of the machinery of the time the fable should include with many other particulars which though proper to be explained do not any way conduce to the refinement of taste or the improvement of true genius it is most certain by observing from what principles in the human frame each art is deducible that any real or valuable criticism can be formed  it is manifest then that the epic writer has free latitude of inserting all the graces of every kind of composition all nature lies at his command wherever he casts his eyes he is lord of the manor he can turn a road by poetical act of parliament through lawns and groves and scenes of pasturage the four seasons obey his directions and he need never be at a loss for agreeable exhibitions of nature to please the imagination the whole system of ethics is also his he may frequently take occasion to improve his readers by short sentences and transient reflections on human life and by these means he may gain upon our reason to approve his performances the whole art of eloquence is likewise perfectly open to the epic author and from thence he may derive an irresistible power over our passions in this last mentioned requisite the abbe du bos places the consummate persection of fine poetry certain it is the mind of man never feels such intense pleasure from any of the imitative arts as when its passions are awakened and it finds itself roused from an impassive state and unexpectedly agitated by the skilful touches of a masterpoet the author just quoted ascribes this ideal appearance to the satisfaction which the soul enjoys at the perception of its own activity may we not add to this what is suggested if i remember right by the author of the pleasure of the imaginations our moral sense receives on the occasion an additional delight to see that the social affections are in harmony and proportion and feelingly awake to the due sensations of humanity and this in conjunction with the gratifications which we are apt to take in comparing the ideas which reality has suggested with those excited by the art of imitation conspire to render a warm and wellexecuted passage in poetry so agreeable to all mankind in general  were i to declare in which of the three powers of the mind already mentioned i think homer virgil and milton to be most eminently shining i should ascribe to homer the strongest and most vigorous efforts of imagination and an amazing faculty of alarming us with noble and amazing descriptions of all the magnificent objects in nature as to our own milton i should be inclined to declare him a rival of the greek poet for a comprehensive sublimity of conception and virgils excellence i should place in beautiful touches of poetic eloquence his whole fourth book i take to be a masterpiece in this way the various agitations of mind which dido endures her love her jealousy her rage her tenderness her many mixed emotions are perhaps the finest strokes in poetry in his sixth book also there are several scenes of the most tender nature and in the ninth book the grief of the mother after the death of nisus and euryalus and the lamentations of evander are all to be ranked in the same class and in my opinion afford a pleasure not to be met with in either of the other poets even though homer has succeeded so well in hectors last scene with andromache and though our great milton has a great deal of finely impassionated dialogue in his justly celebrated poem virgil more frequently applies himself to the passions of his readers than the other two and notwithstaneing some pretty strong improbabilities he does not so frequently shock our reason as the grecian poet who certainly in some particulars is extravagant to the highest degree milton has the advantage of having founded his story upon traditions which our religion has sanctified otherwise i should consider his fallen angels and the war waged by them together with the invention of cannon and many other circumstances highly chimerical even though they expand our fancy with grand and surprising appearances  i shall take another opportunity to consider how far tragedy may dispute with the epic for the preference and shall only add at present that i have ever been of opinion that all the writers of heroic poesy have in general been too fond of the mavelous by this i would not be understood to censure the use of machinery which when introduced with sobriety and discretion serves to present agreeable scenery to the mind and i could wish that the correctness of mr glovers judgment had not entirely excluded it from his poem of leonidas which certainly has many passages of warm poetic eloquence many pieces of beautiful imagery and several strictures of useful and improving morality artfully interwoven with the groundwork of his fable  i shall beg leave to conclude with an observation which is not entirely foreign to the purpose it is remarked by mr addison that virgil has but one conceit throughout his poem and that says he is put into the mouth of the young julus when with a kind of punning ambiguity he observes that they are eating their tables but surely the great critic had forgot the passage where the poet tells us that aeneas in runuing round a tree after the flying turnus follows the man who follows him  sequiturque sequentem  this tried by the rule of bohours appears to have truth for its foundation but it is so childish a truth that i am sorry to find it intermixed with the majesty of the aeneid but perhaps it is like the fly on the picture which

he drove the loaded camel over mount pharan for a jeweller of cairo and having at length by an amazing parsimony got together a few sequins of gold he followed the occupation of his master affairs thrived so well with him that in the course of a few years mirgehan began to assume to himself the pride of wealth and his countenance which formerly was humbled by poverty and a dejection of spirits began to brighten into gleams of selfsatisfaction in order to extend his interest and enlarge his schemes for the accumulation of wealth mirgehan now basking under the sunshine of his fortune resolved to remove to bafra where he was soon distinguished as the most eminent merchant of the place as it is the nature of ambition to be ever restless and unsatisfied after having in the course of six years residence amassed a very ample fortune he determined with himself to change his abode once more and settle himself with all his immense wealth at bagdad  mingehan was no sooner fixed at bagdad than the reputation of his affluence spread itself abroad in all convivial meetings among the rest of the merchants as soon as his lips seemed to open every tongue was suspended with silence every eye gazed at him with admiration and every ear devoured the periods of his story with greedy earnestness his voice which naturally was as rough as the sound occasioned by a collision of billows on the ocean now seemed as fost as the fragrant gale which pants upon the leaves of the arabian trees  by this time mirgehans credit was become so extensive that people of all ranks and conditions deposited their money with him and he had every day a very great number of servants counting over the sequins of gold which he was either to receive or pay away for others in the midst of all these smiles of fortune it happened that the relict of a rich merchant lately snatched away from the face of the earth by the angel of death attracted his attention her name was dardane born in the city of damas and now in the possession of very great wealth from the habits which education and time had implanted in her she was in her temper of a most greedy avarice and a powerful ambition to be counted richer than the rest of her acquaintance urged by these instigations she bestowed her lovely form upon mirgehan who in a short time so contrived it that the roses faded on her cheek the lilly appeared of a yellower hue and by flow degrees her constitution received such severe strokes from his severity that she totally pined away and in a short time lay breathless on her bed  mirgehan was now happy in the completion of his wishes he had got rid of a wife whom notwithstanding her exquisite beauty his soul ever abhorred and he exulted in the review of the vast accession to his fortune which through her means he had obtained his heatt now began to expand with greater alacrity and he resolved to spend the remainder of his days in ease in elegance in luxury and every delicate enjoyment the dainties of the east did not suffice to crown his board he would send to the west for turtle and every corner of the globe administered to his gratifications not far from bagdad he purchased a most elegant and magnificent house where he determined to fix his country retreat the rooms eternally resounded with singers and minstrels amber and aloes contributed their rich perfumes and his tables were covered with vases of agate filled with the most delicious liquors painting and sculpture concurred to adorn his apartments mirgehan was led into all this profusion by an irresistible vanity from which he derived many exquisite sensations of pleasure when he found his wealth and his possessions admired he the more readily suffered himself to be governed by this turn of mind from a conviction that all his grand appearance of affluence served to extend his reputation and that in consequence of his extensive credit he should have ample and frequent opportunities of reimbursing himself by the use he knew to make of the pecuniary confidence which others reposed in him  mirgehan was now happy in all the enjoyments which riches could procure him his heart danced to perpetual tunes of joy and the meanness of his birth he thought sufficiently compensated by the luster and dignity of his present way of life and now to complete his elevation and to raise himself to that point of eminence from which he imagined he might look down upon most of his fellow creatures fortune who had for a series of years smiled propitiously upon all the undertakings of mirgehan at length presented an opportunity  it happened that the emperor of bagdad had occasion on a particular emergence in his affairs to call together an assembly of the wisest and ablest heads in his territories in order to assist his councils to help him in framing salutary laws for the due regulation of his subjects and to point out proper measures for him to levy the moneys necessary toward defraying the expenses of his soldiers and other contingences in government the califf resolved upon this step with the advice of his vizir and in a few days mandates were dispatched to sundry different parts commanding the provinces and towns to depute to the general divan two persons the most renowned for sagacity and judgment mirgehan was at his countryseat when he heard this news and his passions being violent as the eddying sand during a tempest he instantly conceived a desire to be enrolled among the most distinguished politicians of bagdad  accordingly he forthwith set out upon this expedition but he had not gone far from his own habitation when traveling a solitary road over a long extended mountain the heat of the day together with the fatigue he had undergone inclined him to stop under a shady retreat and refresh his senses with a gentle slumber from this he was soon awakened by a strain of music which thrilled so melodiously in his ears that he thought gleams of paradise were opening to his dazzled sight he looked around and saw a reverend form advance toward him mirgehan arose from the arbor in which he was reclined and instantly throwing himself on his knees he worshipped the venerable appearance which stood before him this personage was an holy hermit who long inhabited a small mansion on the side of a rock which terminated the prospect on the left side of the mountain being endowed with a magic power he called forth to his sight such beautiful scenes as looked like a new creation mirgehans heart throbbed with holy rapture at length the hoary sage began mirgehan i know thy purpose i am acquainted with thy design in this thy journey but reflect o man on the obscurity of thy birth and the meanness of thy education can thou confer light to the councils of the wise can thou dispel the mist from before their eyes and let in powerful irradiations of truth upon their darkling understandings desist vain man from thy illfounded pursuits at these words the venerable hermit waved his wand and suddenly the scene vanished like a morningdream from mirgehans eyes after having again raised his arm now says he let the objects that are placed before thee instruct thy soul there behold how easily thou might have squandered away all those possessions which thy soul delights in for a mere empty bubble there see an election for two persons to assist in the debates for the ease and happiness of the califf and his people see the blind the lame the old the infirm the sick arriving in caravans to vote for those who pay them highest see how they all solemnly vow by the holy prophet that money has no influence upon them and yet behold how in private they grasp the sequins of gold does not thy heart which has fixed all its affections upon thy yellow dirt tremble within thee to think that in this manner all thy wealth might be squandered away and thou not be able to render the least service to the califf thy country or thy family that this is the fate of many who like thee have arose from mean beginnings and have in their old days proved mere spendthrifts thou may receive ocular demonstration by surveying those wretches who are now despised by their

funem mihi posse videtur ire poeta meum qui pectus inaniter angit irritat mulcet falsi terroribus implet ut magus and modo me the bis modo ponit athenis hor there is not a species of writing which has not had its particular admirer and various affirmations have been made concerning the excellence of each the famous doctor south was of opinion that a complete epigram is the masterpiece of composition and mr addison calls a perfect tragedy the noblest production of human nature the truth of it is each person has delivered his sentiments agreeably to his own private temper and his own peculiar turn of thinking doctor south excelled in lively and surprising strokes of wit every new combination which he formed in the vivacious sallies of his imagination was epigram in itself and we find all his writings sown extremely thick with unexpected assemblages and on this account we may suppose him inclinable to extol his own favorite talent in like manner mr addison had employed many of his hours in planning his tragedy of cato and after it had received the most consummate polish which his skill could bestow upon it it was to be exhibited as the greatest production of human wit but the assertions of great men when they are unsustained by argument are not to be considered as decrees from which there can be no appeal tragedy most certainly can only claim the second place because it is manifest that all the powers of genius viz imagination eloquence and reason may be exerted in their full force in the epic composition whereas in tragedy they frequently suffer great limitation the same thing which on many occasions makes tragedy the most powerful performance serves also to divest it of those advantages which give great brilliancy to heroic poesy and that is its coming immediately before the eye it is justly remarked by horace that what is conveyed to our notice through our ears acts with a more feeble impulse upon the mind than objects that pass through the organs of sight those faithful evidences in a mental court of judicature  segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus and quae ipse sibi tradit spectator  for this reason many passages in which the epic wrietr warms and expands the imagination of his readers with the noblest exhibitions of poetic imagery are entirely excluded from the dramatic scene the eye will not suffer itself easily to be deluded and all the amazement of machinery is also for the same reason totally superseded a god says the critic should not be introduced unless the occasion should peremptorily require a supernatural agent he had said better if he had absolutely interdicted the appearance we may in reading suffer such an incident to be imposed upon us but the eye would be too much shocked with such representations and of course the mavelous is entirely banished besides tragedy will not admit any extraordinary display of pure poetry or description the heroic poet for the most part speaks in his own person and it is expected of him to pay great court to our imagination but the dialogue of personages engaged in a sphere of action intended to interest the auditors will not allow them to take up the scene with florid exhibitions of rural imagery such as brooks murmuring in scanty rills through pebbled channels etc the following lines in the mouth of calista in the fair penitent may be extremely picturesque if considered as pure description but if considered with regard to the situation of character they are certainly very inartificial and undramatic   my sad soul has formed a dismal melancholy scene an unfrequented vale over grown with trees mossy and old within whose lonesome shade ravens and birds illomend only dwell no sound to break the silence but a brook that bubbling winds among the weeds hence then we find that in the regions of fancy the drama must yield to the epic and as this is a very considerable part of poesy i think it determines the precedence in the art of eloquence and in all applications to our reason tragedy can boast full room for the most vigorous exertion the drama may be full as sentimental as any other kind of writings nay its excellence frequently consists in being so and with regard to the passions the mode of imitation renders its influence more forcible and when we are deceived into a notion that the personages are actually suffering distress before our eyes the performance assumes a kind of reality and more keen and intenser sensations agitate our breasts than in pieces where the description is left to operate upon us without any other aid than that of lively and impassioned expressions virgil i apprehend was as skilful a master of the passions as any writer ancient or modern and though the passions of his dido are drawn with as strong and glowing colorings as language can bestow though their various strugglings are all finely and closely marked though all their vicissitudes veerings and doublings if i may so call them are finely touched yet i believe shakespeares lear and othello have made much more lively and deep impressions upon an audience than ever the former has done upon his admirers in the closet  these advantages however are derived to the tragic queen from supernumerary embellishments and from the labors of another art i mean that of acting which is in itself a mode of imitation and serves to render the touches of the writer more striking and more feelingly expressive this superiority the drama certainly has over the epic and in consequence of all its additional aids it can boast a more powerful command over the human heart it imitates the very voice of nature and speaks the same simple and affecting language all that profusion of figures which mere poetry admits is discarded from the stage when i mention figures i must observe that men of critical knowledge have justly distinguished between figures of speech and figures of the sentiment the former including metaphor and all transtations of phrases and the latter consisting of such breaks and transitions in discourse as the mind is known to make when under the compunction of warring passions as for instance when the poet says of dido that she is devoured by an inward flame et caeco carpitur igne he then expresses love by a sigurative expression but when he says ignoscenda quidem scirent si ignoscere manes the repetition expresses the natural workings of the mind when other ideas are awakened and serve to excite a new conflict of passions the use of these kind of figures in tragedy should be as free and bold as possible and with respect to expression no other regard is to be paid to it than to choose such words as may be most significantly picturesque in order to have the more lively effect on the imagination the passions being then in a stronger ferment when lively images are presented to the fancy  i believe our shakespeare is almost the only poet who has excelled in a masterly power of striking the imagination the heart and our reason all at once but in him poetry sentiment and passion are combined in the most agreeable assemblage in his tragedy of macbeth there are several surprising strokes of this nature amidst a great variety of instances the following lines are introduced with a solemnity suitable to the occasion and they carry with them a pleasing kind of gloomy imagery  ever the bat has flown his clsierd flight ever to black hecates summons the shardborn beetle with his drouzy hums has rung nights yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note  the soliloquy in the tentscene of richard the third is also a further instance of the same beauty though by the way it may not be improper to observe notwithstanding we must allow that mr cibber was in the right to transplant shakespeares own words that they are not perfectly suitable to the character of richard and i believe had our great poet thought of showing his hero in this situation he would have showed richards feelings quite otherwise on such an occasion  to conclude aristotle was certainly mistaken when he called the fable the life and soul of tragedy the art of constructing the dramatic story should always be subservient to the exhibition of character our great shakespeare has breathed another soul into tragedy which has found the way of striking an audience with sentiment and passion at the same time  true intelligence early on monday morning last john bobadil the herbalist was taken in the fact of culling simples in chelsea physickgarden he was carried before a

that seems to be thoroughly acquainted with the subject an ingenious friend of mine who furnished me with an essay some time since reduces our present partydivisions into garrickeans and barryists but this is not going to the bottom of things the famous montesquien has performed in my humble apprehension as little toward a detection of the root of the evil though he seems to perceive with a kind of prophetic spirit the declension of british liberty the great lock who has treated in a very masterly manner of government does not any where give us a clue to guide our research and after glowing with bolingbroke through a number of pages we are as much in the dark as ever england can never be undone but by a parliament says the excellent author of the use and abuse of parliaments but even there we are again put upon a wrong scent the truth of the matter is england can never be undone but by the mob i am aware this may at first sight appear a paradox but a retrospect to the behavior of that body of people will convince every intelligent mind of the truth of this assertion  the generality of political writers have wasted a great deal of paper in settling the various forms of government one say they is a monocracy another is an aristocracy a third is a democracy and the british constitution they inform us is of the mixed species consisting of a coalition of all three but furely a little observation will point out to us that they have all passed by unnoticed another mode of civil policy which cannot be called by a better name than a mobocracy under which this country has been for many years past and in all human probability will continue so for a long period still to come nay i will be bold to say until monocracy aristocracy and democracy are all swallowed up by this alone  there is hardly ever a bill brought before the honorable the house of commons but the scope of it is immediately canvassed in an assembly of the mobocracy where if it passes in the negative a deputation is forthwith sent by them to the parliament house where though their remonstrances are not heard at the bar they nevertheless enforce their arguments with such a truly british eloquence that they never fail to have a due degree of influence upon the debates within doors on these occasions they generally make use of a rule of logic which indeed is not mentioned by aristotle but which is always found of great efficacy in all disputes the mode of reasoning i mean is the argumentum boculinum a nervous exertion of which accompanied with all the force of the most vigorous lungs has over ruled many an intended act when it happens not to please in the councils of the common people the mobecracy have further the legislative and executive part of their laws in their own hands and we find them very frequent in a diligent attention to them for instance though the common law of england has provided a proper punishment for pickpockets the mobocracy has reconsidered that matter and after mature deliberation have devised a correction in their opinion more adequate to the offense and whenever any one is found to incur the penalty of their law they immediately proceed to execution without judge or jury which in their apprehension serve but to retard the course of justice and therefore they seize the delinquent and without delay duck him in the river the canal in st jamess park or the next pool of water on all these occasions it is observable that they take infinite delight in seeing the proper punishment inflicted as may be observed from the acclamations the huzzas and c wherewith their burst of joy rends the air in like manner the pillory is some times ordained by the statute law of england in order to expose such transgressors as deserve to be set up the marks of public shame on every occurrence of this nature wisdom is sure to cry out in the streets and the award of the judges is determined by a popular circle to be just or unjust when once they have pronounced sentence the person doomed to make his appearance is sure either to meet with their protection or to call forth the utmost indignation of an incensed populace nay it has been known that these perpetual dictators have proceeded so far as to rescue felons condemned to suffer death from the hands of the proper officers and generously to have recalled the deathwarrant in many parts of england they have an implacable aversion to turnpikes and it is said they will never be at rest until they have entirely demolished those disagreeable passports i remember to have heard a story of these people which i think may serve to give the reader a tolerable idea of their arbitrary power not very long since three indian kings came to visit this metropolis and after they had seen most places of curiosity a play was at length advertized by command of their indian majestys the mobocracy who have entirely exploded all notions of the right divine of kings and who in fact consider crowned heads as no more than common men took care to attend at the theater royal in drury lane in order to survey the swarthy monarchs at length the curtain drew up but in vain did the players attempt to begin the diversion of the night the mobocracy who had possession of the upper gallery declared that they came to see the kings and since we have said our money the kings we will have whereupon mr wilks who was then one of the patentees came forth and assured them that the kings were in the frontbox to this the mobocracy replied that they could not see them there and defired that they should be placed in a more conspicuous point of view otherwise by g  d jack there shall be no play mr wilks who was not in his heart of mobocratical principles yet loved his own interest so well that he always knew how to be an occasional conformist assured them that he had nothing so much at heart as their happiness and accordingly got three chairs and placed the kings on the stage to the no small satisfaction of the mobocracy with whom it is a maxim to have as much as possible for their money from hence it appears that the power of the multitude is perfectly dictatorial and indeed in all ages the managers of playhouses have acquiesced under the galleryjurisdiction mr garrick i am credibly informed notwithstanding the submissive bows he occasionally makes them is not entirely reconciled to their government and it is said is very apt to quote certain treasonable words from horace implying that the vulgar have no claim to insallibility interdum vulgus rectum videt est ubi peccat my intelligence further adds that he has suppressed many schemes for adding novelty to the amusements of the public from a fear he has conceived of the manyheaded monster of the gallery nay he will at times carry matters so far as to pronounce their behavior illegal arbitrary and c and when they broke all the windows of his dwelling house so discontented a spirit possessed him that he would by no means acknowledge the justice of their proceedings  be that as it may it is certain one dissaffected person cannot withstand the mobocratical power which it is manifest has gained great strength of late years and i am persuaded will continue to flourish more and more every day they have many wise maxims by which they govern themselves such as no wooden shoes  liberty and property and no excise  no french dancers  no mounseers  let every man toast his own cheese and c such prudential axioms founded on the soberest sense must undoubtedly contribute to render their administration both wise and prosperous it does not appear that they have made any great progress in the modern art of war on the contrary there is reason to suppose that they all hold it in contempt as it is certain that on many occasions when our mixed form of government has endeavored to oppose them by sending the soldiery against them they have always laughed at the military force and repelled them from the assault without their daring to fire their military discipline seems to be derived from the romans they know no use of cannon firearms and c but proceed to battle with sticks bludgeons setting up loud shouts somewhat like the warhoop of the indians and hurling stones brickbats bottles glasses and c with tremendous force on the adverse party they are likewise totally strangers to all resinements of modern luxury bread and cheese and porter being their chief sustenance gin being only used by them when they are lowspirited or are going to be hanged they do not paint their bodies with woad like the ancient britons but generally with kenneldirt which lends them a formidable air in battle thus enured to danger it will be no wonder if the mobocracy at length becomes masters of this kingdom which as i conceive it must shortly be the case unless the vices of people of fashion should descend to them and retard them in their progress of this i must own i am inclined to cherish some hopes as i am informed that in some parts of the town they drink and game and swear and are full as wicked as the better sort of people particularly in hockly the hole i am told that they have a place called whites chocolatehouse that clean lodgings for travelers are dearer than ever and that you cannot any where shave for a penny the depravity of the times having raised the prices of every thing there as well as at the st jamess

as his leisure and abilities will permit and whatever shall be the decision of the public on his genius or inability he will stand convinced of their equity and will not suffer fond selflove to lodge an appeal in his own breast he only hopes that if the verdict be found against him it may be as in the case of elizabeth canning with this qualifying circumstance guilty of dullness but not wilful and

minus hor a ristotle informs us that homer wrote a comicepic poem entitled margites which to the no small detriment of succeeding ages is unfortunately lost to this species of poesy we may suppose comedy has the same reference that the tragic bears to the heroic for my part i cannot conceive why a good comedy has never been styled by those who are fond of deciding literary precedence the greatest production of human nature certainly its consisting of known and familiar ideas should not derogate from its merit because on account of that very circumstance it meets with less indulgence the business of it coming more near to every mans breast and of course the very vulgar being in some measure judges of the justness of the imitation whereas in tragedy frigid declamation lulls florid epithets amuse lofty metaphors amaze and sonorous expressions elevate and surprise  as tragedy aims more particularly at an excitement of the serious passions so the chief merit of comedy consists in its effect on the merry affections of the human mind the former principally awakening sensations of terro and pity and the latter giving emotions of a gay contempt as it is elegantly called or in plainer english making us despise and laugh at an object at the same time to succeed in this last mentioned mode of writing it requires as fine and as lively an imagination as any of the other imitative arts for as it is manifest that the tragic poet then excites in us the most intense sensations when his expressions convey the liveliest images to the fancy so the comic poet when he seizes the imagination with a bright assemblage of ludicrous ideas is sure of agitating those passions to which his art directs him with an irresistible power and therefore this animadversion is sufficient to put an end to that idle dispute which as we learn from horace engaged the learned viz whether comedy might be called poetry or not  quidam comoedia necne poema esset quaesivere  it is manifest that it is an imitative art and different passions being the objects of its address it only makes use of means different from the more elevated species of writing but surely it is full as hard a task to paint ordinary things as objects of more importance and in my opinion virgils line which describes an old woman running across didos apartment with officious zeal illa gradum studio celerabat anili is as picturesque and has as much merit as the description of the ambrosial locks of venus  ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem spiravere  the comic writer as well as the tragedian must derive his force from the true primary sources of composition that is to say he must learn to seize our imaginations with striking pictures of human life he must instruct our reason by inserting sensible observations on worldly contingencies and he must also frequently apply himself to those passions which it is the merit of his art to awaken in this last mentioned particular consists the real merit of a well wrought comedy in like manner as the serious drama must fill us with ideas proper to excite terror and pity to obtain either effect the poet is to select such circumstances in every object in every passion and in every action as will be most conducive to his peculiar end and he is constantly to avail himself of such expressions as will serve to convey the liveliest images to the fancy when this is rightly performed whether in the solemn or humourous scene it is true poetry and in either case it is by the means of a mode of eloquence that the art produces its desired effect for ridicule by which comedy works is as much a mode of eloquence as the several arts of persuasion and the several figures which rhetoric has reduced into a system for the excitement of the more serious passions  the dispute that subsisted among the learned for a considerable time and is perhaps not yet determined viz whether ridicule is a test of truth is in my humble opinion extremely idle and frivolous the faculty of reason which compares our ideas and fustains or rejects the various affirmations concerning them being the sole judge of truth however complicated the means may be by which it gains its end i have often wondered that neither aristotle tully nor quintilian have given a just and adequate desinition of ridicule to say that it consists in raising our laughter at some turpitude is a very insufficient account of the matter mr fulding in his preface to his joseph andrews has thrown some light upon the matter but as he places the source of it in affectation he appears to me not to have taken a comprehensive survey of his subject i apprehend the ridiculous may be formed where there is no affectation at the bottom and his parson adams i take to be an instance of this assertion  the best and most accurate desinition i have ever met with of the ridiculous is in a note of doctor akensides to his excellent poem on the pleasures of imagination that says he which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed or it is some circumstances of turpitude or deformity connected withwhat is in general excellent or beautiful the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate implying sentiment or design and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart the effect which the circumstances thus specified have upon us he thus desines the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception  the emotions here intended are laughter and contempt and these it is the business of comedy to excite by making striking exhibitions of inconsistent circumstances blended together in such a thwarting assemblage that a gay contempt irressistibly shall take possession of us to perform this in all objects which come before the comic muse in men and manners in all actions and passions requires a very delicate hand and it frequently is necessary to have an almost microscopic eye to perceive the latent inconsistency in circumstances seemingly fair and praiseworthy prion has expressed this with his usual delicacy and though the error may be such as knaggs and burgess cannot hit it yet may feel the nicer touch of wycherly or congreve s wit   in producing portraits of mankind it is not enough to display foibles and oddities a fine vein of ridicule must run through the whole to urge the mind to frequent emotions of laughter otherwise there will be danger of exhibiting disagreeable characters without affording the proper entertainment i think ben johnson extremely apt to err in this point his morose is a surly illnatured absurd humourist whom we can hardly laugh at and he soon becomes very bad company many of johnsons characters are of the same cast while in shakespeares falstaff the ridiculous ideas are placed in such an artful point of view that our merriment can never be restrained whenever sir john appears congreve in my opinion had a great deal of the same talent and what i have somewhere seen objected to him that many of his characters are obvious in human life is with me a strong proof of his superior genius an old bachelor for instance is very common but he must pass through such an imagination as congreves to support several scenes in the drama with the most exquisite pleasantry though the character was not new yet his management of it has all the graces of novelty and the situations in which we see him are all exquisitely ridiculous personages of this class unless artfully conducted may very soon tire an audience but in this excellent poets hands nothing suffers a diminution the same i think appears in his sir paul plyant in which character there is perhaps as much comic force as in any one piece on the stage sir john vanbrugh was also a perfect master of his art in this respect and of this his sir john brute is a remarkable proof the knight is constantly diverting us with an odd whimsical way of thinking which at once serves to display his own foibles and entertains his audience with a pleasantry of which he seems all along totally unconscious himself  it is therefore by placing the humors and foibles of human nature in a ridiculous light that the true comic force is created the author of the pleasures of imagination whom i have already quoted has judiciously explained each part of the desinition cited above and has finely traced the several sources from which true ridicule springs whoever chooses to consider the matter will find affectation to be but one spring however diffusive the streams of it may be to the poem itself i beg leave to refer my readers and i shall dismiss this paper with observing that the whole beauty of the comic diction consists in the words and phrases being so chosen as to give to the mind the most lively impression of known and familiar images and at the same time the strongest marks of character and each persons peculiar temper  true intelligence bedford coffeehouse aug    though

angustis hunc addere rebus honorem virg ampullas and sesquipedalia verba hor having in my last offered some cursory remarks upon ridicule i shall in this days paper take notice of a species of writing which on account of some affinity between them is often supposed to be the same with the ridiculous and yet upon an attentive view of the matter it appears to be a mode of composition introduced by men of genius in order to fall in with that propensity to laughter which prevails with all mankind in general what i here intend is burlesque to mark its boundaries its procedure and extent will be no improper subject among these essays which only pretend now and then to glance so much light upon matters of this nature as may serve to illustrate them to the unlearned  it must be remembered that as the ridiculous consists in a coalition of circumstances repugnant to each other in their own natures but yet whimsically blended together in any object any human action or passion to call forth this inconsistency to public view and to show the heterogeneous assemblage in such a manner as to provoke the mind to laugh at it with contempt is to exert the rare and excellent talent of ridicule and as this when well executed is attended with fine consequential effects the lovers of burlesque will not wait to discover a real incongruity but by the force of their own imaginations they create it for themselves and by obtruding circumstances which perhaps do not belong to the object they are frequently very successful in rendering things apparently ridiculous which to an attentive eye may not wear the motly livery however it may serve the purposes of mirth to invest it with it in order to explain more fully what is here insisted on it may not be improper to lay before the reader a few instances of the ridiculous and also of burlesque which may in some measure serve to render this matter still more intelligible and clear  when fieldings parson adams in distress at an inn retires very gravely with a london bookseller to raise money upon some manuscript sermons i believe the dissonant circumstances in this case strike very forcibly and our laughter is still urged with greater impetuosity when after having traveled a great many miles from his own place of abode toward london with no other business upon earth but to dispose of these sermons we hear the parson not being able to find them very gravely say i protest i believe i left them behind me when the same personage assures us that he is very rich and then adds that he does not say it by way of boasting or complying with worldly vanity but to show that he can live well on the road and to confirm this produces half a guinea the difference between his opinion and the small value of the piece and this too from a clergyman a scholar and in many things a man of excellent understanding produces an emotion of laughter attended in this instance with a contempt for adamss want of knowledge of the world in like manner when don quixote very gravely says that he has seen the sea and that it is much larger than the river at la mancha we cannot help laughing at a man who has formed his ideas of things by what he has seen at his own native place and to find an insignisicant river compared to the sea presents such a repugnant conjunction of images as must necessarily operate upon our risible faculties  these instances which have first among a thousand offered themselves to my memory are true instances of the ridiculous nothing here being obtruded upon our imaginations but in burlesque there are many adventitious ideas called up in order to form a motly concurrence of thwarting images and so produce the same effect with the really ridiculous as for instance if any object which comes before the burlesque writer be low in its own nature he immediately bethinks himself of conferring on it a mock dignity in which it begins to look big like the champion at a coronation who boldly challenges all mankind when he knows no body will fight him i have ever been highly pleased with a touch of this kind in a note to mr fieldings tom thumb where mentioning something of the soul of man he gravely tells us plato is of this opinion and so is mr banks the stroke in the beggars opera is of the same nature  there is nothing so moving as a great man in distress in this case the great disproportion between the two objects strikes our imagination and our laughter bursts out at that which is without foundation set in competition in the following passage of the poet it seems to me there is a ridiculous appearance intended by giving a mock majesty to an object in the general opinion not so highly exalted  oh could i view through london as i pass some broad sir balaam in corinthian brass high on a pedestal ye freemen place his magisterial paunch and griping face lettered and gilt let him adorn cheapside and grant the tradesman what a kings denied thus the ludicrous assemblage is formed by an association of ideas which we are diverted to see joined together the other method of burlesque is if an object has any thing respectable about it to join it with images not only inferior but in themselves contemptible mr pope is very frequent in this kind of satyr throughout his dunciad and boileau is i think admirable in both species of burlesque in his lutrin our own garth also has many beautiful passages in his dispensary where a ridicule is thrown upon his heroes by associating with them images of things to which some kind of turpitude is adherent thus a set of physicians quarrelling among themselves are finely placed in a ludicrous light by the following humourous simile  thus often at the temple stairs we have seen two tritons of a rough athletic mien sourly dispate some quarrel of the flood with knuckles bruised and face besmeared with blood but at the first appearance of a fare both quit the fray and to their oars repair another very common method of burlesque is by making frequent application of grand and sublime passages in our best poets to things unworthy and mean bioleau is in my opinion the happiest of all modern poets in this particular as passages of this nature are frequently mistaken for an intent to burlesque the author from whom the image is borrowed it may not be improper in this place to observe that parody does not always carry with it any sneer at the author parodied the best lines in virgil may be aptly applied to other objects without his being burlesqued and we find that vida in his elegant and beautiful poem on the game of chess has almost in every line surprised us with expressions from the aeneid by which means he gives spirit and life to his poem animates his imaginary warriors with human passions and fills the fancy with entertaining ideas of mock heroic majesty the description of the havoc at a game of chess is perfectly elegant sternitur omne solum buxo atque miserrima caedes exoritur confusa inter sese agmina caedunt implicitaeque ruunt albae nigraeque phalanges sternuntur pedites and corpora quadrupedantum the description of the queen is also highly beautiful at medias inter acies crudescit amazon candida plena animis mediisque in millibus ardet it is plain that mr pope in his account of a game at cards in the rape of the lock has imitated this excellent poet in his manner of exalting inanimate things which can never carry with it any air of burlesque because nothing can be ridiculous but when a free agency is applied  but in burlesque as in every other kind of writing truth should be the foundation otherwise the superstructure must fall like arisiophaness ridicule of socrates which is now held in contempt as will always be the case with every piece of illfounded pleasantry because the object thus attacked must be always exceptionable otherwise it can never be essentially hurt by a false combination of adventitious ideas as there is a strong propensity in the generality of people to this kind of humor tragic poets in particular should be cautious how by any passage or expression they excite ludicrous images if once in the most serious scene a wrong association of ideas be formed the mind is apt to attach itself to the object of its mirth and thus a wellimagined plece may be obstructed a very elegant critic observes that the following line of dryden a star light morning and an evening fair has in it nothing improper and yet if any one recollects that a starlight morning is the language of a watchman it may occasion some sprightly raillery on this account in all the different species of composition the writer must carefully remember to keep within his proper boundaries because the least excursion too far may be highly prejudicial and give room to small wits either to point incongruous circumstances or to obtrude them upon the readers imagination  true intelligence from my own apartment aug    the account which i gave lately of my intentions to abdicate

themselves sorry for my approaching silence the grays inn journal being as they assure me the life of their coffeeroom there are many persons of such cool and serious understandings that they cannot approve any thing but what is strictly and literally true these an ingenious friend of mine calls matter of fact men and by one of this class i am told in very plain terms that he is glad i am going

secret of authorship begs of me to recommend him to my publisher that he may carry on the paper the ensuing winter but in this point i must desire to be excused as i should not choose to have my plan eked out beyond its proper bounds and i therefore take this opportunity to entreat that elegant writer who has for some time past assumed the name of ranger not to lay any of his foundlings at my door when once i shall have made my bow to the public such a procedure would be highly illiberal and i hope i need not say any thing further on this head but to the soft the obliging the lovely the courtly

 virg it is a general complaint made by my fair countrywomen that the gentlemen regardless of that respect and attention which are at all times due to their charms show a great averseness to their company i fear this charge cannot be controverted and am sorry to see the truth manisested in the constrained deportment in elegant address and uncouth attempts at politeness that almost universally characterize the youth of this island  certain it is that a frequent liberal intercourse with that more refined part of our species which is happily described by the appellation of the beau sex so powerfully influences not only our manner and behavior but our way of thinking that from thence we acquire a certain delicacy of sentiment which extends itself even to the most minute circumstances of life and from hence it is that our neighbors the french have established throughout europe that character of politeness which we do not choose to be at the trouble of emulating as we find it much more easy to ridicule and laugh at it my lord anglois while the profusion with which he disperses his guineas creates astonishment in the mechanics of paris conscious of a desiciency in that ease and elegant freedom which he observes in every man of education whom he meets shuns all good company and after reluctantly spending three months between the hotel and the several places of public diversion returns to his native soil strongly impressed with the most contemptuous idea of the french whom though he has but literally seen he takes the liberty to describe as a superficial volatile nation for no other reason perhaps than that they are perfectly skilled in the most entertaining i had almost said useful art that invention can suggest which is to trisle agreeably  a frenchman has no more idea of a party of pleasure without ladies than an englishman can entertain the least conception of enjoying himself until they retreat from those opposite dispositions it arises that the first introduces himself with a becoming unconcern into company and master of that bienseance which distinguishes the gentleman and performs all offices of life without the least embarassment whereas nothing is more common among us than to find gentlemen of family and fortune who know nothing of the fairsex but what they have collected from the most abandoned part of it and can scarce reckon a virtuous family within the whole scope of their acquaintance it is not unpleasant to observe one of this class when chance or necessity has brought him into a room with ladies of reputation an awkward restraint hangs about him and he is almost afraid to speak least he should inadvertently bolt out something which though extremely suitable to the dialect of covent garden would be grossly offensive to those females who had not received their rudiments of education in that seminary the gloom that hangs over an english company while the ladies remain and the reciprocal restraint that each sex seems to be upon the other has been frequently a subject of ludicrous observations to foreigners and indeed the fairones themselves though natives and to the manner born frequently express astonishment what mysteries the men can have to celebrate so opposite to those of the bona dea that no female must be present at the ceremony i am not at liberty to divulge this important secret but will for the satisfaction of the ladies assure them that they are not of a nature vastly beyond their apprehension nay on the contrary may be casily understood even by a miss in hangingsleeves provided she has had the happiness of a boardingschool education  at the same time that i condemn my countrymen for separating themselves from those who have the art of refining every joy this world affords i am sorry to be obliged to observe that the ladies themselves do in some measure contribute to this great evil the scandalcus practice so prevalent at present of giving up their whole thoughts as well as time to cards has made the company of women pardon the expression extremely insipid to those who would willingly consider them as rational creatures and do not depend upon superior skill in the game of whist for a subsistence is it to be imagined that a man whose mind is the least raised above the vulgar will devote that time which he may employ in conversing agreeably either with the dead or the living to those assemblies where no ideas enter beyond the respective excellencies of garrick and barry and the several possible cases so profoundly calculated by the incomparable mr hoyle yet from declining these places i know many intimate friends who have acquired the odious character of womenhaters though at the same time they entertain the highest esteem for that amiable sex and sincerely regret that the tyrant fashion has put it out of their power to enjoy more of their company than a bare view of their persons agitated by the various and uncertain revolutions of fortunes wheel  besides what i have already mentioned another obstacle extremely pernicious to society proceeds from the excessive officiousness of the female world in cuting out matches mr pope has observed that every women is at heart a rake and i believe it is not less true though i fear the assertion will be much more offensive to the virgins of britain that every woman is a fortunehunter this character is deservedly infamous in the male part of the creation and we detest the man though of an exceeding good family in ireland who aided by the friendship and confidence of his tailor makes a pompous display of the breadth of his shoulders and the firmness of his calves but conceive no indignation against the lovely nymph who undresses herself in the same view with the most seducing art and generously much too generously for her own interest exhibits every charm the happy man will be possessed of who takes her to his posom the idea of entrapping somebody mixes so intimately with the general cast of thought in women that they can never divest themselves of it and if a gentleman pays that compliment to their beauty which female pride would never pardon if he had omitted they immediately flatter themselves that he must have a design of marriage this notion once conceived a convocation of aunts old maids discreet friends prudent neighbors etc is assembled when every circumstance must be discussed  miss intimates  he is very particular to me  what can he mean  he looked at me all the time he was here  sure he will propose soon  then did you remark aunt betty when we talked of marriage what he said  he certainly means to have me  the result of this consultation is that miss must carry it with a proper reserve in order to compel the imaginary lover to declare himself who if he be a man of experience in the subtleties of women instantly sees through the flimsy artifice and discontinues his visits i submit to the candor of every female reader whether i have here drawn an ideal picture  can these angelic beings reasonably expect then that a man will choose to visit them under the disagreeable alternative of behaving continually with a ceremonious distance or running the risk of being driven to the necessity of an awkward explanation  no while narrow sentiments of this kind prevail it will be impossible to introduce a truly social converse between the sexes which must be effected on the part of the ladies by an undesigning decent freedom the inseparable companion of real virtue  let them assert their own dignity and manifest a consciousness that they were not created merely to be  umental in the continuation of the species but are endowed with intellectual faculties that qualify them for the sweet joys of society let them at length so far undeceive themselves as to think that a man may like their company admire their virtues nay even their personal charms and cherish the warmest friendship for them without any intention of addressing them on the score of love let them but offer this violence to the natural vanity of their sex and i will undertake to promise that they will not long have reason to complain of being neglected  men of sse will then seek their company and what i hope may make some impression on a semale mind will then think of them as partners for life  true intelligence extract of a letter

at the same time all works that have the least ray of genius according as they happen to dislike the authors face or that of the bookseller who may have purchased the copy etc  being all severally asked they pleaded not guilty then the attorney general of the court opened the prosecution with the following speech  gentlemen of the jury  the several misdemeanors of the psendocritics who now stand at the bar of this honorable court are of as glaring a die as ever came under the cognizance of a seat of judicature intended to be supplemental to the laws of the land it is observed by mr pope  less dangerous is the offense to tire our patience than mislead our sense   now i appeal to the impartial opinion of every reader who has thought it worth his while to turn over the leaves of the monthly review whether more malicious false and illgrounded criticisms were ever sent abroad into the world since the days of zoilus down to the present era of these notable reviewers i am persuaded gentlemen of the jury that a more gross imposition was never offered to the republic of letters than for a bookseller whose sign is justly emblematical of his authors viz the dunciad to take upon him to dictate to the public in a work conducted by obscure hirelings country schoolmasters etc certain it is that a critical performance under the direction of gentlemen and scholars written with taste impartiality and erudition might be highly serviceable to the cause of literature a man for instance who should give such an account of works of taste as pere brumoy has of the greek dramatic poets would deserve to be cherished by the public and the bookseller who should publish such a performance would acquire honor and reputation in his business but as matters have been managed by the reviewers it is manifest that the whole is a mere job eternally swelled out with dull extracts from dull authors calculated to serve the purposes of a few publishers and to misguide the public taste the frequent abuses of the liturgy the arguments for abolishing the athanasian creed and the scandalous treatment of many clergymen of the church of england are strong indications of the hand of a fanatic and the idle strictures of natural history fossils minerals etc are infallible marks of a certain exploded herbalist who has reduced himself to the lamentable situation described by a great genius when he says there is not a more miserable figure than a man who has wrote himself down it is therefore submitted to the common sense of mankind whether it is not the highest presumption in a set of hirelings to impose on the judgment of their unfortunate readers by a gross misrepresentation of all compositions according as they are directed by a spirit of malevolence or partiality to usurp the seat of criticism without declaring who and what they are without producing their credentials to show the world by what authority they act and without previously giving undeniable proofs of their own ability and taste according to the statute of mr pope let such teach others who themselves excel and censure freely who have written well   that not one of the authors of the review have

of holding an intercourse with obscure hackney scribblers who deal out malice and invective by the sheet whereupon the council against the prosecution declared they had nothing further to offer in favor of their clients and the judge proceeded to give his charge to the jury declaring the monthly review to be an insult on the understandings of all the good people of great britain calculated to serve the purposes of booksellers and gratify the resentment of bad authors who as mr pope observes are generally bad men  he declared the arbitrary proceeding of the prisoners at the bar to be very

degeneracy of the times each individual of society charitably judging himself excepted from the general reproach assumes a privilege to inveigh against the vices of the age and the total decline from those virtues which immortalized the exalted characters of antiquity and enabled the ancestors of the present race of englishmen to deliver down to posterity a constitution which still renders them the envy of the world  this splenetic humor of decrying the moderns is become so universal that all ranks and orders of men seem more or less infected by it the divine pathetically bewails the shameful neglect of religion the patriot laments that venality and corruption have irretrievably extinguished the genuine spirit of liberty the philosopher sighs that enthusiasm and superstition should have usurped the throne of free enquiry and debased the intellectual faculties the fair complain that the dissolute inclinations of the men compel them to drag out an uncomfortable life in celibacy while the men in their turn pour out the most bitter invectives against the extravagance and dissipation of the other sex which they would have the world believe are risen to such an excess that the word matrimony carries with it the idea of bankruptcy and ruin nay so far has the influence of this infatuation reached that it is become very common for even stockjobbers to assert that things are not now as they have been  nothing is to be done now  the prokerage in and out runs away with all the profit whereas in king williams time when the government was distressed for money and necessitated to give six per cent upon a loan great strokes were to be made  in order therefore to show the unreasonableness as well as disingenuity of this epidemic dissatisfaction with the age in which i had the happiness to be born i shall endeavor to demonstrate and i flatter myself i shall be able to do it beyond all possibility of doubt that the now exining inhabitants of great britain so far from being inferior to their illustrious predecessors do at this day surpass the ancients in all the admired virtues and qualifications which the most enthusiastic idolizer of antiquity shall be able to point out  in the first place socrates plato cicero and some few others of remote antiquity are frequently celebrated for that amazing strength of mind which enabled them to detect the impostures of the religion established in the country where they were born and empowered them to break through the impediments which superstition and priestcrast had placed in the avenues to truth but surely the insignificant number of instances that ancient history furnishes of those trulyphilosophic characters however respectable the names may be will little deserve our attention when we consider how infinitely the present age eclipses their claim of superiority in this respect is there a gentleman at this day any way conversant in polite life who does not entertain the greatest contempt for the prejudices or faith as it is vulgarly called in which he was educated are not the coffeehouses about temple bar nay even in the city so many seminaries where our youth discuss the most important questions of philosophy and explode the errors imposed on mankind for so many centuries nor is this knowledge as among the ancients the result of tedious enquiry and meditation but entirely intuitive being most eminent in those who are almost totally void of the least acquisition in any branch of literature and indebted to nature alone for their astonishing discoveries  the advocate for antiquity will perhaps thunder out an eulogium on the exalted virtue and patriotism of cato brutus and several other illustrious romans who prodigal of life disdained to survive the liberties of their country but certainly there can be no room to run a parallel the advantage is so obviously on the side of the moderns those ingenious historians the daily newswriters in every page of their works afford us examples of the noblest disregard of death the roman voluntarily quits the world because he could not bear to be a witness of the slavery of his country but the englishman puts a period to his existence because the fogs of november depress his spirits and he scorns to be compelled to live longer than life continues agreeable how noble is this spirit of freedom which is not confined to people of birth and education but extends itself to the lowest mechanics insomuch that my lord is not more ready to discharge a pistol through his brain than his barber in short the point is so extremely clear that it would be quite superfluous to labor at the proof of it and i may venture to assert that no nation of which history has preserved the least record has any pretension to dispute the glory of suicide with england  i am aware that great stress may be laid upon the literary merit of the ancients and expect to hear the names of aristotle longinus and quintilian thrown out with an exulting air of triumph far be it from me to attempt to derogate from the long established fame of those great men undoubtedly they were very good critics for the times in which they lived but with all due respect to those celebrated geniusses we may take the liberty to suppose that the art of criticism must be now much better understood than it possibly could be in their days as it is much more universally studied attorneys clerks mercers apprentices and merchants bookkeepers in this year      credit posteri are thoroughly qualified to pronounce in the most decisive manner upon the merit of all literary compositions particularly dramatic poetry the noblest province of polite learning not to mention that we have found out the absurdity and shook off the restraint of those fetters which the stagyrite would rivet on us and transferred them to our gallic neighbors a nation inured to and patient of slavery  should any discontented or disappointed politician after poring over livy insinuate that mankind are not now as they were in the times of the roman republic when private considerations always gave way to the public good i would only desire such a phlegmatic murmurer to look through the kingdom and observe what a number of gentlemen have impaired their estates and destroyed the tranquillity and happiness of their families in order to procure a seat in the representativeassembly of the nation undoubtedly with no other view but that they might be watchful over the liberties of their country  some mercantile cynic dissatisfied with an unruly son who finds more charms within the regions of covent garden than the counting house will perhaps pay little regard to what i have hitherto advanced and exclaim that the spirit of industry is quite lost and people of this age regard nothing but pleasure  but the injudice of this censure would evidently appear to this narrowminded citizen if the next time he went to the pit at drury lane with his wife and daughters on a saturday he would take the trouble to make enquiry concerning the most gay and brilliant personages in the boxes he could then be informed that they are gentlemen by way of eminence distinguished by the appellation of knights of industry who without any visible means of subsistence enjoy all the pleasures of this metropolis in the most elegant manner and run into expenses which few men of real fortune can support  let us now turn our view to the amiable sex and enter into a comparison between the females of ancient times and the present ladies of great britain in what an honorable light will our countrywomen appear in vain shall the pedant who derives his knowledge solely from books harangue upon the conjugal attachment of roman matrons while we can mention numberless british wives who at this day with unexampled unanimity go hand in hand with their husbands in pursuit of the grand business of life mean gaming which mr pope in his usual emphatic manner calls the nations last great trade nor should the candor and disinterestedness of the virgins of this island want that encomium which justice cannot refuse plutarch insorms us that lycurgus ordered the spartan nymphs to appear at the public exercises in garments made with artificial openings in different parts in order that the lacedaemonian youth might be captivated by a seemingly accidental discovery of their charms but our fair ones disdaining so disingenuous a proceeding and scorning to take advantage of the illusion of imagination which inflamed by a transient glympse is apt to form enthusiastic ideas of hidden beauty show things as they really are and by making a generous display of all their charms leave no room to their future husbands to complain that they were deceived in their expectations  these examples which i have brought in support of the proposition i undertook to prove will sufficiently evince to every impartial mind that the pretended preeminence of greece and rome over britain has no other foundation than prepossession and envy and all unprejudiced readers must acquiesce in the truth of the observation made with great insight into human nature by the elegant historian from whom i have taken the motto of this paper  we are naturally more ready to do justice to what we hear of than to what we see cotemporary merit excites our envy but that of ancient times

charles ranger esquire sir i cannot but very much approve that spirit of patriotism which seems to have inspired the essay of last saturday the generality of mankind are slavishly attached to established prejudices and it must be a strong and manly genius that will dare to examine received opinions and boldly assert the truth against popular sentiments and vulgar error this mr ranger you have performed very eminently in your last paper and as i entirely coincide with your way of thinking i beg leave to address this letter to you as a supplement to what you have there advanced  i must avow that i entirely agree with you that the moderns have in every thing greatly exceeded the admired ancients if the latter boast their plato we have our lord shaftsbury and if the death of cato is justly styled by the poet catonis nobile letum because he would not survive the loss of liberty is it not much more heroic in a modern cobbler to dispatch himself for on other reason but that he does not like the weather or in a nobleman to cut his throat because he has lost the odd trick at whist in addition to this it must be considered that few instances of this sort of fortitude are ecorded among the romans whereas i am credibly informed by a very sensible man and one of the coroners inquest that there does not pass by a single day without his being called to turvey the glorious relics of a selfdevoted tailor shoemaker etc the same person assures me at the same time that not a tenth part of those exalted minds have the due honors paid to their memory by the public news papers but are permitted to remove themselves from human life in the same silence as if they had quietly passed through nature to eternity and never dared to fly in the face of their maker but to set this matter in the clearest point of view i shall here draw up a catalogue of whatever may seem to give the ancients a claim to our preference contrasted with a list of modern improvements upon a fair inspection of which i flatter myself the laurel will by every impartial reader be adjudged to the present age  ancient catalogue   aristotle   hippocrates   socrates   tully   cato uticensis   epictetuss morals   the stoics the skeptics the peripatetics the acedemics the epicureans etc etc   dionysius halicarnassensis longinus quintilian   a secession of the romana plebs  0 the eleusinian mysteries    balnea romana    the olympic games    platos symposion    senatus populusque romanus modern catalogue   doctor hill   doctor rock   whitfield   orator henley   englishmen that hang and drown themselves

bagnios    newmarket races    the club at whites    o the roast beef of old england without adding any supernumerary articles i think it is marifest from the above state of the case that the moderns can easily balance the scale with the so much celebrated ancients but the matter does not rest here mr ranger i am convinced we can throw in several circumstances which will greatly entitle us to the preeminence as for instance i do not find that they had an atheist among them and surely the character of an atheist must in the eyes of all men of sense do very great honor to the present age the tenets of his philosophy being entirely new and such as were not discovered by plato tully socrates or any of the ancient philosophers that happy discovery being reserved for the present age so much enlightened as a great genius says in all true philosophy add to this what has been already urged on a similar occasion the ancients were totally ignorant of the laws of england and i believe it cannot be denied but the common law of england is by many degrees preferable to the laws of solon or any other legislator as it is founded upon the sure basis of common sense intelligible to the meanest capacity without much study and full as easy in the practice as in the theory i must acknowledge that i have read in livy and sallust some random accounts of the contempt the candidates had in rome for money upon all elections for the consulship the tribuneship etc this procedure among them was styled by the illnatured by the name of ambitus and by the rigid among the moderns bribery and corruption but to divest things of odious appellations the public and benevolent spirit of our countrymen at a general election cannot be parallelled any where in the roman page the ancients occasionally make a murmur concerning a matter which they call nequissima faenora but it will need no force of argument to prove that usury has attained to a greater degree of profusion among the moderns how many young heirs are ruined with us before they come to years of discretion not to mention that they had not the faintest idea of the stocks jonathans coffeehouse change alley the southseahouse the indiahouse rescounters directors brokers etc that the romans were a very exponsive people is very well known to mr ranger and every one who has dipped into vertots revolutions or the famous montesquieus causes of the declension of the roman empire notwithstanding this i have the pleasure to congratulate my countrymen on our owing so many millions of money and i persuade myself every one of my readers will allow that the national debt gives us a very great advantage over the ancients i am not ignorant that sallust mentions public egestatem privatim opulentiam public penury and private opulence but sir i appeal to you whether we have not both these more glaringly than appears any where in the roman history though i should be sorry to be guided by a national partiality in this matter yet i cannot but think our national debt is as remarkable a thing as i ever read of in history and as to private wealth the infinite sums of money laid out in artificial falls of water artificial canals and indeed in artificial wine etc most evidently evince our superiority moreover i apprehend the ancients were entire strangers to routs and drums not to mention two or three hundred cardtables in one house i do not think that they seem to have the faintest idea of an e o table of reversing of forcing of finessing of seesawing and the many elegant turns in the game of whist picquet brag backgammon cribbidge are not even mentioned in the slightest manner and i flatter myself i may say without the danger of a controversy that the discoveries made by mr hoyle in the doctrine of chances by far exceed their deepest researches in the mathematics  to give the argument another turn the beauty the elegance and manners of our british ladies give a surprising luster to the present age horace informs us matronae praeter faciem nil cernere possis caetera ni catia est demissa vest tegentis a matron never shows any part of her person except her face they being all studious unless it be catia to cover the rest of their amiable bodies with a garment catia it seems then is a singular instance but how different is the conduct of the matrons of the modern times they have all happily emerged from the ruff of queen bess and their chief endeavor is to display all their charms to full view had this fashion prevailed among the ancient ladies i conceive a naked venus would not have been so great a rarity indeed in england some remains of this false modesty prevailed not very long since in consequence of which mr pope has finely said if queensbury to strip there is no compelling it is from a handmaid we must take an helen but happily future painters will not be reduced to such difficulties as the modern ladies are daily stripping as fast as they can and the visible approaches of the amiable sex to a general nakedness cannot fail to give a luster to my fair countrywomen beyond all greek and roman fame the tendency to undressing is so strong at present that i make no doubt but the time will come in a period not far distant when miss in her teens will cry out lard mamma i have been reading the world or the graysinn journal but they are so full of hard cramp words i cannot think what to make of em  pray mamma what can they mean by stays  really child says mamma i cannot say for certain but if one may conjecture i should imagine that in those days the women wore something about their bodies as high from the waist up as the pit of their stomach  he he he mamma what a ridiculous fashion that must be what has a woman a fine skin for but to show it or if she has not a fine skin what has she paint for but to make a fine skin and then mamma what could the petticoat be  why child it looks as if in those days they wore a covering for their limbs down from the waist as low as the ankle  he he he says miss what has a woman legs for but to show em and then mamma i suppose by crownwhist that the people in those days were so penurious and so pitiful and so careful as only to play for crowns  yes child says mamma that is pretty plain and keeping sundays was then made a crime and three hundred cardtables was then counted a thing of consequence  well mamma i am as glad as any thing i was not born in those grave formal times  this or something not unlike it will most assuredly be the language of the rising generation and if improvements are made in other branches such as the national debt atheism etc i persuade myself that whatever the admirers of the ancients may urge at present our superiority will then be incontestible  pleased with the prospect of this happy period i will here lay down my pen and subscribe myself mr rangers  most obedient and very humble servant a modern philosopher   true

shall make no apology for having been occasionally caught nodding on the contrary i shall make an account of the various occurrences i lately met with in my sleep the subject of this days paper  i dreamt that being on board a merchantman upon a voyage which indispensible business obliged me to make we were drove by distress of weather far to the southward in the great pacific ocean and that in the nightime we were suddenly thrown on the shore of an island totally unknown to the ships crew while they were next morning all hands at work to get off the ship i adventured farther up into the country and had not journeyed far when i perceived myself to be in the land of the houyhnhnms mentioned by capt gulliver in his travels and in a little time methought i met with the same master houyhnhnm with whom that accurate traveller so long conversed as he had before seen one of my species i was freed from the disagreeable circumstances of being stared at and showed about in the manner we do a tall man or a short woman in england the master houynhnhnm immediately took me into a private apartment and began to question me concerning the state of europe and that of great britain in particular he asked me whether the same vices were still in fashion among us and more especially whether that list of enormities which gulliver had mentioned to him were still continued in practice such as robbing stealing cheating pimping forswearing flattering suborning forging gaming lying fauning hectoring voting scribbling stargazing poisoning whoreing canting libelling freethinking and the like i told him they flourished with as much if not more vigor than ever and that two of them viz gaming and libelling increased and gathered strength every day that there are several in the metropolis of great britain who professedly live by them that in order to carry on the former viz gaming with alacrity there are several societies formed where they meet with a design upon one anothers pockets which was introductory of another crime not mentioned by gulliver viz suicide this i took some pains to explain and then he fetched a deep groan at the pride and arrogance of human nature i added that the female yahoos amongst us were all turned absolute gamesters and kept routs drums hurricanes etc for the purposes of play i remember i had a very sensible pleasure in calling the fair gamesters by the name of female yahoos because i really think that term very aptly appropriated to them when they relinquish their native delicacy and become a prey to all the tormenting passions of gaming i further informed the master houyhnhnm that libelling is now in greater vogue than ever and that a society was formed for that purpose by a set of scribblers who call themselves critical and monthly reviewers and from their obscure haunts attack the reputation of every man whom they dislike for no motive except that strong antipathy which dullness and malice always have to genius and a fair fame the worthy houyhnhnm here fetched a second groan hurt by a reflection on the baseness of human nature he then enquired about his former acquaintance capt gulliver and said he looked upon him to be exempt from all the mean fordid vices of his species whereupon i informed him that gulliver was only that celebrated persons traveling name that in europe he was known by the immortal name of doctor swift as i am particularly fond of the writings of that great genius and never travel without them i informed the houyhnhnm that i had his works in my chest and if he would permit me to return to the ship i would have the honor of presenting them to him this proposal was perfectly agreeable and in a little space of time i came back with that elegant edition of swifts works lately published by mr hawksworth in a few days he read over the best part of his works and was delighted with most of them but more particularly with the faithful account of the conversation he formerly had with him which he said was set down without the least deviation from truth he added that the account prefixed by mr hawksworth of the authors life was an admirable composition i observe said he that my old acquaintance gulliver or swift was at once an instance of the dignity and the imbecility of human nature and the writer of his life i am persuaded must have both a clear head and a good heart because his style is properly concise and always clear strong and harmonious and it is with a very perceptible regret that he speaks of the infirmities of his author he seems tenderly to fling them into shades to soften away every thing unamiable and to place his good qualities in the most glaring light finding the worthy houyhnhnm to be very much pleased with this performance of mr hawksworth i made him a present of the adventurer in four volumes which he received with a seeming avidity and chancing to light upon the eastern story of carazan the merchant of bagdat he confessed himself delighted with the moral which it inculcates and amazed at his warmth and sublimity of imagination  the houyhnhnm observed when i presented the above books to him that i dropped a paper and in some confusion hastily snatched it up this paper was no other than mr ponss list of the horses that run at new market which i was desirous to conceal from him but being urged to show it he laughed at the whimsicalness of the conceit as he supposed it to be and he wondered mr pons would say the thing which was not i assured him of the veracity of the account and told him however incredible it might appear that jockeys rid horses or houyhnhnms at full speed for wagers in many other places in england and that even the first noblemen would frequently ride their own horses and appear at a great meeting no better than jockeys and grooms to convince him further of the great perfection we have attained in the management of horses i produced to him a new system of horsemanship from the french of monsieur bourgela by richard berenger esquire he at first laughed at the impracticability of the scheme but upon my assuring him that the whole was sounded on the justest observation he immediately sent for another houyhnhnm and ordered me to mount him in order to show him the efficacy of the rules in vain i endeavored to decline it by apologies for my own want of dexterity to encourage me he bid the houyhnhnm not do me a mischief and i was obliged to vault into the saddle where i fixed myself upon the twist with a proper grasp or hold and that too without employing any strength but trusting entirely to the balance of my body i employed a quick and feeling hand and then made him advance go back turn to the right and lest according to my own will and pleasure the master houyhnhnm was surprised to see me have so absolute a command the volte the demivolte the gallop the several passades the terreaterre the mezair the curvet etc were matters of astonishment to him and when i alighted the houyhnhnm which i rode declared that several times his pride being picqued he attempted to fling me but that by a quick turn of the wrist he found his power totally taken away from him the master again carried me into his apartment and after expressing a due degree of astonishment surely said he the person who can thus in so elegant and perspicuous a manner put together a system of rules for subduing the noble race of houyhnhnms must make great seize whenever he turns his thoughts to other matters i answered that his conjecture was perfectly just that the author had published that performance because riding is his favorite exercise and that it is to be hoped he will some day handle other topics with that taste and delicacy with which this composition shows he can treat ordinary things  no doubt says the huyhnhnm when he thus touches on what it seems in england is but the common business of life but he must display great elegance when he discusses matters of more refinement i own i should be glad to converse with him though i consider him as a kind of enemy and i hope he is a seafaring man that i may have some chance of seeing him here one time or other upon hearing the author was designed by birth genius and education to shine in another sphere he declared himself sorry and in compliance with my request gave me leave to return to the ship which was by this time got off the shore i therefore kissed his hoof which he raised for me as he formerly did to gulliver and after desiring his compliments to the editor of swifts works and the author of the system of horsemanship he dismissed me with a serious admonition to avoid the meannesses and the several fordid vices of human nature whereupon i took my final leave and returned to my companions we sailed with a prosperous wind and meeting but few accidents in our voyage in a short time arrived at gravesend my joy at finding myself once more in old england was so great that i expressed myself in the language of the country i came from and awakened out of my sleep crying out houyhnhnm  true intelligence from my own apartment sept         as this is the last opportunity i shall have of giveing articles of true intelligence i have determined to give the precedence in this days paper to a succinct account of the proceedings at a court of censorial enquiry against the author of this paper i flatter myself that by these means the exceptions which may have been taken to these little compositions will be stated in a fair light and the writers conduct throughout his undertaking put beyond the reach of calumny or detraction  court of censorial enquiry wednesday sept    this day charles ranger esquire appeared at the bar of this court upon an indictment found against him for that he wantonly and indiscreetly from time to time in his grays inn journal made too free with characters which had not offended him to the great uneasiness of the persons so attacked and against the statute recorded by horace sublato jure nocendi etc  ranger objected to several who were summoned to be on the jury offering various reasons as occasion required such as dullness ignorance prejudice etc at length this point being adjusted the cause was opened by counselor fester who spared neither elocution nor eloquence to inflame the mind of the court and the gentlemen impanelled against the prisoner at the bar many instances he insisted could be pointed out of personal resentment and malice prepense etc after which several passages of rangers writings were read in court and several witnesses appeared to enforce the charge exhibited against him  among these were quinbus flestrin from the bedford coffee house bob nankeen not pigtail harry lappel jack oakstick jemmy scratch from the city mr mac gregor mr broadbrim mr shallow etc from the robinhood society mons bourguignon mons languedoc mons bernard mons soup meagre etc from toms in cornhill and slaughters in st martins lane moses aminadab selim levi rubens shylock etc from dukesplace and some others from various parts of the town all these deposed that the prisoner had indulged himself in frequent strokes of pleasantry upon them and they therefore hoped the jury would bring in a verdict accordingly  prisoners defense may it please this honorable court and you gentlemen of the jury  the imputation of wantonly making free with characters that had not given any personal offense is a point i must speak a few words to because i think it a very fallacious argument and if it be supposed to carry any weight it may be sufficient to tie up the hands of every satyrist it is not necessary that a ridiculous character should tread upon an authors toe or offend him in some other manner without that he is free game for every sportsman of the quil and that this is mr popes opinion appears from the following lines and must no egg in japhet s face be thrown because the deed he forged was not my own   i must farther declare before this honorable court that i never saw one of these gentlemen who have appeared against me in my life  their faces their persons their characters are to me perfectly unknown and therefore i presume it may be fairly inferred that i never meant to give the least annoyance to any one in particular  they were all personages of my own creation and something like them i imagined might exist in nature and therefore i fansied i had a right to lash or banter any vice or folly under imaginary names without intending a personal application in any one instance having said thus much i think it unnecessary in so plain a cafe to take up the time of the court to whose equitable decisions i implicitly resign myself  hereupon the jury withdrew and in a few minutes brought in their verdict not guilty to the great satisfaction of ranger and his friends and the disappointment of the group of witnesses mentioned above the lord chief justice of the court then broke his staff declared his commission to be annulled and the censorial court was finally dismissed   numb  0  graysinn saturday oct        frange miser calamos vigilataque praelia dele qui facis in parva sublimia

and most glowing pleasures our constitutions can admit doubts and fears may arise but they are soon quenched by sanguine hope success hovers over the young schemists head fame stands in a corner of the picture which fond fancy has framed blowing her immortal trumpet and happiness and gay serenity dart in sprightly vibrations through his soul happy were the golden dream never to evaporate but clouds arise that blot the intellectual radiance and as soon as the beams of imagination are diminished the passions like flowers at the setting sun immediately are contracted the spirits that expanded every nerve sink in their channels subside into languor and satiety takes possession of the mind i remember to have met with a story of a prime minister to pyrrhus who seems to have had a shrewd turn of humor when the king happened in the full rapture of expedition and his imagination dilated with ideas of future conquest to expatiate at large upon the various incidents of his growing enterprise pray sir says he what does all this tend to why cries the monarch i shall add the neighboring nations to my dominions  well and what then pray why then i shall declare war against the adjacent states  and what then sir i shall proceed in my conquests and the next province shall receive my yoke  and what then sir why their neighbors shall also pay tribute  this is very well my liege and what next  thus i shall gradually extend my victories till i become master of the globe  and what then  then  why  then i will sit down and crack a bottle with my friends  and pray sir why not do so now this passage has always appeared to me to carry with it a very fine stroke of satyr and i am inclinable to think that if the greatest hero of antiquity were to make up the account of his happiness he would find it not one jot more than is here implied  but among all the various adventurers who must feel this truth there is no set of quixotes who experience it more powerfully than the race of authors what happiness does not the periodical writer enjoy in the first dawning of a new plan  in proportion as one idea awakens a new train of pleasing images and the design opens to his view what sensations unfelt before what cheerfulness what fancy what luxuriant wit and when a sheet yet wet is sent him from the press for his inspection how his heart bounds to see himself in print  the fineness of the paper  how it pleases him the elegance of the type  how its symmetry strikes the eye the correctness of the compositor  how just and how exact  flushed with these ideas the imagination expands itself and in the fullness of selfadmiration he addresses himself in the words of hamlet  what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties  and yet pass but a few hours and how changed is every trace of reflection the critics gather round him and like the harpies in the third aeneid they break in upon his meal and like them too they denounce penury

many they have not heard of it he calls for it in coffeehouses sir we dont take it in  in places where it is used he sees it twisted into a thousand different shapes the paper and print neglected and the style unregarded the waiters throw it among the common lumber and gentlemen keep snuff in it these and many other indignities arise to mortify an authors pride and besides all this the novelty of the performance will wear off with him as well as his readers and even fame supposing the good natured world allow him his full portion will thrill by degrees with feebler impulse to his heart strings and in the conclusion i believe he will find that hero like he cannot drink his bottle with greater pleasure than when he first set out  add to this that there is a concurrence of circumstances which never sail to render the profession of an author more uneasy than any other station in life  the courtly roman satyrist has attacked with all the elegant touches of his delicate raillery that prevailing spirit of uneasiness which renders people discontented with their own situation in life and envious of the apparent felicity of their neighbors but in the lift of malcontents which he has produced i have often wondered that he has not thought proper to enrol the race that write the occasion of this might possibly be that authors have more solid reasons than any other class of beings to repine and murmur at their occupation and to wish that fate had assigned them an employment in which they might partake more of the ease and the enjoyments of life  and indeed considering the great disproportion of intenseness between the labors of the mind and those of the body i do not know whether juvenals advice to be an auctioneer rather than a poet is not entirely eligible for it is certain that those nice faculties of perception of which the literary enthusiast is possessed as they are the inlets of our most refined intellectual pleasures so they are also from the quickness and delicacy of their feeling susceptible of the most acute degrees of pain and in the same proportion that they administer to happiness they may also improve and sharpen the edge of misery in like manner as the string from which the skilful artist elicits a delightful strain of music is also capable of returning the disagreeable sounds of jarring discord  of this truth i believe every writer is convinced who is actuated by an honest ambition to acquit himself with honor in his calling for i by no means intend to speak at present of those vain scribblers who are for ever happy in their own self admiration and who are entirely strangers to the agitations of mind attendant on a genius studious of correcting and polishing his piece in fine writing there are so many intricate points which demand attention that it must be with the utmost solicit de the task is ever accomplished justness of conception and truth in every turn of wit are indispensible requisites nothing can excuse the want of delicacy of sentiment the sallies of imagination and the frolic gambols of invention must be restrained by severity of judgment and all must be expressed with perspicuty and strength of diction besides this a proper arrangement of periods following one another with graceful variety must unite the whole into harmony as the painters express themselves when they give the last finishing hand to their coloring and throw that general glow upon their piece which at the first glance strikes the intelligent spectator but the truth of it is the traces of a mind which can think with clarness and vigor upon any subject and pursue a series of ideas one emerging from another and tending gradually to form an entire whole are so seldom discovered that there is reason to think it an accomplishment unattainable without the most assiduous efforts of study and many moments of care and anxiety  an honest and fair fame is among the instigations which incite an author to undergo all this mental fatigue but even that very inducement is of so unstable a nature the acquisition of it so uncertain and the tenure so precarious that i believe what at first looked so inviting to the imagination becomes at length the writers greatest torment add to this the great hardship of pleasing that multiplicity of appetites with which mankind abound and the still greater difficulty which every man of genius experiences to please his own private taste mr pope tells us in the general preface to his works that he never wrote up to his own ideas of poetry and boileau who is second to no man for sound sense and judgment observes that an author of elevation in his conceptions is continually discontented with his performances is pleasing to all the world except himself and while his wit is every

author who begs leave this day to address his readers in his own name  i remember the introductory paper to this undertaking embarrassed my imagination more than any successive composition as coming into company is sometimes attended with uneasy flutterings which are afterward effaced by habit as i am also desirous of going off with as good a grace as possible i cannot but be a little solicitous about the manner of my exit in the social intercourse of life i know as little ceremony should be used as the nature of all things will admit but the periodical writer cannot withdraw without making his bow to the public  two different forms of writing have offered themselves to me upon this occasion the first has been practiced by several gentlemen of the quill and consists in a declamatory

disposition to gaming and many other unavailing amusements which have called off the attention of the better sort of people from all literary productions i might further expatiate in a strain of raillery on the fair and might urge that woman is very justly defined by the greek pholosopher an animal delighting in finery and that it is not in the power of the best writers of the age to attract the attention of that wandering sex who are evermore entertained with the chitchat which issues from their own pretty red lips than with a perusal of a composition calculated to retrench their follies to regulate their fancy to improve their intellectuals and to encourage them to the acquisition of those mental beauties such as sweetness of temper affability and good sense which will be always sure to confer upon them the most permanent embellishments and will prove the best wash for the complexion and an infallible preservative against the encroachments made upon the tincture of the skin by envy malice tea scandal and painful watchings at a gamingtable after this i might pompously declare that i now decline taking any further trouble with those incorrigible angels that i consign them entirely to their haircutters their dancing masters and what is still worse to their own ungoverned fantastic appetites but this form of composition is inconsistent with my present purpose as i should be glad to lay down the pen in the good graces of all my readers  the second method of address which occurred to me was that used by the excellent and humorous author of the tale of a tub after his example i have been tempted to return thanks in the most solemn manner to his majestys most honorable privy council to the lords spiritual and temporal to the honorable the house of commons to the gentlemen of the royal society to the worshipful the board of aldermen to the club at whites to the cricies at the bedford to the connosseurs at sams to the society of grubstrect and in short to all degrees and ranks of people for the just and favorable reception they have been pleased to afford to the most delectable humorous and instructive lucubrations that we have published in this our grays inn journal which has been the delight of the choice spirits of the age the terror of all offenders against decency and goodmanners and which has ascertained to the author an immortal reputation jamque opus exegi quod nec jovis ira nec ignes nec poterit serrum nec edax abolere vetustas but having considered this matter with sufficient deliberation i have judged it eligible to decline both the species of writing above exhibited the truth of it is as on the one hand i am not so selfsufficient as to arrogate to myself any extraordinary pride from the degree of success i have met with so on the other i do not think i can reasonably find any fault with the disposition of the public to the present writer i have all along steered between the two extremes of partial popular applause and a general neglect and i have therefore no colorable pretense to express the least degree of discontent at parting nor vaingloriously to exult at the applause which has been occasionally allowed to me  i am too sensible that a small portion of fame can be attributed to the productions of a young author hurried down the stream of dissipation interrupted by avocations of a thousand sorts seldom enabled to write at leisure frequently obliged to dismiss the uncorrected sheet to the press rarely happy enough to have written up even to his own taste and often checked in his career by the timidity of an adventurer who was always diffident of his own abilities and was sensible how far so young a writer must be from those strong powers of mind which when matured by age and application animate and embolden genius give authority to criticism add strength to compositions of a graver cast and inspire an author with a due degree of confidence in his decisions upon all occurrences in human life as likewise upon all topics of taste and erudition  though unattended with these advantages it is however some kind of satisfaction that i have been able to procure myself an audience once a week for two years together from perhaps several thousands in great britain and on this occasion i cannot help taking to myself a secret pleasure from the reflection that i have given a kind of weekly memorial of my existence and force sort of proof that my time has not been thrown  in a manner totally unavailing salust has a very fine sentiment which has made a very deep impression on me verum enimvero is demum mihi vivere and frui anima videtur qui aliquo negotio intentus praeclari sacinoris aut artis honae famam quaerit he may be said to live says that excellent writer and to enjoy the functions of his soul who engaged in a laudable occupation endeavors to distinguish himself by some splendid action or by the acquisition of fame in some liberal art that i have in the last way made myself conspicuous i cannot persuade myself in my most most sanguine moments but i shall always enjoy the pleasure easure of a well meant endeavor and when i look back to the commencement of this undertaking and revieiew the means by which i have kept my paper alive  will not be so prudish as to conceal a degree of selfapprobation  the plan on which i have wrote however fble the execution of it may be i am inclined to believe is not void of merit in the essay there was room for all lands of fine writing and in the news there was am room to entertain the fancy with touches of hur upon the various occurrences of human life  this scheme has not been better cultivated in all  arts must be imputed to my having wrote singly  and this consideration will i hope ren  inaccuracies more excusable  when i say that i have wrote alone i do not mean that i never received any assistance on the contrary i think it incumbent on me to acknowledge that a particular friend who must be nameless has furnished me occasionally with several humorous paragraphs of news written with a delicacy of humor peculiar to himself and i will add that i never withdrew from his conversation without some hint for the entertainment of my readers to this gentleman i am indebted for a letter from an englishman in paris no    for a scene at jonathans coffeehouse no    for an essay on i heatrical parties no    for an essay on the modern fashion of visiting no    for a second scene at jonathans no    and for the essays in    and  00 that i have not received more from him i have often thought it both a loss to the grays inn journal and the public as he possesses an elegant facility on every subject i sincerely wish that i had been able to prevail upon him against his natural indolence to afford me a great deal more of his assistance  a paper upon what may be called imitation in writing and an essay toward the fixing the standard of modern criticism together with some occasional strokes of humor in the true intelligence were the contributions of another ingenious gentleman whose friendship i am convinced would have inclined him to do something toward raising the estimation of this paper much higher had not avocations of more consequence to himself and the public demanded the exertion of his excellent abilities in another way  i must take this opportunity to thank the author of a letter occasioned by my criticism on king lear which  in the warmth of friendship and in my opition was written also in the warmth of genius an ingerious essay on physiognomy was also a present from the author of phillea the letter no    upon a  the ladies teeth is a jeu desprit by a gentleman of a very elegant and lively fancy and now and then in the news there are either articles sent by unknown hands or paragraphs raised upon their hints but of these the number is extremely small for every thing else ranger himself must stand accountable  i have now i think faithfully mentioned all the assistance i received in the course of this paper and upon this appearance of matters i believe it will be sound very short of the advantages enjoyed by some of my brother writers i have not had the happiness of being puffed in any of our common news papers or in that entertaining and truly useful work as mr griffiths calls the monthly review i have never been able to entertain the town with the writings of people of fashion nor to lay before them an essay written by a person of honor i could never boast the friendship of the nobility nor has any lord sent me a paper and upon publication bought up a thousand copies to show me how well his own performances sell i must however own that i have always exerted my utmost abilities and have put every thing out of hand with as much care as the nature of periodical productions the authors spirits and other circumstances would permit i have ever had as great a respect for the public as tully professes for a roman assembly and i agree with him when he says nihil huc nisi perfectum ingenio elaboratum industria afferri opportere at the same time i hope it will be considered what mr pope observes with great propriety that the public should not expect that an authors whole time should be spent in polishing and retouching for their pleasures  besides why may not a person rather choose an air of bold negligence than the obscure diligence of pedants and writers of affected phraseology for my part i have always thought an easy style more eligible than a pompous diction lifted up by metaphor amplisied by epithet and dignisied by too frequent insertions of the latin idiom i am therefore inclined to flatter myself that my expression has been natural and unambitious and that my arrangement has been grammatically just unperplexed and clear and that upon all occasions i have written with some degree of purity  upon the whole if i cannot boast of having produced edifying strains of morality dissertations of uncontrovertible criticism and papers of exquisite mirth and humor i hope at least the whole plan has been conducted with a strict regard to decency and without any offense against virtue or good manners to this circumstance i believe it in a great measure owing that i have been so savourably received by the town but be the cause what it may i shall always retain a grateful sense of their indulgence and in whatever way hereafter i may endeavor to entertain them i shall think they have a demand upon me for the most vigorous exertion of my abilities and let my successbe as it will i at least hope i shall have judgment enough not entirely to mistake my talents  having avowed these sentiments i shall conclude without any studied flourish of period and i remain with great respect to all my readers in particular and to the public in general  their most obliged and most obedient servant arthur murphy tavistockrow oct         finis
