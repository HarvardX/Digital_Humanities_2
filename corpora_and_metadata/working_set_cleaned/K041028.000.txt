observations on a late tate of the nation  o tite si quid ego adjuvero curamve levasso quae nunc te coquit et versat sub pectore fixa ecquid erit pretii enn ap cic london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mddclxix  price three shillings and six pence  observations on a late state of the nation party divisions whether on the whole operating for good or evil are things inseparable from free government this is a truth which i believe admits little dispute having been established by the uniform experience of all ages the part a good citizen ought to take in these divisions has been a matter of much deeper controversy but god forbid that any controversy relating to our essential morals should admit of no decision it appears to me that this question like most of the others which regard our duties in life is to be determined by our station in it private men may be wholly neutral and entirely innocent but they who are legally invested with public trust or stand on the high ground of rank and dignity which is trust implied can hardly in any case remain indifferent without the certainty of sinking into insignificance and thereby in effect deserting that post in which with the fullest authority and for the wisest purposes the laws and institutions of their country had fixed them however if it be the office of those who are thus circumstanced to take a decided part it is no less their duty that it should be a sober one it ought to be circumscribed by the same laws of decorum and balanced by the same temper which bound and regulate all the virtues in a word we ought to act in party with all the moderation which does not absolutely enervate that vigor and quench that fervency of spirit without which the best wishes for the public good must evaporate in empty speculation  it is probably from some such motives that the friends of a very respectable party in this kingdom have been hitherto silent for these two years past from one and the same quarter of politics a continual fire has been kept upon them sometimes from the unweildy column of quartos and octavos sometimes from the light squadrons of occasional pamphlets and flying sheets every month has brought on its periodical calumny the abuse has taken every shape which the ability of the writers could give it plain invective clumsy raillery misrepresented anecdote history of the minority history of the repeal of the stamp act considerations on trade and finances political register etc etc no method of vilifying the measures the abilities the intentions or the persons which compose that body has been omitted  on their part nothing was opposed but patience and character it was a matter of the most serious and indignant affliction to persons who thought themselves in conscience bound to oppose a ministry dangerous from its very constitution as well as its measures to find themselves whenever they faced their adversaries continually attacked on the rear by a set of men who pretended to be actuated by motives similar to theirs they saw that the plan long pursued with but too fatal a success was to break the strength of this kingdom by frittering down the bodies which compose it by fomenting bitter and sanguinary animosities and by dissolving every tie of social affection and public trust these virtuous men such i am warranted by public opinion to call them were resolved rather to endure every thing than cooperate in that design a diversity of opinion upon almost every principle of politics had indeed drawn a strong line of separation between them and some others however they were desirous not to extend the misfortune by unnecessary bitterness they wished to prevent a difference of opinion on the commonwealth from festering into rancorous and incurable hostility accordingly they endeavored that all past controversies should be forgotten and that enough for the day should be the evil thereof there is however a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue men may tolerate injuries whilst they are only personal to themselves but it is not the first of virtues to bear with moderation the indignities that are offered to our country a piece has at length appeared from the quarter of all the former attacks which upon every public consideration demands an answer whilst persons more equal to this business may be engaged in affairs of greater moment i hope i shall be excused if in a few hours of a time not very important and from such materials as i have by me more than enough however for this purpose i undertake to set the facts and arguments of this wonderful performance in a proper light i will endeavor to state what this piece is the purpose for which i take it to have been written and the effects supposing it should have any effect at all it must necessarily produce  this piece is called the present state of the nation it may be considered as a sort of digest of the avowed maxims of a certain political school the effects of whose doctrines and practices this country will feel long and severely it is made up of a farrago of almost every topic which has been agitated in parliamentary debate or private conversation on national affairs for these seven last years the oldest controversies are hawled out of the dust with which time and neglect had covered them arguments ten times repeated a thousand times answered before are here repeated again public accounts formerly printed and reprinted revolve once more and find their old station in this sober meridian all the commonplace lamentations upon the decay of trade the increase of taxes and the high price of labor and provisions are here retailed again and again in the same tone with which they have drawled through columns of gazetteers and advertisers for a century together paradoxes which affront common sense and uninteresting barren truths which generate no conclusion are thrown in to augment unweildy bulk without adding any thing to weight because two accusations are better than one contradictions are set staring one another in the face without even an attempt to reconcile them and to give the whole a sort of portentous air of labor and information the table of the house of commons is swept into this grand reservoir of politics  as to the composition it bears a striking and whimsical resemblance to a funeral sermon not only in the pathetic prayer with which it concludes but in the style and tenor of the whole performance it is piteously doleful nodding every now and then toward dullness well stored with pious frauds and like most discourses of the sort much better calculated for the private advantage of the preacher than the edification of the hearers  the author has indeed so involved his subject that it is frequently far from being easy to comprehend his meaning it is happy for the public that it is never difficult to fathom his design the apparent intention of this author is to draw the most aggravated hideous and deformed picture of the state of this country which his querulous eloquence aided by the arbitrary dominion he assumes over fact is capable of exhibiting had he attributed our misfortunes to their true cause the injudicious tampering of bold improvident and visionary ministers at one period or to their supine negligence and traitorous dissentions at another the complaint had been just and might have been useful but far the greater and much the worst part of the state which he exhibits is owing according to his representation not to accidental and extrinsic mischiefs attendant on the nation but to its radical weakness and constitutional distempers all this however is not without purpose the author is in hopes that when we are fallen into a fanatical terror for the national salvation we shall then be ready to throw ourselves in a sort of precipitate trust some strange disposition of the mind jumbled up of presumption and despair into the hands of the most pretending and forward undertaker one such undertaker at least he has in readiness for our service but let me assure this generous person that however he may succeed in exciting our fears for the public danger he will find it hard indeed to engage us to place any confidence in the system he proposes for its security  his undertaking is great the purpose of this pamphlet and at which it aims directly or obliquely in every page is to persuade the public of three or four of the most difficult points in the world  that all the advantages of the late war were on the part of the bourbon alliance that the peace of paris perfectly consulted the dignity and interest of this country and that the american stamp act was a master piece of policy and finance that the only good minister this nation has enjoyed since his majestys accession is the earl of bute and the only good managers of revenue we have seen are lord despenser and mr george grenville and under the description of men of virtue and ability he holds them out to us as the only persons fit to put our affairs in order let not the reader mistake me he does not actually name these persons but having highly applauded their conduct in all its parts and heavily censured every other set of men in the kingdom he then recommends us to his men of virtue and ability  such is the authors scheme whether it will answer his purpose i know not but surely that purpose ought to be a wonderfully good one to warrant the methods he has taken to compass it if the facts and reasonings in this piece are admitted it is all over with us the continuance of our tranquillity depends upon the compassion of our rivals unable to secure to ourselves the advantages of peace we are at the same time utterly unfit for war it is impossible if this state of things be credited abroad that we can have any alliance all nations will sly from so dangerous a connection lest instead of being partakers of our strength they should only become sharers in our ruin if it is believed at home all that firmness of mind and dignified national courage which used to be the great support of this isle against the powers of the world must melt away and fail within us  in such a state of things can it be amiss if i aim at holding out some comfort to the nation another sort of comfort indeed than that which this writer provides for it a comfort not from its physician but from its constitution if i attempt to show that all the arguments upon which he founds the decay of that constitution and the necessity of that physician are vain and frivolous i will follow the author closely in his own long career through the war the peace the finances our trade and our foreign politics not for the sake of the particular measures which he discusses that can be of no use they are all decided their good is all enjoyed or their evil incurred but for the sake of the principles of war peace trade and finances these principles are of infinite moment they must come again and again under consideration and it imports the public of all things that those of its minister be enlarged and just and well confirmed upon all these subjects what notions this author entertains we shall see presently notions in my opinion very irrational and extremely dangerous and which if they should crawl from pamphlets into counsels and be realized from private speculation into national measures cannot fail of hastening and completing our ruin  this author after having paid his compliment to the shewy appearances of the late war in our favor is in the utmost haste to tell you that these appearances were fallacious that they were no more than an imposition  i fear i must trouble the reader with a pretty long quotation in order to set before him the more clearly this authors peculiar way of conceiving and reasoning  happily the k was then advised by ministers who did not suffer themselves to be dazzled by the glare of brilliant appearances but knowing them to be fallacious they wisely resolved to profit of their splendor before our enemies should also discover the imposition  the increase in the exports was found to have been occasioned chiefly by the demands of our own fleets and armies and instead of bringing wealth to the nation were to be paid for by oppressive taxes upon the people of england while the british seamen were consuming on board our men of war and privateers soreign ships and foreign seamen were employed in the transportation of our merchandise and the carrying trade so great a source of wealth and marine was entirely engrossed by the neutral nations the number of british ships annually arriving in our ports was reduced to      sail containing       tons on a medium of the six years war compared with the six years of peace preceding it  the conquest of the havannah bad indeed stopped the remittance of specie from mexico to spain but it had not enabled england to seize it on the contrary our merchants suffered by the detention of the galleons as their correspondents in spain were disabled from paying them for their goods sent to america the loss of the trade to old spain was a farther bar to an influx of specie and the attempt upon portugal had not only deprived us of an import of bullion from thence but the payment of our troops employed in its defense was a fresh drain opened for the diminution of our circulating specie  the high premiums given for new loans had sunk the price of the old stock near a third of its original value so that the purchasers had an obligation from the state to repay them with an addition of    per cent to their capital every new loan required new taxes to be imposed new taxes must add to the price of our manufactures and lessen their consumption among foreigners the decay of our trade must necessarily occasion a decrease of the public revenue and a deficiency of our funds must either be made up by fresh taxes which would only add to the calamity or our national credit must be destroyed by showing the public creditors the inability of the nation to repay them their principal money  bounties had already been given for recruits which exceeded the years wages of the plowman and reaper and as these were exhausted and husbandry stood still for want of hands the manufacturers were next to be tempted to quit the anvil and the loom by higher offers  france bankrupt france had no such calamities impending over her her distresses were great but they were immediate and temporary her want of credit preserved her from a great increase of debt and the loss of her ultramarine dominions lessened her expenses her colonies had indeed put themselves into the hands of the english but the property of her subjects had been preserved by capitulations and a way opened for making her those remittances which the war had before suspended with as much security as in time of peace  her armies in germany had been hitherto prevented from seizing upon hanover but they continued to encamp on the same ground on which the first battle was fought and as it must ever happen from the policy of that government the last troops she sent into the field were always found to be the best and her frequent losses only served to fill her regiments with better soldiers the conquest of hanover became therefore every campaign more probable it is to be noted that the french troops received subsistence only for the last three years of the war and that although large arrears were due to them at its conclusion the charge was the less during its continuance p          0   if any one be willing to see to how much greater lengths the author carries these ideas he will recur to the book this is sufficient for a specimen of his manner of thinking i believe one reflection uniformly obtrudes itself upon every reader of these paragraphs for what purpose in any cause shall we hereafter contend with france can we ever flatter ourselves that we shall wage a more successful war if on our part in a war the most prosperous we ever carried on by sea and by land and in every part of the globe attended with the unparalleled circumstance of an immense increase of trade and augmentation of revenue if a continued series of disappointments disgraces and defeats followed by public bankruptcy on the part of france if all these still leave her a gainer on the whole balance will it not be downright phrenzy in us ever to look her in the face again or to contend with her any even the most essential points since victory and defeat though by different ways equally conduct us to our ruin subjection to france without a struggle will indeed be less for our honor but on every principle of our author it must be more for our advantage according to his representation of things the question is only concerning the most easy fall france had not discovered our statesman tells us at the end of that war the triumphs of defeat and the resources which are derived from bankruptcy for my poor part i do not altogether wonder at their blindness but the english ministers saw further our author has at length let foreigners also into the secret and made them altogether as wise as ourselves it is their own fault if vulgato imperii arcano they are imposed upon any longer they now are apprized of the sentiments which the great candidate for the government of this great empire entertains and they will act accordingly they are taught our weakness and their own advantages  he tells the world that if france carries on the war against us in germany every loss she sustains contributes to the achievement of her per damna per cedes ab ipso ducit opes animumque ferro if so what is it we can do to hurt her  it will be all an imposition all fallacious why the result must be  occidit occidit spes omnis and fortuna nostri nominis  the only way which the authors principles leave for our escape is to reverse our condition into that of france and to take her losing cards into our hands but though his principles drive him to it his politics will not suffer him to walk on this ground talking at our ease and of other countries we may bear to be diverted with such speculations but in england we shall never be taught to look upon the annihilation of our trade the ruin of our credit the defeat of our armies and the loss of our ultramarine dominions whatever the author may think of them to be the high road to prosperity and greatness  the reader does not i hope imagine that i mean seriously to set about the refutation of these uningenious paradoxes and reveries without imagination i state them only that we may discern a little in the questions of war and peace the most weighty of all questions what is the wisdom of those men who are held out to us as the only hope of an expiring nation the present ministry is indeed of a strange character at once indolent and distracted but if a ministerial system should be formed actuated by such maxims as are avowed in this piece the vices of the present ministry would become their virtues their indolence would be the greatest of all public benefits and a distraction that entirely defeated every one of their schemes would be our only security from destruction  to have stated these reasonings is enough i presume to do their business but they are accompanied with facts and records which may seem of a little more weight i trust however that the facts of this author will be as far from bearing the touchstone as his arguments on a little inquiry they will be found as great an imposition as the successes they are meant to depreciate for they are all either false or fallaciously applied or not in the least to the purpose for which they are produced  first the author in order to support his favorite paradox that our possession of the french colonies was of no detriment to france has thought proper to inform us that they put themselves into the hands of the english he uses the same assertion in nearly the same words carried on of sir charles saunders whose steadiness and presence of mind saved our fleet and were so eminently serviceable in the whole course of the siege of quebec of general monkton who was shot through the body there whether france put her colonies into the hands of the english  though he has made no exception yet i would be liberal to him perhaps he means to confine himself to her colonies in the west indies but surely it will fare as ill with him there as in north america whilst we remember that in our first attempt on martinico we were actually defeated that it was three months before we reduced guadaloupe and that the conquest of the havannah was achieved by the highest conduct aided by circumstances of the greatest good fortune he knows the expense both of men and treasure at which we bought that place however if it had so pleased the peacemakers it was no dear purchase for it was decisive of the fortune of the war and the terms of the treaty the duke of nivernois thought so france england europe considered it in that light all the world except the then friends of the then ministry who wept for our victories and were in haste to get rid of the burden of our conquests this author knows that france did not put those colonies into the hands of england but he well knows who did put the most valuable of them into the hands of france  in the next place our author is pleased to consider the conquest of these colonies in no other light than as a convenience for the remittances to  in      there was no entry of goods from any of the conquered places but guadaloupe in that year it stood thus l imports from guadaloupe value        in      when we had not yet delivered up our conquests the account was guadaloupe        martinico        total imports l  0     in      after we had delivered up the sovereignty of these islands but kept open a communication with them the imports were l guadaloupe     0  martinico        havannah        total imports in      value l  00   0 besides i find in the account of bullion imported and brought to the bank that during the period in which the intercourse with the havannah was open we received at that one shop in treasure from that one place l      0 in the year      l      0 so that the import from these places in that year amounted to l      00  on this state the reader will observe that i take the imports from and not the exports to these conquests as the measure of the advantages which we derived from them i do so for reasons which will be somewhat worthy the attention of such readers as are fond of this species of inquiry i say therefore i choose the import article as the best and indeed the only standard we can have of the value of the west india trade our export entry does not comprehend the greatest trade we carry on with any of the west india islands the sale of negroes nor does it give any idea of two other advantages we draw from them the remittances for money spent here and the payment of part of the balance of the north american trade it is therefore quite ridiculous to strike a balance merely on the face of an excess of imports and exports in that commerce though in most foreign branches it is on the whole the best method if we should take that standard it would appear that the balance with our own islands is annually several hundred thousand pounds against this country l total imports from the west indies in        0     exports to ditto in ditto        excess of imports l  0   00 in this which is the common way of stating the balance it will appear upwards of two millions against us which is ridiculous    such is its aspect on the customhouse entries but we know the direct contrary to be the fact we know that the west indians are always indebted to our merchants and that the value of every shilling of west india produce is english property so that our import from them and not our export ought always to be considered as their true value and this corrective ought to be applied to all general balances of our trade which are formed on the ordinary principles  if possible this was more emphatically true of the french west india islands whilst they continued in our hands that none or only a very contemptible part of the value of this produce could be remitted to france the author will see perhaps with unwillingness but with the clearest conviction if he considers that in the year      after we had ceased to export to the isles of guadaloupe and martinico and to the havannah and after the colonies were free to send all their produce to old france and spain if they had any remittance to make he will see that we imported from these places in that year to the amount of l      00 so far was the whole annual produce of these islands from being adequate to the payments of their annual call upon us that this mighty additional importation was necessary though not quite sufficient to discharge the debts contracted in the few years we held them the property therefore of their whole produce was ours not only during the war but even for more than a year after the peace the author i hope will not again venture upon so rash and discouraging a proposition concerning the nature and effect of these conquests as to call them a convenience to the remittances of france he sees by this account that what he asserts is not only without foundation but even impossible to be true  as to our trade at that time he labors with all his might to represent it as absolutely ruined or on the very edge of ruin indeed as usual with him he is often as equivocal in his expression as he is clear in his design sometimes he more than insinuates a decay of our commerce in that war sometimes he admits an increase of exports but it is in order to depreciate the advantages we might appear to derive from that increase whenever it should come to be proved against him he tells you that it was chiefly occasioned by the demands of our own fleets and armies and instead of bringing wealth to the nation were to be paid for by oppressive taxes upon the people of england never was any thing more destitute of foundation it might be proved with the greatest ease from the nature and quality of the goods exported as well as from the situation of the places to which our merchandise was sent and which the war could no ways affect that the supply of our fleets and armies could not have been the cause of this wonderful increase of trade its cause was evident to the whole world the ruin of the trade of france and our possession of her colonies what wonderful effects this cause produced the reader will see below           l s d l s d total export of british goods value      0        0            ditto of foreign goods in time

          0 l             here is the state of our trade in      compared with a very good year of profound peace both are taken from the authentic entries of the customhouse how the author can contrive to make this increase of the export of english produce agree with his account of the dreadful want of hands in england p   unless he supposes manufactures to be made without hands i really do not see it is painful to be so frequently obliged to set this author right in matters of fact this state will fully refute all that he has said or insinuated upon the difficulties and decay of our trade p     and    and he will form on that account some judgment of the authors candor or information  admit however that a great part of our export which is the remotest in the world from fact was owing to our supply of our fleets and armies was it not something  was it not peculiarly fortunate for a nation that she was able from her own bosom to contribute largely to the supply of her armies militating in so many distant countries the author allows that france did not enjoy the same advantages but it is remarkable throughout his whole book that those circumstances which have ever been considered as great benefits and decisive proofs of national superiority are when in our hands taken either in diminution of some other apparent advantage or even sometimes as positive misfortunes the optics of that politician must be of a strange conformation who beholds every thing in this distorted light  so far as to our trade with regard to our navigation he is still more uneasy at our situation and still more fallacious in his state of it in his text he affirms it to have been entirely engrossed by the neutral nations p   see also p     this he asserts roundly and boldly and without the least concern although it cost no more than a single glance of the eye upon his own margin to see the full refutation of this assertion his own account proves against him that in the year      the british shipping amounted to        tons  the foreign to no more than   0 0  the medium of his six years british         tons  foreign only  0   0 this state his own demonstrates that the neutral nations did not entirely engross our navigation  i am willing from a strain of candor to admit that this author speaks at random that he is only slovenly and inaccurate and not fallacious in matters of account however this want of care is not excusable and the difference between neutral nations entirely engrossing our navigation and being only subsidiary to a vastly augmented trade makes a most material difference to his argument from that principle of fairness though the author speaks otherwise i am willing to suppose he means no more than that our navigation had so declined as to alarm us with the probable loss of this valuable object i shall however show that his whole proposition whatever modifications he may please to give it is without foundation that our navigation was not decreased that on the contrary it was greatly increased in the war that it was increased by the war and that it was probable the same cause would continue to augment it to a still greater height to what an height it is hard to say had our success continued  but first i must observe i am much less solicitous whether his fact be true or no than whether his principle is well established cases are dead things principles are living and productive i then affirm that if in time of war our trade had the good fortune to increase and at the same time a large nay the largest proportion of carriage had been engrossed by neutral nations it ought not in itself to have been considered as a circumstance of distress war is a time of inconvenience to trade in general it must be straitened and must find its way as it can it is often happy for nations that they are able to call in neutral navigation they all aim at it france endeavored at it but could not compass it will this author say that in a war with spain such a convenience would not be of absolute necessity that it would not be the most gross of all follies to refuse it  in the next place his method of stating a medium of six years of war and six years of peace to decide this question is altogether unfair to say in derogation of the advantages of a war that navigation is not equal to what it was in time of peace is what hitherto has never been heard of no war ever bore that test but the war which he so bitterly laments one may lay it down as a maxim that an average estimate of an object in a steady course of rising or of falling must in its nature be an unfair one more particularly if the cause of the rise or fall be visible and its continuance in any degree probable average estimates are never just but when the object fluctuates and no reason can be assigned why it should not continue still to fluctuate the author chooses to allow nothing at all for this he has taken an average of six years of the war he knew for every body knows that the first three years were on the whole rather unsuccessful and that in consequence of this ill success trade sunk and navigation declined with it but that grand delusion of the three last years turned the scale in our favor at the beginning of that war as in the commencement of every war traders were struck with a sort of panick many went out of the freighting business but by degrees as the war continued the terror wore off the danger came to be better appreciated and better provided against our trade was carried on in large fleets under regular conduct and with great safety the freighting business revived the ships were fewer but much larger and though the number decreased the tonnage was vastly augmented insomuch that in      the british shipping had risen by the authors own account to        tons  in the last year he has given us of the peace it amounted to no more than        that is in the last year of the war it was       tons more than in the correspondent year of his peace average no year of the peace exceeded it except one and that but little  the fair account of the matter is this our trade had as we have just seen increased to so astonishing a degree in      as to employ british and foreign ships to the amount of  0     tons which is     00 more than we employed in the last year of the peace  thus our trade increased nearly a fifth our british navigation had increased likewise with this astonishing increase of trade but was not able to keep pace with it and we added about  0000 ton more of foreign shipping than had been employed in the last year of peace  whatever happened to our shipping in the former years of the war this would be no true state of the case at the time of the treaty if we had lost something in the beginning we had then recovered and more than recovered all our losses here is the subject of the doleful complaints of the author that the carrying trade was wholly engrossed by the neutral nations  i have done fairly and even very moderately in taking this year and not his average as the standard of what might be expected in future had the war continued the author will be compelled to allow it unless he undertakes to show first that the possession of canada martinico guadaloupe granada the havannah the philippines the whole african trade the whole east india trade and the whole newfoundland fishery had no certain inevitable tendency to increase the british shipping unless in the second place he can prove that those trades were or might by law or indulgence be carried on in foreign vessels and unless thirdly he can demonstate that the premium of insurance on british ships was rising as the war continued he can prove not one of these points i will show him a fact more that is mortal to his assertions it is the state of our shipping in      the author had his reasons for stopping short at the preceding year it would have appeared had he proceeded farther that our tonnage was in a course of uniform augmentation owing to the freights derived from our foreign conquests and to the perfect security of our navigation from our clear and decided superiority at sea this i say would have appeared from the state of the two years      british        tons      do        tons foreign   0 0  tons do     0  tons the two best years of the peace were in no degree equal to these much of the navigation of      was also owing to the war this is manifest from the large part of it employed in the carriage from the ceded islands with which the communication still continued open no such circumstances of glory and advantage ever attended upon a war too happy will be our lot if we should again be forced into a war to behold any thing that shall resemble them and if we were not then the better for them it is not in the ordinary course of gods providence to mend our condition  in vain does the author declaim on the high premiums given for the loans during that war his long note swelled with calculations even supposing the most inaccurate of all calculations to be just on that  thus the author has laid down his ideas on the subject of war next follow those he entertains on that of peace the treaty of paris upon the whole has his approbation indeed if his account of the war be just he might have spared himself all further trouble the rest is drawn on as an inevitable conclusion if the house of bourbon had the advantage deluded on the state of that war other arguments are necessary and the author has in my opinion very ill supplied them he tells of many things we have got and of which he has made out a kind of bill this matter may be brought within a very narrow compass if we come to consider the requisites of a good peace under some plain distinct heads i apprehend they may be reduced to these   stability   indemnification   alliance  as to the first the author more than obscurely hints in several places that he thinks the peace not likely to last however he does furnish a security a security in any light i fear but insufficient on his hypothesis surely a very odd one by stipulating for the entire possession of the this author soon grows weary of his principles they seldom last him for two pages together when the advantages of the war were to be depreciated then the loss of the ultramarine colonies lightened the expenses of france facilitated her remittances and therefore her colonists put them into our hands according to this authors system the actual possession of those colonies ought to give us little or no advantage in the negotiation for peace and yet the chance of possessing them on a future occasion gives a perfect security for the preservation of that peace the conquest of the havannah if it did not serve spain rather distressed england says our author our merchants suffered by the detention of the gallcons as their correspondents in spain were disabled from paying them for their goods sent to america state of the nation p       the author sets very little by conquests i suppose it is because he that the most successful enterprise a position which he repeats again p   so that according to himself his security is not worth the suit according to fact he has only a chance god knows what a chance of getting at it and therefore according to reason the giving up the most valuable of all possessions in hopes to conquer them back under any advantage of situation is the most ridiculous security that ever was imagined for the peace of a nation it is true his friends did not give up canada they could not give up every thing let us make the most of it we have canada we know its value we have not the french any longer to fight in north america and from this circumstance we derive considerable advantages but here let me rest a little the author touches upon a string which sounds under his fingers but a tremulous and melancholy note  north america was once indeed a great strength to this nation in opportunity of ports in ships in provisions in men we sound her a sound an active a vigorous member of the empire i hope by wise management she will again become so but one of our capital present misfortunes is her discontent and disobedience to which of the authors favorites this discontent is owing we all know but too sufficiently  it would be a dismal event if this foundation of his security and indeed of all our public strength should in reality become our weakness and if all the powers of this empire which ought to fall with a compacted weight upon the head of our enemies should be dissipated and distracted by a jealous vigilance or by hostile attempts upon one another ten canadas cannot restore that security for the peace and for every thing valuable to this country which we have lost along with the affection and the obedience of our colonies he is the wise minister he is the true friend to britain who shall be able to restore it  to return to the security for the peace the author tells us that family compact had been i know not how long before in agitation but then it was that we saw produced into daylight and action the most odious and most formidable of all the conspiracies against the liberties of europe that ever has been framed the war with spain was the first fruits of that league and a security against that league ought to have been the fundamental point of a pacification with the powers who compose it we had materials in our hands to have constructed that security in such a manner as never to be shaken but how did the virtuous and able men of our author labor for this great end they took no one step toward it on the contrary they countenanced and indeed as far as it depended on them recognized it in all its parts for our plenipotentiary treated with those who acted for the two crowns as if they had been different ministers of the same monarch the spanish minister received his instructions not from madrid but from versailles  this was not hid from our ministers at home and the discovery ought to have alarmed them if the good of their country had been the object of their anxiety they could not but have seen that the whole spanish monarchy was melted down into the cabinet of versailles but they thought this circumstance an advantage as it enabled them to go through with their work the more expeditiously expedition was every thing to them because france might happen during a protracted negotiation to discover the great imposition of our victories  in the same spirit they negotiated the terms of the peace if it were thought advisable not to take any positive security from spain the most obvious principles of policy dictated that the burden of the cessions ought to fall upon france and that every thing which was of grace and favor should be given to spain spain could not on her part have executed a capital article in the family compact which obliged her to compensate the losses of france at least she could not do it in america for she was expressly precluded by the treaty of utrecht from ceding any territory or giving any advantage in trade to that power what did our ministers they took from spain the territory of florida an object of no value except to show our dispositions to be quite equal at least toward both powers and they enabled france to compensate spain by the gift of louisiana loading us with all the harshness leaving the act of kindness with france and opening thereby a door to the fulfilling of this the most consolidating article of the family compact accordingly that dangerous league thus abetted and authorized by the english ministry without an attempt to invalidate it in any way or in any of its parts exists to this hour and has grown stronger and stronger every hour of its existence  as to the second component of a good peace compensation i have but little trouble the author has said nothing upon that head he has nothing to say after a war of such expense this ought to have been a capital consideration but on what he has been so prudently silent i think it is right to speak plainly all our new acquisitions together at this time scarce afford matter of revenue either at home or abroad sufficient to defray the expense of their establishments not one shilling toward the reduction of our debt guadaloupe or martinico alone would have given us material aid much in the way of duties much in the way of trade and navigation a good ministry would have considered how a renewal of the assiento might have been obtained we had as much right to ask it at the treaty of paris as at the treaty of utrecht we had incomparably more in our hands to purchase it floods of treasure would have poured into this kingdom from such a source and under proper management no small part of it would have taken a public direction and have fructified an exhausted exchequer  if this gentlemans hero of finance instead of flying from a treaty which though he now defends he could not approve and would not oppose if he instead of shifting into an office which removed him from the manufacture of the treaty had by his credit with the then great director acquired for us these or any of these objects the possession of guadaloupe or martinique or of the renewal of the assiento he might have held his head high in his country because he would have performed real service ten thousand times more real service than all the economy of which this writer is perpetually talking or all the little tricks of finance which the expertest juggler of the treasury can practice could amount to in a thousand years but the occasion is lost the time is gone perhaps for ever  as to the third requisite alliance there too the author is silent what strength of that kind did they acquire they got no one new ally they stripped the enemy of not a single old one they disgusted how justly or unjustly matters not every ally we had and from that time to this we stand friendless in europe but of this naked condition of their country i know some people are not ashamed they have their system of politics our ancestors grew great by another in this manner these virtuous men concluded the peace and their practice is only consonant to their theory  many things more might be observed on this curious head of our authors speculations but taking leave of what the writer says in his serious part if he be serious in any part i shall only just point out a piece of his pleasantry no man i believe ever denied that the time for making peace is that in which the best terms may be obtained but what that time is together with the use that has been made of it we are to judge by seeing whether terms adequate to our advantages and to our necessities have been actually obtained  here is the pinch of the question and to which the author ought to have set his shoulders in earnest instead of doing this he slips out of the harness by a jest and sneeringly tells us that to determine this point we must know the secrets of the french and spanish cabinets something however has transpired in the quarrels among those concerned in that transaction it seems the good genius of britain so much vaunted by our author did his duty nobly whilst we were gaining such advantages the court of france was astonished at our concessions jai apporte a versailles il est vrai les ratifications du roi dangleterre a vostre grand etonnement et a celui de bien dautres je dois cela an bontes du roi dangleterre a celles de milord bute a mons le comte de viry a mons le due de nivernois et a sin a mon savoir fair letters etc du chev deon p     and that parliament was pleased to approve the treaty of peace without calling for the correspondence concerning it how just this sarcasm on that parliament may be i say not but how becoming in the author i leave it to his friends to determine  having thus gone through the questions of war and peace the author proceeds to state our debt and the interest which it carried at the time of the treaty with the unfairness and inaccuracy however which distinguish all his assertions and all his calculations to detect every fallacy and rectify every mistake would be endless it will be enough to point out a few of them in order to show how unsafe it is to place any thing like an implicit trust in such a writer  the interest of debt contracted during the war is stated by the author at l           the particulars appear in pages    and    among them is stated the unfunded debt l       0   supposed to carry interest on a medium at   per cent which amounts to l       0 we are referred to the considerations on the trade and finances of the kingdom p    for the particulars of that unfunded debt turn to the work and to the place referred to by the author himself if you have a mind to see a clear detection of a capital fallacy of this article in his account you will there see that this unfunded debt consists of the nine following articles the remaining subsidy to the duke of brunswick the remaining dedommagement to the landgrave of hesse the german demands the army and ordnance extraordinaries the deficiencies of grants and funds mr touchits claim the debts due to nova scotia and barbados exchequer bills and navy debt the extreme fallacy of this state cannot escape any reader who will be at the pains to compare the interest money with which he affirms us to have been loaded in his state of the nation with the items of the principal debt to which he refers in his considerations the reader must observe that of this long list of nine articles only two the exchequer bills and part of the navy debt carried any interest at all the first amounted to l    00 000 and this undoubtedly carried interest the whole navy debt indeed amounted to l           but of this only a part carried interest the author of the considerations etc labors to prove this very point in p    and mr g has always defended himself upon the same ground for the insufficient provision he made for the discharge of that debt the reader may see their own authority for it the navy bills are not due till six months after they have been issued six months also of the seamens wages by act of parliament must be and in consequence of the rules prescribed by that act twelve months wages generally and often much more are retained and there has been besides at all times a large arrear of pay which though kept in the account could never be claimed the persons to whom it was due having left neither assignees nor representatives the precise amount of such sums cannot be ascertained but they can hardly be reckoned less than    or    hundred thousand pounds on   st dec      when the navy debt was reduced nearly as low as it could be it still amounted to           l    s    d consisting chiefly of articles which could not then be discharged such articles will be larger now in proportion to the increase of the establishment and an allowance must always be made for them in judging of the state of the navy debt though they are not distinguishable in the account in providing for that which is payable the principal object of the legislature is always to discharge the bills for they are the greatest article they bear an interest of   per cent and when the quantity of them is large they are a heavy encumbrance upon all money transactions     mr g did in fact provide no more than l     0 000 for the discharge of these bills in two years it is much to be wished that these gentlemen would lay their heads together that they would consider well this matter and agree upon something for when the scanty provision made for the unfunded debt is to be vindicated then we are told it is a very small part of that debt which carries interest but when the public state is to be represented in a miserable condition and the consequences of the late war to be laid before us in dreadful colors then we are to be told that the unfunded debt is within a trifle of ten millions and so large a portion of it carries interest that we must not compute less than   per cent upon the whole  in the year      parliament voted l   0 000 toward the discharge of the navy debt this sum could not be applied solely to the discharge of bills carrying interest because part of the debt due on seamens wages must have been paid and some bills carried no interest at all notwithstanding this we find by an account in the journals of the h of c in the following session that the navy debt carrying interest was on the   st of december      no more than l         i am sure therefore that i admit too much when i admit the navy debt carrying interest after the creation of the navy annuities in the year      to have been l   00000 add the exchequer bills and the whole unfunded debt carrying interest will be four millions instead of ten and the annual interest paid for it at   per cent will be l   0000 instead of l      0 an error of no small magnitude and which could not have been owing to inadvertency  the misrepresentation of the increase of the peace establishment is still more extraordinary than that of the interest on the unfunded debt the increase is great undoubtedly however the author finds no fault with it and urges it only as a matter of argument to support the strange chimerical proposals he is to make us in the close of his work for the increase of revenue the greater he made that establishment the stronger he expected to stand in argument but whatever he expected or proposed he should have stated the matter fairly he tells us that this establishment is near l   00000 more than it was in           and other years of peace this he has done in his usual manner by assertion without troubling himself either with proof or probability for he has not given us any state of the peace establishment in the years      and      the time which he means to compare with the present as i am obliged to force him to that precision from which he always flies as from his most dangerous enemy i have been at the trouble to search the journals in the period between the two last wars and i find that the peace establishment consisting of the navy the ordnance and the several incidental expenses amounted to l         now is this writer wild enough to imagine that the peace establishment of      and the subsequent years made up from the same articles is l   00000 and upwards his assertion however goes to this but i must take the liberty of correcting him in this gross mistake and from an authority he cannot refuse from his favorite work and standing authority the considerations we find there in p    l navy    0 00 army      00 ordnance     00 the four american governments    00 general surveys in america   00 foundling hospital   000 to the african committee   000 for the civil establishment on the coast of africa   00 militia  00000 deficiency of land and malt  00000 deficiency of funds  0  00 extraordinaries of the army and navy   000 total l   0  00  the peace establishment of      and      stated at l   0  00 this is near two hundred thousand pounds less than that given in the state of the nation but even from this in order to render the articles which compose the peace establishment in the two periods correspondent for otherwise they cannot be compared we must deduct first his articles of the deficiency of land and malt which amount to l  00000 they certainly are no part of the establishment nor are they included in that sum which i have stated above for the establishment in the time of the former peace if they were proper to be stated at all they ought to be stated in both accounts we must also deduct the deficiencies of funds l  0  00 these deficiencies are the difference between the interest charged on the public for moneys borrowed and the produce of the taxes laid for the discharge of that interest annual provision is indeed to be made for them by parliament but in the enquiry before us which is only what charge is brought on the public by interest paid or to be paid for money borrowed the utmost that the author should do is to bring into the account the full interest for all that money this he has done in p    and he repeats it in p    the very page i am now examining l         to comprehend afterward in the peace establishment the deficiency of the fund created for payment of that interest would be laying twice to the account of the war part of the same sum suppose ten millions borrowed at   per cent and the fund for payment of the interest to produce no more than l  00000 the whole annual charge on the public is l  00000 it can be no more but to charge the interest in one part of the account and then the deficiency in the other would be charging l  00000 the deficiency of funds must therefore be also deducted from the peace establishment in the considerations and then the peace establishment in that author will be reduced to the same articles with those included in the sum i have already mentioned for the peace establishment before the last war in the year      and       l peace establishment in the considerations   0  00 deduct deficiency of land and malt  00000 do of funds  0  00  0  00   0  00 peace establishment before the late war in which no deficiencies of land and malt or funds are included         difference l   0 0   being about half the sum which our author has been pleased to suppose it  let us put the whole together the author states l difference of peace establishment before and since the war   00000 interest of debt contracted by the war                 the real difference in the peace establishment is   0 0  the actual interest of the funded debt including that charged on the sinking fund is         the actual interest of unfunded debt at most   0000 total interest of debt contracted by the war         increase of peace establishment and interest of the new debt         error of the author l         it is true the extraordinaries of the army have been found considerably greater than the author of the considerations was pleased to foretell they would be the author of the present state avails himself of that increase and finding it suit his purpose sets the whole down in the peaceestablishment of the present times if this is allowed him his error perhaps may be reduced to l  00000 but i doubt the author of the considerations will not thank him for admitting l  00000 and upwards as the peaceestablishment for extraordinaries when that author has so much labored to confine them within l   000  these are some of the capital fallacies of the author to break the thread of my discourse as little as possible i have thrown into the margin many instances though god knows far from the whole of his inaccuracies inconsistencies and want of common care i think myself obliged to take some notice of them in order to take off from any authority this writer may have and to put an end to the deference which careless men are apt to pay to one who boldly arrays his accounts and marshals his figures in perfect confidence that their correctness will never be examined upon the money borrowed in    0 the premium of   per cent was for    years not for  0 this annuity has been paid   years instead of   the sum paid is therefore l   0000 instead of l   0000 the remaining term is worth  0 years and a quarter instead of    years its value is l   0000 instead of l   0000 and the whole value of that premium is l    0000 instead of    0000 the like errors are observable in his computation on the additional capital of   per cent on the loan of that year in like manner on the loan of      the author computes on   years payments instead of   and says in express terms that take   from    and there remains    these are not errors of the pen or the press the several computations pursued in this part of the work with great diligence and earnestness prove them errors upon much deliberation thus the premiums in      are cast up l  0000 too little an error in the first rule of arithmetic the annuities borrowed in      and      are says he to continue till redeemed by parliament he does not take notice that the first are irredeemable till february      the other till july      in this the amount of the premiums is computed on the time which they have run weakly and ignorantly for he might have added to this and strengthened his argument such as it is by charging also the value of the additional   per cent from the day on which he wrote to at least that day on which these annuities become redeemable to make ample amends however he has added to the premiums of    per cent in      and   per cent in    0 the annuity paid for them since their commencement the fallacy of which is manifest for the premiums in these cases can be neither more or less than the additional capital for which the public stands engaged and is just the same whether   or  00 years annuity has been paid for it in private life no man persuades himself that he has borrowed l  00 because he happens to have paid  0 years interest on loan of l  00  see smart and demoivre     however for argument i am content to take his state of it the debt was and is enormous the war was expensive the best economy had not perhaps been used but i must observe that war and economy are things not easily reconciled and that the attempt of leaning toward parsimony in such a state may be the worst management and in the end the worst economy in the world hazarding the total loss of all the charge incurred and of every thing else along with it  but cui bono all this detail of our debt has the author given a single light toward any material reduction of it not a glimmering we shall see in its place what sort of thing he proposes but before he commences his operations in order to scare the public imagination he raises by art magic a thick mist before our eyes through which glare the most ghastly and horrible phantoms hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necesse est non radii solis neque lucida tela diei discutiant sed naturae species ratioque let us therefore calmly if we can for the fright into which he has put us appreciate those dreadful and deformed gorgons and hydras which inhabit the joyless regions of an imagination fruitful in nothing but the production of monsters  his whole representation is founded on the supposed operation of our debt upon our manufactures and our trade to this cause he attributes a certain supposed dearness of the necessaries of life which must compel our manufacturers to emigrate to cheaper countries particularly to france and with them the manufacture thence consumption declining and with it revenue he will not permit the real balance of our trade to be estimated so high as l   00000 and the interest of the debt to foreigners carries off l   00000 of that balance that france is not in the same condition then follow his wailings and lamentings which he renews over and over according to his custom  a declining trade and decreasing specie  on the point of becoming tributary to france  of losing ireland  of having the colonies torn away from us  the first thing upon which i shall observe is what he takes for granted as the clearest of all propositions the emigration of our manufacturers to in a course of years a few manufacturers have been tempted abroad not by cheap living but by immense premiums to set up as masters and to introduce the manufacture this must happen in every country eminent for the skill of its artificers and has nothing to do with taxes and the price of provision   but leaving the authors speculations the fact is they have not deserted and of course the manufacture cannot be departed or departing with them i am not indeed able to get at all the details of all our manufacture though i think i have taken full as much pains for that purpose as our author some i have by me and they do not hitherto thank god support the authors complaint unless a vast increase of the quantity of goods manufactured be a proof of losing the manufacture on a view of the registers in the west riding of yorkshire for three years before the war and for the three last it appears that the quantities of cloths entered were as follow pieces broad pieces narrow       0                                       0 0                        pieces broad pieces narrow           0                                 0               years ending                        years ending                      increase        increase         in this manner this capital branch of manufacture has increased under the increase of taxes and this not from a declining but from a greatly flourishing period of commerce i may say the same on the best authority of the fabric of thin goods at halifax of the bays at rochdale and of that infinite variety of admirable manufactures that grow and extend every year among the spirited inventive and enterprizing traders of manchester  a trade sometimes seems to perish when it only assumes a different form thus the coarsest woollens were formerly exported in great quantities to russia the russians now supply themselves with these goods but the export thither of finer cloths has increased in proportion as the other has declined possibly some parts of the kingdom may have felt something like a languor in business objects like trade and manufacture which the very attempt to confine would certainly destroy frequently change their place and thereby far from being lost are often highly improved thus some manufactures have decayed in the west and south which have made new and more vigorous shoots when transplanted into the north and here it is impossible to pass by though the author has said nothing upon it the vast addition to the mass of british trade which has been made by the improvement of scotland what does he think of the commerce of the city of glasgow and of the manufactures of paisley and all the adjacent county has this any thing like the deadly aspect and facies hippocratica which the false diagnostic of our state physician has given to our trade in general has he not heard of the iron works of such magnitude even in their cradle which are set up on the carron which at the same time have drawn nothing from sheffield birmingham or wolverhampton  this might perhaps be enough to show the entire falsity of the complaint concerning the decline of our manufactures but every step we advance this matter clears up more and more and the false terrors of the author are dissipated and fade away as the light appears the trade and manufactures of this country says he going to ruin and a diminution of our revenue from consumption must attend the loss of so many seamen and artificers nothing more true than the general observation nothing more false than its application to our circumstances let the revenue on consumption speak for itself l average of net excise since the new duties   years ending          0     ditto for   years before the new duties   years ending                average increase l       0 0 here is no diminution here is on the contrary an immense increase this is owing i shall be told to the new duties which may increase the total bulk but at the same time may make some diminution of the produce of the old were this the fact it would be far from supporting the authors complaint it might have proved that the burden lay rather too heavy but it would never prove that the revenue from consumption was impaired which was his business to do but what is the real fact let us take as the best instance for the purpose the produce of the old hereditary and temporary excise granted in the reign of charles the second whose object is that of most of the new impositions from two averages each of   years l average first period   years ending              ditto second period   years ending in              increase l        i have taken these averages as including in each a war and a peace period the first before the imposition of the new duties the other since those impositions and such is the state of the oldest branch of the revenue from consumption besides the acquisition of so much new this article to speak of no other has rather increased under the pressure of all those additional taxes to which the author is pleased to attribute its destruction but as the author has made his grand effort against those moderate judicious and necessary levies which support all the dignity the credit and the power of his country the reader will excuse a little further detail on this subject that we may see how little oppressive those taxes are on the shoulders of the public with which he labors so earnestly to load its imagination for this purpose we take the state of that specific article upon which the two capital burdens of the war leaned the most immediately by the additional duties on malt and upon beer average of strong beer brewed in   years before the additional malt and beer duties       0   bar average of strong beer   years since the duties   0 0     bar increase in the last period         bar here is the effect of two such daring taxes as  d by the bushel additional on malt and  s by the barrel additional on beer two impositions laid without remission one upon the neck of the other and laid upon an object which before had been immensely loaded they did not in the least impair the consumption it has grown under them it appears that upon the whole the people did not feel so much inconvenience from the new duties as to oblige them to take refuge in the private brewery quite the contrary happened in both these respects in the reign of king william and it happened from much slighter impositions although the public brewery has considerably increased in this latter period the produce of the malt tax has been something less than in the former this cannot be attributed to the new malt tax had this been the cause of the lessened consumption the public brewery so much more burdened must have felt it more the cause of this diminution of the malt tax i take to have been principally owing to the greater dearness of corn in the second period than the first which in all its consequences affected the people in the country much more than those in the towns but the revenue from consumption was not on the whole impaired as we have seen in the foregoing page  no people can long consume a commodity for which they are not well able to pay an enlightened reader laughs at the inconsistent chimera of our author of a people universally luxurious and at the same time oppressed with taxes and declining in trade for my part i cannot look on these duties as the author does he sees nothing but the burden i can perceive the burden as well as he but i cannot avoid contemplating also the strength that supports it from thence i draw the most comfortable assurances of the future vigor and the ample resources of this great misrepresented country and can never prevail on myself to make complaints which have no cause in order to raise hopes which have no foundation  when a representation is built on truth and nature one member supports the other and mutual lights are given and received from every part thus as our manufacturers have not deserted nor the manufacture left us nor the consumption declined nor the revenue sunk so neither has trade which is at once the result measure and cause of the whole in the least decayed as our author has thought proper sometimes to affirm constantly to suppose as if it were the most indisputable of all propositions the readear will see below the comparative state of our trade in three of the best years before our increase of debt and taxes and with it the three last years since the authors date of our ruin total imports value exports ditto l l                                      0

and    millions in the three years preceding the war it was no more than from    to    millions the average balance of the former period was l    0  000 of the latter something above four millions it is true that whilst the impressions of the authors destructive war continued our trade was greater than it is at present one of the necessary consequences of the peace was that france must gradually recover a part of those markets of which she had been originally in possession however after all these deductions still the gross trade in the worst year of the present is better than in the best year of any former period of peace a very great part of our taxes is not the greatest has been imposed since the beginning of this century on the authors principles this continual increase of taxes must have ruined our trade or at least entirely checked its growth but i have a manuscript of davenant which contains an abstract of our trade for the years   0  and   0  by which it appears that the whole export from england did not then exceed l       0   it is now considerably more than double that amount yet england was then a rich and flourishing nation  the author endeavors to derogate from the balance in our favor as it stands on the entries and reduces it from   millions as it there appears to no more than l    00 000 his observation on the looseness and inaccuracy of the export entries is just and that the error is always an error of excess i readily admit but because as usual he has wholly omitted some very material facts his conclusion is as erroneous as the entries he complains of  on this point of the customhouse entries i shall make a few observations  st the inaccuracy of these entries can extend only to free goods that is to such british products and manufactures as are exported without drawback and without bounty which do not in general amount to more than two thirds at the very utmost of the whole export even of our home products the valuable articles of corn malt leather hops beer and many others do not come under this objection of inaccuracy the article of certificate goods reexported a vast branch of our commerce admits of no error except some smaller frauds which cannot be estimated as they have all a drawback of duty and the exporter must therefore correctly specify their quantity and kind the author therefore is not warranted from the known error in some of the entries to make a general defalcation from the whole balance in our favor this error cannot affect more than half if so much of the export article  dly in the account made up at the inspector generals office they estimate only the original cost of british products as they are here purchased and on foreign goods only the prices in the country from whence they are sent this was the method established by mr davenant and as far as it goes it certainly is a good one but the profits of the merchant at home and of our factories abroad are not taken into the account which profit on such an immense quantity of goods exported and reexported cannot fail of being very great five per cent upon the whole i should think a very moderate allowance  dly it does not comprehend the advantage arising from the employment of  00 000 tons of shipping which must be paid by the foreign consumer and which in many bulky articles of commerce is equal to the value of the commodity this can scarcely be rated at less than a million annually  thly the whole import from ireland and america and from the west indies is set against us in the ordinary way of striking a balance of imports and exports whereas the import and export are both our own this is just as ridiculous as to put against the general balance of the nation how much more goods cheshire receives from london than london from cheshire the whole revolves and circulates through this kingdom and is so far as it regards our profit in the nature of home trade as much as if the several countries of america and ireland were all pieced to cornwall the course of exchange with all these places is fully sufficient to demonstrate that this kingdom has the whole advantage of their commerce when the final profit upon a whole system of trade rests and centers in a certain place a balance struck in that place merely on the mutual sale of commodities is quite fallacious  thly the customhouse entries furnish a most defective and indeed ridiculous idea of the most valuable branch of trade we have in the world that with newfoundland observe what you export thither a little spirits provision fishing lines and fishing hooks is this export the true idea of the newfoundland trade in the light of a beneficial branch of commerce nothing less examine our imports from thence it seems upon this vulgar idea of exports and imports to turn the balance against you but your exports to newfoundland are your own goods your import is your own food as much your own as that you raise with your ploughs out of your own soil and not your loss but your gain your riches not your poverty but so fallacious is this way of judging that neither the export nor import nor both together supply any idea approaching to adequate of that branch of business the vessels in that trade go strait from newfoundland to the foreign market and the sale there not the import here is the measure of its value that trade which is one of your greatest and best is hardly so much as seen in the customhouse entries and it is not of less annual value to this nation than l  00 000  thly the quality of your imports must be considered as well as the quantity to state the whole of the foreign import as loss is exceedingly absurd all the iron hemp flax cotton spanish wool raw silk woolen and linen yarn which we import are by no means to be considered as the matter of a merely luxurious consumption which is the idea too generally and loosely annexed to our import article these abovementioned are materials of industry not of luxury which are wrought up here in many instances to ten times and more of their original value even where they are not subservient to our exports they still add to our internal wealth which consists in the stock of useful commodities as much as in gold and silver in looking over the specific articles of our export and import i have often been astonished for how small a part of the supply of our consumption either luxurious or convenient we are indebted to nations properly foreign to us  these considerations are entirely passed over by the author they have been but too much neglected by most who have speculated on this subject but they ought never to be omitted by those who mean to come to any thing like the true state of the british trade they compensate and they more than compensate every thing which the author can cut off with any appearance of reason for the overentry of british goods and they restore to us that balance of four millions which the author has thought proper on such a very poor and limited comprehension of the object to reduce to l    00 000  in general this author is so circumstanced that to support his theory he is obliged to assume his facts and then if you allow his facts they will not support his conclusions what if all he says of the state of this balance were true did not the same objections always lie to customhouse entries do they defalcate more from the entries of      than from those of      if they prove us ruined we were always ruined some ravens have always indeed croaked out this kind of song they have a malignant delight in presaging mischief when they are not employed in doing it they are miserable and disapointed at every instance of the public prosperity they overlook us like the malevolent being of the poet  tritonida conspicit arcem ingeniis opibusque et festa pace virentem vixque tenet lacrymas quia nil lacrymabile vidit it is in this spirit that some have looked upon those accidents that cast an occasional damp upon trade their imaginations entail these accidents upon us in perpetuity we have had some bad harvests this must very disadvantageously affect the balance of trade and the navigation of a people so large a part of whose commerce is in grain but in knowing the cause we are morally certain that according to the course of events it cannot long subsist in the three last years we have exported scarcely any grain in good years that export has been worth twelve hundred thousand pounds and more in the two last years far from exporting we have been obliged to import to the amount perhaps of our former exportation so that in this article the balance must be l   000 000 against us that is one million in the ceasing of gain the other in the increase of expenditure but none of the authors promises or projects could have prevented this misfortune and thank god we do not want him or them to relieve us from it although if his friends should now come into power i doubt not but they will be ready to take credit for any increase of trade or excise that may arise from the happy circumstance of a good harvest  this connects with his loud laments and melancholy prognostications concerning the high price of the necessaries of life and the products of labor with all his others i deny this fact and i again call upon him to prove it take average and not accident the grand and first necessary of life is cheap in this country and that too as weighed not against labor which is its true counterpoise but against money does he call the price of wheat at this day between    and  0 shillings per quarter in london dear it is dearer in some places and rather cheaper in others but it must soon all come to a level  he must know that fuel an object of the highest order in the necessaries of life and of the first necessity in almost every kind of manufacture is in many of our provinces cheaper than in any part of the globe meat is on the whole not excessively dear whatever its price may be at particular times and from particular accidents if it has had any thing like an uniform rise this enhancement may easily be proved not to be owing to the increase of taxes but to uniform increase of consumption and of money diminish the latter and meat in your markets will be sufficiently cheap in account but much dearer in effect because fewer will be in a condition to buy thus your apparent plenty will be real indigence at present even under temporary disadvantages the use of flesh is greater here than any where else it is continued without any interruption of lents or meagre days it is sustained and growing even with the increase of our taxes but some have the art of converting even the signs of national prosperity into symptoms of decay and ruin and our author who so loudly disclaims popularity never fails to lay hold of the most vulgar popular prejudices and humors in hopes to captivate the crowd even those peevish dispositions which grow out of some transitory suffering those passing clouds which float in our changeable atmosphere are by him industriously figured into frightful shapes in order first to terrify and then to govern the populace  it was not enough for the authors purpose to give this false and discouraging picture of the state of his own country it did not fully answer his end to exaggerate her butthens to depreciate her successes and to vilify her character nothing had been done unless the situation of france were exalted in proportion as that of england had been abased the reader will excuse the citation i make at length from his book he outdoes himself upon this occasion his confidence is indeed unparalleled and altogether of the heroic cast  if our rival nations were in the same circumstances with ourselves the augmentation of our taxes would produce no ill consequences if we were obliged to raise our prices they must from the same causes do the like and could take no advantage by underselling and underworking us but the alarming consideration to great britain is that france is not in the same condition her distresses during the war were great but they were immediate her want of credit as has been said compelled her to impoverish her people by raising the greatest part of her supplies within the year but the burdens she imposed on them were in a great measure temporary and must be greatly diminished by a few years of peace she could procure no considerable loans therefore she has mortgaged no such oppressive taxes as those of great britain has imposed in perpetuity for payment of interest peace must therefore soon reestablish her commerce and manufactures especially as the comparative lightness of taxes and the cheapness of living in that country must make france an asylum for british manufactures and artificers on this the author rests the merits of his whole system and on this point i will join issue with him if france is not at least in the same condition even in that very condition which the author falsely represents to be ours if the very reverse of his proposition be not true then i will admit his state of the nation to be just and all his inferences from that state to be logical and conclusive it is not surprising that the author should hazard our opinion of his veracity that is a virtue on which great statesmen do not perhaps pique themselves so much but it is somewhat extraordinary that he should stake on a very poor calculation of chances all credit for care for accuracy and for knowledge of the subject of which he treats he is rash and inaccurate because he thinks he writes to a public ignorant and inattentive but he may find himself in that respect as in many others greatly mistaken  in order to contrast the light and vigorous condition of france with that of england weak and sinking under her burdens he states in his  0th page that france had raised l  0         sterling by taxes within the several years from the year      to      both inclusive an englishman must stand aghast at such a representation to find france able to raise within the year sums little inferior to all that we were able even to borrow on interest with all the resources of the greatest and most established credit in the world europe was filled with astonishment when they saw england borrow in one year twelve millions it was thought and very justly no small proof of national strength and financial skill to find a sund for the payment of the interest upon this sum the interest of this computed with the one per cent annuities amounted only to l  00000 a year this i say was thought a surprising effort even of credit but this author talks as of a thing not worth proving and but just worth observing that france in one year raised sixteen times that sum without borrowing and continued to raise sums not far from equal to it for several years together suppose some jacob henriques had proposed in the year      to prevent a perpetual charge on the nation by raising ten millions within the year he would be considered not as a harsh financier who laid an heavy hand on the public but as a poor visionary who had run mad on supplies and taxes they who know that the whole land tax of england at  s in the pound raises but two millions will not easily apprehend that any such sums as the author has conjured up can be raised even in the most opulent nations france owed a large debt and was incumbered with heavy establishments before that war the author does not formally deny that she borrowed something in every year of its continuance let him produce the funds for this astonishing annual addition to all her vast preceding taxes an addition equal to the whole excise customs land and malt taxes of england taken together  but what must be the readers astonishment perhaps his indignation if he should find that this great financier has fallen into the most unaccountable of all errors no less an error than that of mistaking the identical sums borrowed by france upon interest for supplies raised within the year can it be conceived that any man only entered into the first rudiments of finance should make so egregious a blunder should write it should print it should carry it to a second edition should take it not collaterally and incidentally but lay it down as the corner stone of his whole system in such an important point as the comparative states of france and england but it will be said that it was his misfortune to be ill informed not at all a man of any loose general knowledge and of the most ordinary sagacity never could have been misinformed in so gross a manner because he would have immediately rejected so wild and extravagant an account  the fact is this the credit of france bad as it might have been did enable her not to raise within the year but to borrow the very sums the author mentions that is to say   0        livres making in the authors computation l  0       the credit of france was low but it was not annihilated she did not derive as our author chooses to assert any advantages from the debility of her credit its consequence was the natural one she borrowed but she borrowed upon bad terms indeed on the most exorbitant usury  in speaking of a foreign revenue the very pretense to accuracy would be the most inaccurate thing in the world neither the author nor i can with certainty authenticate the information we communicate to the public nor in an affair of eternal fluctuation arrive at perfect exactness all we can do and this we may be expected to do is to avoid gross errors and blunders of a capital nature we cannot order the proper officer to lay the accounts before the house but the reader must judge on the probability of the accounts we lay before him the author speaks of france as raising her supplies for war by taxes within the year and of her debt as a thing scarcely worthy of notice i affirm that she borrowed large sums in every year and has thereby accumulated an immense debt this debt continued after the war infinitely to embarrass her affairs and to find some means for its reduction was then and has ever since been the first object of her policy but she has so little succeeded in all her efforts that the perpetual debt of france is at this hour little short of l  00000000 sterling that she stands charged with at least  0000000 of english pounds of liferents and tontines the annuities paid at this day at the hotel de ville of paris which are by no means her sole payments of that nature amount to    000000 of livres that is to     000 pounds besides billets an porteur and various detached and unfunded debts to a great amount and which bear an interest  at the end of the war the interest payable on her debt amounted to upwards of seven millions sterling m de la verdy the last hope of the french finances was called in to aid in the reduction of an interest so light to our author so intolerably heavy upon thosewho are to pay it after many unsuccessful efforts toward reconciling arbitrary reduction with public credit he was obliged to go the plain high road of power and to impose a tax of  0 per cent upon a very great part of the capital debt of that kingdom and this measure of present ease to the destruction of future credit produced about l  00000 a year which was carried to their caisse damortissement or sinking fund but so unfaithfully and unsteadily has this and all the other articles which compose that fund been applied to their purposes that they have given the state but very little even of present relief since it is known to the whole world that she is behind hand on every one of her establishments since the year      there has been no operation of any consequence on the french finances and in this enviable condition is france at present with regard to her debt  every body knows that the principle of the debt is but a name the interest is the only thing which can distress a nation take this idea which will not be disputed and compare the interest paid by england with that paid by france l interest paid by france funded and unfunded for perpetuity or on lives after the tax of  0 per cent   00000 interest paid by england as stated by the author p      00000 interest paid by france exceeds that paid by england l   00000 the author cannot complain that i state the interest paid by england as too low he takes it himself as the extremest term nobody who knows any thing of the french finances will affirm that i state the interest paid by that kingdom too high it might be easily proved to amount to a great deal more even this is near two millions above what is paid by england  there are three standards to judge of the good condition of a nation with regard to its finances  st the relief of the people  d the equality of supplies to establishments  d the state of public credit try france on all these standards  although our author very liberally administers relief to the people of france its government has not been altogether so gracious since the peace she has taken off but a single vingtieme or shilling in the pound and some small matter in the capitation but if the government has relieved them in one point it has only burdened them the more heavily in another the taille a tax rated by the intendant in each generality on the presumed fortune of every person below the degree of a gentleman  that grievous and destructive imposition which all their financiers lament without being able to remove or to replace has been augmented no less than   millions of livres or   0000 pounds english a further augmentation of this or other duties is now talked of and it is certainly necessary to their affairs so exceedingly remote from either truth or verisimilitude is the authors amazing assertion that the burdens of france in the war were in a great measure temporary and must be greatly diminished by a few years of peace  in the next place if the people of france are not lightened of taxes so neither is the state disburthened of charges i speak from very good information that the annual income of that state is at this day  0 millions of livres or l    0000 sterling short of a provision for their ordinary peace establishment so far are they from the attempt or even hope to discharge any part of the capital of their enormous debt indeed under such extreme straitness and distraction labors the whole body of their finances so far does their charge outrun their supply in every particular that no man i believe who has considered their affairs with any degree of attention or information but must hourly look for some extraordinary convulsion in that whole system the effect of which on france and even on all europe it is difficult to conjecture  in the third point of view their credit let the reader cast his eye on a table of the price of french funds as they stood a few weeks ago compared with the state of some of our english stocks even in their present low condition french   per cents      per cent not taxed      per cent ditto     british bank stock         per cent cons  00   per cent cons     this state of the funds of france and england is sufficient to convince even prejudice and obstinacy that if france and england are not in the same condition as the author affirms they are not the difference is infinitely to the disadvantage of france this depreciation of their funds has not much the air of a nation lightening burdens and discharging debts  such is the true comparative state of the two kingdoms in those capital points of view now as to the nature of the taxes which provide for this debt as well as for their ordinary establishments the author has thought proper to affirm that they are comparatively light that she has mortgaged no such oppressive taxes as ours his effrontery on this head is intolerable does the author recollect a single tax in england to which something parallel in nature and as heavy in burden does not exist in france does he not know that the lands of the noblesse are still under the load of the greater part of the old feudal charges from which the gentry of england have been relieved for upwards of  00 years and which were in kind as well as burden much worse than our modern land tax besides that all the gentry of france serve in the army on very slender pay and to the utter ruin of their fortunes all those who are not noble have their lands heavily taxed does he not know that wine brandy soap candles leather saltpeter gunpowder are taxed in france has he not heard that government in france has made a monopoly of that great article of salt that they compel the people to take a certain quantity of it and at a certain rate both rate and quantity fixed at the arbitrary pleasure of the imposer before the war it was sold to or rather forced on the consumer at    sous or about  d the pound what it is at present i am not informed even this will appear no trivial imposition in london salt may be had at a penny saithing per pound from the last retailer  that they pay in france the taille an arbitrary imposition on presumed property that a tax is laid in fact and name on the same arbitrary standard upon the acquisitions of their industry and that in france a heavy capitationtax is also paid from the highest to the very poorest sort of people have we taxes of such weight or any thing at all of the compulsion in the article of salt do we pay any taillage any facultytax any industrytax do we pay any capitationtax whatsoever i believe the people of london would fall into an agony to hear of such taxes proposed upon them as are paid in paris there is not a single article of provision for man or beast which enters that great city and is not excised corn hay meal butchers meat fish sowls every thing i do not here mean to censure the policy of taxes laid on the consumption of great luxurious cities i only state the fact we should be with difficulty brought to hear of a tax of  0 s upon every ox sold in smithfield yet this tax is paid in paris wine the lower sort of wine little better than english small beer pays  d a bottle we indeed tax our beer but the imposition on small beer is very far from heavy in no part of england are eatables of any kind the object of taxation in almost every other country in europe they are excised more or less in one place or in another i have by me the state of the revenues of many of the principal nations on the continent and on comparing them with ours i think i am fairly warranted to assert that england is the most lightly taxed of any of the great states of europe they whose unnatural and sullen joy arises from a contemplation of the distresses of their country will revolt at this position but if i am called upon i will prove it beyond all possibility of dispute even though this proof should deprive these gentlemen of the singular satisfaction of considering their country as undone and though the best civil government the best constituted and the best managed revenue that ever the world beheld should be thoroughly vindicated from their perpetual clamours and complaints as to our neighbor and rival france in addition to what i have here suggested i say and when the author chooses formally to deny i shall formally prove it that her subjects pay more than england on a computation of the wealth of both countries that her taxes are more injudiciously and more oppressively imposed more vexatiously collected come in a smaller proportion to the royal coffers and are less applied by far to the public service i am not one of those who choose to take the authors word for this happy and flourishing condition of the french finances rather than attend to the changes the violent pushes and the despair of all her own financiers does he choose to be referred for the easy and happy condition of the subject in france to the remonstrances of their own parliaments written with such an eloquence feeling and energy as i have not seen exceeded in any other writings the author may say their complaints are exaggerated and the effects of faction i answer that they are the representations of numerous grave and most respectable bodies of men upon the affairs of their own country but allowing that discontent and faction may pervert the judgment of such venerable bodies in france we have as good a right to suppose that the same causes may full as probably have produced from a private however respectable person that frightful and i trust i have shown groundless representation of our own affairs in england  the author is so conscious of the dangerous effects of that representation that he thinks it necessary and very necessary it is to guard against them he assures us that he has not made that display of the difficulties of his country to expose her counsels to the ridicule of other states or to provoke a vanquished enemy to insult her nor to excite the peoples rage against their governors or sink them into a despondency of the public welfare i readily admit this apology for his intentions god forbid i should think any man capable of entertaining so execrable and senseless a design the true cause of his drawing so shocking a picture is no more than this and it ought rather to claim our pity than excite our indignation he finds himself out of power and this condition is intolerable to him the same sun which gilds all nature and exhilarates the whole creation does not shine upon disappointed ambition it is something that rays out of darkness and inspires nothing but gloom and melancholy men in this deplorable state of mind find a comfort in spreading the contagion of their spleen they find an advantage too for it is a general popular error to imagine the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare if such persons can answer the ends of relief and profit to themselves they are apt to be careless enough about either the means or the consequences  whatever this complainants motives may be the effects can by no possibility be other than those which he so strongly and i hope truly disclaims all intention of producing to verify this the reader has only to consider how dreadful a picture he has drawn in his   d page of the state of this kingdom such a picture as i believe has hardly been applicable without some exaggeration to the most degenerate and undone commonwealth that ever existed let this view of things be compared with the prospect of a remedy which he proposes in the page directly opposite and the subsequent i believe no man living could have imagined it possible except for the sake of burlesquing a subject to propose remedies so ridiculously disproportionate to the evil so full of uncertainty in their operation and depending for their success in every step upon the happy event of so many new dangerous and visionary projects it is not amiss that he has thought proper to give the public some little notice of what they may expect from his friends when our affairs shall be committed to their management let us see how the accounts of disease and remedy are balanced in his state of the nation in the first place on the side of evils he states an impoverished and heavilyburthened public a declining trade and decreasing specie the power of the crown never so much extended over the great but the great without influence over the lower sort parliament losing its reverence with the people the voice of the multitude set up against the sense of the legislature a people luxurious and licentious impatient of rule and despising all authority government relaxed in every sinew and a corrupt selfish spirit pervading the whole an opinion of many that the form of government is not worth contending for no attachment in the bulk of the people toward the constitution no reverence for the customs of our ancestors no attachment but to private interest nor any zeal but for selfish gratifications trade and manufactures going to ruin great britain in danger of becoming tributary to france and the descent of the crown dependent on her pleasure ireland in case of war to become a prey to france and great britain unable to recover ireland cede it by treaty the author never can think of a treaty without making cessions in order to purchase peace for herself the colonies left exposed to the ravages of a domestic or the conquest of a foreign enemy  gloomy enough god knows the author well observes that a mind not totally devoid of feeling cannot look upon such a prospect without horror and an heart capable of humanity must be unable to bear its description he ought to have added that no man of common discretion ought to have exhibited it to the public if it were true or of common honesty if it were false  but now for the comfort the day star which is to arise in our hearts the authors grand scheme for totally reversing this dismal state of things and making us happy at home and respected abroad formidable in war and flourishing in peace  in this great work he proceeds with a facility equally astonishing and pleasing never was financier less embarassed by the burden of establishments or with the difficulty of finding ways and means if an establishment is troublesome to him he lops off at a stroke just as much of it as he chooses he mows down without giving quarter or assigning reason army navy ordnance ordinary extraordinaries nothing can stand before him then when he comes to provide amaltheas horn is in his hands and he pours out with an inexhaustible bounty taxes duties loans and revenues without uneasiness to himself or burden to the public insomuch that when we consider the abundance of his resources we cannot avoid being surprised at his extraordinary attention to savings but it is all the exuberance of his goodness  this book has so much of a certain tone of power that one would be almost tempted to think it written by some person who had been in high office a man is generally rendered somewhat a worse reasoner for having been a minister in private the assent of listening and obsequious friends in public the venal cry and prepared vote of a passive senate confirm him in habits of begging the question with impunity and asserting without thinking himself obliged to prove had it not been for some such habits the author could never have expected that we should take his estimate for a peace establishment solely on his word  this estimate which he gives is the great groundwork of his plan for the national redemption and it ought to be well and firmly laid natural course and what would be expected from a man of business but this author takes a very different method for the ground of his speculation of a present peace establishment he resorts to a former speculation of the same kind which was in the mind of the minister of the year      indeed it never existed any where else the plan says has been already formed and the outline drawn by the administration of      i shall attempt to fill up the void and obliterated parts and trace its operation the standing expense of the present his projected peace establishment improved by the experience of the two last years may be thus estimated and he estimates it at l            here too it would be natural to expect some reasons for condemning the subsequent actual establishments which have so much transgressed the limits of his plan of      as well as some arguments in favor of his new project which has in some articles exceeded in others fallen short but on the whole is much below his old one hardly a word on any of these points the only points however that are in the least essential for unless you assign reasons for the increase or diminution of the several articles of public charge the playing at establishments and estimates is an amusement of no higher order and of much less ingenuity than questions and commands or what is my thought like to bring more distinctly under the readers view this authors strange method of proceeding i will lay before him the three schemes viz the idea of the ministers in      the actual estimates of the two last years as given by the author himself and lastly the new project of his political millennium l plan of establishment for      as by considerations p    the figures in the considerations are wrong cast up it should be l    0   00    0   00 medium of      and      as by state of the nation p    and  0           present peace establishment as by the project in state of the nation p               it is not from any thing our author has any where said that you are enabled to find the ground much less the justification of the immense difference between these several systems you must compare them yourself article by article no very pleasing employment by the way to compare the agreement or disagreement of two chimeras i now only speak of the comparison of his own two projects as to the latter of them it differs from the former by having some of the articles diminished and others increased i find the chief article of reduction arises from consid p    st of n p    the smaller deficiency of land and malt and of the annuity funds which he brings down to l     000 in his new estimate from l  0   00 which he had allowed for those articles in the considerations with this reduction owing as it must be merely to a smaller deficiency of funds he has nothing at all to do it can be no work and no merit of his but with regard to the increase the matter is very different it is all his own the public is loaded for any thing we can see to the contrary entirely gratis the chief articles of the increase are on the navy and on the army and ordnance extraordinaries the navy being estimated in his state of the nation consid p    s of n l    l  0 000 a year more and the army and ordnance extraordinaries l  0 000 more than he had thought proper to allow for them in that estimate in his considerations which he makes the foundation of his present project he has given no sort of reason stated no sort of necessity for this additional allowance either in the one article or the other what is still stronger he admits that his allowance for the army and ordnance extras is too great and expressly refers you to the considerations where far from state of the nation has done the author apprehends his own scanty provision of l    000 to be by far too considerable and thinks it may well admit of further reductions the author of the state of the nation p    informs us that the sum of l    000 allowed by him for the extras of the army and ordnance is far less than was allowed for the same service in the years      and      it is so undoubtedly and by at least l  00 000 he sees that he cannot abide by the plan of the considerations in this point nor is he willing wholly to give it up such an enormous difference as that between l    000 and l  00 000 puts him to a stand should he adopt the latter plan of increased expense he must then confess that he had on a former occasion egregiously trifled with the public at the same time all his future promises of reduction must fall to the ground if he stuck to the l    000 he was sure that every one must expect from him some account how this monstrous charge came to continue ever since the war when it was clearly unnecessary how all those successions of ministers his own included came to pay it and why his great friend in parliament and his partisans without doors came not to pursue to ruin at least to utter shame the authors of so groundless and scandalous a profusion in this strait he took a middle way and to come nearer the real state of the service he outbid the considerations at one stroke l  0 000 at the same time he hints to you that you may expect some benefit also from the original plan but the author of the considerations will not suffer him to escape so he has pinned him down to his l    000 for that is the sum he has chosen not as what he thinks will probably be required but as making the most ample allowance for every possible contingency see that author p    and     thus according to his own principles this great oeconomist falls into a vicious prodigality and is as far in his estimates from a consistency with his own principles as with the real nature of the services  still however his present establishment differs from its archetype of      by being though raised in particular parts upon the whole about l     000 smaller it is improved he tells us by the experience of the two last years one would have concluded that the peace establishment of these two years had been less than that of      in order to suggest to the author his improvements which enabled him to reduce it but how does that turn out  l peace establishment he has done great injustice to the establishment of      but i have not here time for this discussion nor is it necessary to this argument      and      medium           ditto estimate in the considerations for         0   00 difference l  0       a vast increase instead of diminution the experience then of the two last years ought naturally to have given the idea of an heavier establishment but this writer is able to diminish by increasing and to draw the effects of subtraction from the operations of addition by means of these new powers he may certainly do whatever he pleases he is indeed moderate enough in the use of them and condescends to settle his establishment at l           a year  however he has not yet done with it he has further ideas of saving and new resources of revenue these additional savings are principally two  st it is to be hoped says he that the sum of l   0 000 which in the estimate he allows for the deficiency of land and malt will be less in making up this account he falls into a surprising error of arithmetic the deficiency  s amounted to no more on a medium than l        to which if we add half the sum it will give us l    0   as the peace deficiency at  s  l total        add the half        result l    0    which he makes l    0   this is indeed in disfavour of his argument but we shall see that he has ways by other errors of reimbursing himself      d that the sum of l  0 000 allowed for the foundling hospital and l    00 for american surveys will soon cease to be necessary as the services will be completed  what follows with regard to the resources is very well worthy of the of this estimate says he upwards of l  00 000 will be for the plantation service and that sum i hope the people of ireland and the colonies might be induced to take off great britain and defray between them in the proportion of l  00 000 by the colonies and l  00 000 by ireland  such is the whole of this mighty scheme take his reduced estimate and his further reductions and his resources all together and the result will be he will certainly lower the provision made for the navy he will cut off largely god knows what or how from the army and ordnance extraordinaries he may be expected to cut off more he hopes that the deficiencies on land and malt will be less than usual and he hopes that america and ireland might be induced to take off l  00000 of our annual charges  if any one of these hopes mights insinuations expectations and inducements should fail him there will be a formidable gaping breach in his whole project if all of them should fail he has left the nation without a glimmering of hope in this thick night of terrors which he has thought fit to spread about us if every one of them which attended with success would signify any thing to our revenue can have no effect but to add to our distractions and dangers we shall be if possible in a still worse condition from his projects of cure than he represents us from our original disorders  before we examine into the consequence of these schemes and the probability of these savings let us suppose them all real and all safe and then see what it is they amount to and how he reasons on them l deficiency on land and malt less by   000 foundling hospital  0000 american surveys   00 l    00 this is the amount of the only articles of saving he specisies and yet that we may venture on the credit of them to reduce the standing expenses of the estimate from l         to l   00000 that is for a saving of l   000 he is not ashamed to take credit for a defalcation from his own ideal establishment in a sum of no less than l        suppose even that we were to take up the estimate of the considerations which is however abandoned in the state of the nation and reduce his l   000 extraordinaries to the original l   000 still all these savings joined together give us but l   000 that is near l  0000 short of the credit he calls for and for which he has neither given any reason or furnished any data whatsoever for others to reason upon  such are his savings as operating on his own project of a peace establishment let us now consider them as they affect the existing establishment and our actual services he tells us the sum allowed in his estimate for the navy is l       less than the grant for that service in      but in that grant l  0000 was included for the purchase of hemp and a saving of about l   000 was made in that year the author has got some secret in arithmetic these two sums put together amount in the ordinary way of computing to l   000 and not to l       on what principle has he chosen to take credit for l       more to what this strange inaccuracy is owing i cannot possibly comprehend nor is it very material where the logic is so bad and the policy so erroneous whether the arithmetic be just or otherwise but in a scheme for making this nation happy at home and respected abroad formidable in war and flourishing in peace it is surely a little unfortunate for us that he has picked out the navy as the very first object of his oeconomical experiments of all the public services that of the navy is the one in which tampering may be of the greatest danger which can worst be supplied upon an emergency and of which any failure draws after it the longest and heaviest train of consequences i am far from saying that this or any service ought not to be conducted with economy but i will never suffer the sacred name of economy to be bestowed upon arbitrary defalcation of charge the author tells us himself that to suffer the navy to rot in harbor for want of repairs and marines would be to invite destruction it would so when the author talks therefore of savings on the navy estimate it is incumbent on him to let us know not what sums he will cut off but what branch of that service he deems superfluous instead of putting us off with unmeaning generalities he ought to have stated what naval force what naval works and what naval stores with the lowest estimated expense are necessary to keep our marine in a condition commensurate to its great ends and this too not for the contracted and deceitful space of a single year but for some reasonable term every body knows that many charges cannot be in their nature regular or annual in the year      a stock of hemp etc was to be laid in that charge intermits but it does not end other charges of other kinds take their place great works are now carrying on at portsmouth but not of greater magnitude than utility and they must be provided for a years estimate is therefore no just idea at all of a permanent peace establishment had the author opened this matter upon these plain principles a judgment might have been formed how far he had contrived to reconcile national defense with public economy till he has done it those who had rather depend on any mans reason than the greatest mans authority will not give him credit on this head for the saving of a single shilling as to those savings which are already made or in course of being made whether right or wrong he has nothing at all to do with them they can be no part of his project considered as a plan of reformation i greatly fear that the error has not lately been on the side of profusion  another head is the saving on the army and ordnance extraordinaries particularly in the american branch what or how much reduction may be made none of us i believe can with any fairness pretend to say very little i am convinced the state of america is extremely unsettled more troops have been sent thither new dispositions have been made and this augmentation of number and change of disposition has rarely i believe the effect of lessening the bill for extraordinaries which if not this year yet in the next we must certainly feel care has not been wanting to introduce economy into that part of the service the authors great friend has made i admit some regulations his immediate successors have made more and better this part will be handled more ably and more minutely at another time but none can cut down this bill of extraordinaries at his pleasure the author has given us nothing but his word for any certain or considerable reduction and this we ought to be the more cautious in taking as he has promised great savings in his considerations which he has not chosen to abide by in his state of the nation  on this head also of the american extraordinaries he can take credit for nothing as to his next the lessening of the deficiency of the land and malttax particularly of the malttax any person the least conversant in that subject cannot avoid a smile this deficiency arises from charge of collection from anticipation and from defective produce what has the author said on the reduction of any head of this deficiency upon the land tax on these points he is absolutely silent as to the deficiency on the malt tax which is chiefly owing to a defective produce he has and can have nothing to propose if this deficiency should be lessened by the increase of malting in any years more than others as it is a greatly fluctuating object how much of this obligation shall we owe to this authors ministry will it not be the case under any administration must it not go to the general service of the year in some way or other let the finances be in whose hands they will but why take credit for so extremely reduced a deficiency at all i can tell him he has no rational ground for it in the produce of the year      and i suspect will have full as little reason from the produce of the year      that produce may indeed become greater and the deficiency of course will be less it may too be far otherwise a fair and judicious financier will not as this writer has done for the sake of making out a specious account select a favorable year or two at remote periods and ground his calculations on those in      he will not take the deficiencies of      and      for his standard sober men have hitherto and must continue this course to preserve this character taken indifferently the mediums of the years immediately preceding but a person who has a scheme from which he promises much to the public ought to be still more cautious he would choose to ground his speculation rather on the lowest mediums because all new schemes are known to be subject to some defect or failure not foreseen and which therefore every prudent proposer will be ready to allow for in order to lay his foundation as low and as solid as possible quite contrary is the practice of some politicians they first propose savings which they well know cannot be made in order to get a reputation for economy in due time they assume another but a different merit by providing for the service they had before cut off or straitened and which they can then very easily prove to be necessary in the same spirit they raise magnificent ideas of revenue on funds which they know to be insufficient afterward who can blame them if they do not satisfy the public desires they are great artificers but they cannot work without materials  these are some of the little arts of great statesmen to such we leave them and follow where the author leads us to his next resource the foundlinghospital whatever particular virtue there is in the mode of this saving there seems to be nothing at all new and indeed nothing wonderfully important in it the sum annually voted for the support of the foundlinghospital has been in a former parliament limited to the establishment of the children then in the hospital when they are apprenticed this provision will cease it will therefore fall in more or less at different times and will at length cease entirely but until it does we cannot reckon upon it as the saving on the establishment of any given year nor can any one conceive how the author comes to mention this any more than some other articles as a part of a new plan of economy which is to retrieve our affairs this charge will indeed cease in its own time but will no other succeed to it has he ever known the public free from some contingent charge either for the just support of royal dignity or for national magnificence or for public charity or for public service does he choose to flatter his readers that no such will ever return or does he in good earnest declare that let the reason or necessity be what they will he is resolved not to provide for such services  another resource of economy yet remains for the gleans the field very closely l    00 for the american surveys why what signifies a dispute about trifles he shall have it but while he is carrying it off i shall just whisper in his ear that neither the saving that is allowed or that which is doubted of can at all belong to that future proposed admistration whose touch is to cure all our evils both the one and the other belong equally as indeed all the rest do to the present administration to any administration because they are the gift of time and not the bounty of the exchequer  i have now done with all the minor preparatory parts of the authors scheme the several articles of saving which he proposes at length comes the capital operation his new resources three hundred thousand pounds a year from america and ireland  alas alas if that too should fail us what will become of this poor undone nation the author in a tone of great humility hopes they may be induced to pay it well if that be all we may hope so too and for any light he is pleased to give us into the ground of this hope and the ways and means of this inducement here is a speedy end both of the question and the revenue  it is the constant custom of this author in all his writings to take it for granted that he has given you a revenue whenever he can point out to you where you may have money if you can contrive how to get at it and this seems to be the masterpiece of his financial ability i think however in his way of proceeding he has behaved rather like an harsh stepdame than a kind nursing mother to his country why stop at l  00 000 if his state of things be at all founded america and ireland are much better able to pay l  00 000 than we are to satisfy ourselves with half that sum however let us forgive him this one instance of tenderness toward ireland and the colonies  he spends a vast deal of time in an endeavor to prove that ireland is able to bear greater impositions he is of opinion that the poverty a want of judicious taxes that a land tax will enrich her tenants that taxes are paid in england which are not paid there that the colony trade is increased above l  00 000 since the peace that she ought to have further indulgences in that trade and ought to have further privileges in the woollen manufacture from these premises of what she has what she has not and what she ought to have he infers that ireland will contribute l  00 000 toward the extraordinaries of the american establishment  i shall make no objections whatsoever logical or financial to this reasoning many occur but they would lead me from my purpose from which i do not intend to be diverted because it seems to me of no small importance it will be just enough to hint what i dare say many readers have before observed that when any man proposes new taxes in a country with which he is not personally conversant by residence or office he ought to lay open its situation much more minutely and critically than this author has done or than perhaps he is able to do he ought not to content himself with saying that a single article of her trade is increased l  00 000 a year he ought if he argues from the increase of trade to an increase of taxes to state the whole trade and not one branch of trade only he ought to enter fully into the state of its remittances and the course of its exchange he ought likewise to examine whether all its establishments are increased or diminished and whether it incurs or discharges debt annually but i pass over all this and am content to ask a few plain questions  does the author then seriously mean to propose in parliament a land tax or any tax for l  00 000 a year upon ireland if he does and that fatally by his temerity and our weakness he should succeed then i say he will throw the whole empire from one end of it to the other into mortal convulsions what is it that can satisfy the furious and perturbed mind of this man is it not enough for him that such projects have alienated our colonies from the mother country and not to propose violently to tear our sister kingdom also from our side and to convince every dependent part of the empire that when a little money is to be raised we have no sort of regard to their ancient customs their opinions their circumstances or their affections he has however a douceur for ireland in his pocket benefits in trade by opening the woollen manufacture to that nation a very right idea in my opinion but not more strong in reason than likely to be opposed by the most powerful and most violent of all local prejudices and popular passions first a fire is already kindled by his schemes of taxation in america he then proposes one which will set all ireland in a blaze and his way of quenching both is by a plan which may kindle perhaps ten times a greater flame in britain  will the author pledge himself previous to his proposal of such a tax to carry this enlargement of the irish trade if he does not then the tax will be certain the benefit will be less than problematical in this view his compensation to ireland vanishes into smoke the tax to their prejudices will appear stark naked in the light of an act of arbitrary power and oppression but if he should propose the benefit and tax together then the people of ireland a very high and spirited people would think it the worst bargain in the world they would look upon the one as wholly vitiated and poisoned by the other and if they could not be separated would infallibly resist them both together here would be taxes indeed amounting to an handsome sum l  00 000 very effectually voted and passed through the best and most authentic forms but how to be collected  this is his perpetual manner one of his projects depends for success upon another project and this upon a third all of them equally visionary his finance is like the indian philosophy his earth is poised on the horns of a bull his bull stands on an elephant his elephant is supported by a tortoise and so on for ever  as to his american l  00 000 a year he is satisfied to repeat gravely as he has done an hundred times before that the americans are able to pay it well and what then does he lay open any part of his plan how they may be compelled to pay it without plunging ourselves into calamities that outweigh ten fold the proposed benefit or does he show how they may be induced to submit to it quietly or does he give any thing like satisfaction concerning the mode of levying it in commercial colonies one of the most important and difficult of all considerations nothing like it to the stamp act whatever its excellencies may be i think he will not in reality recur or even choose to assert that he means to do so in case his minister should come again into power if he does i will predict that some of the fastest friends of that minister will desert him upon this point as to port duties he has damned them all in the lump by declaring them contrary to the first principles of colonization and not less prejudicial to the interests of great britain than to surely this single observation of his ought to have taught him a little caution he ought to have begun to doubt whether there is not something in the nature of commercial colonies which renders them an unfit object of taxation when port duties so large a fund of revenue in almost all countries are by himself found in this case not only improper but destructive however he has here pretty well narrowed the field of taxation stamp act hardly to be resumed port duties mischievous excises i believe he will scarcely think worth the collection if any revenue should be so in america land tax notwithstanding his opinion of its immense use to agriculture he will not directly propose before he has thought again and again on the subject indeed he very readily recommends it for ireland and seems to think it not improper for america because he observes they already raise most of their taxes internally including this tax a most curious reason truly because their lands are already heavily burdened he thinks it right to burden them still further but he will recollect for surely he cannot be ignorant of it that the lands of america are not as in england let at a rent certain in money and therefore cannot as here be taxed at a certain pound rate they value them in gross among themselves and none but themselves in their several districts can value them without their hearty concurrence and cooperation it is evident we cannot advance a step in the assessing or collecting any land tax as to the taxes which in some places the americans pay by the acre they are merely duties of regulation they are small and to increase them notwithstanding the secret virtues of a land tax would be the most effectual means of preventing that cultivation they are intended to promote besides the whole country is heavily in arrear already for land taxes and quit rents they have different methods of taxation in the different provinces agreeable to their several local circumstances in new england by far the greatest part of their revenue is raised by faculty taxes and capitations such is the method in many others it is obvious that parliament unassisted by the colonies themselves cannot take so much as a single step in this mode of taxation then what tax is it he will impose why after all the boasting speeches and writings of his faction for these four years after all the vain expectations which they have held out to a deluded public this their great advocate after twisting the subject every way after writhing himself into every posture after knocking at every door is obliged fairly to abandon every mode of taxation whatsoever in america he thinks it the best method for parliament to impose the sum and reserve  then what does he get by this method on the side of acquiescence will the people of america relish this course of giving and granting and applying their money the better because their assemblies are made commissioners of the taxes this is far worse than all his former projects for here if the assemblies shall refuse or delay or be negligent or fraudulent in this newimposed duty we are wholly without remedy and neither our customhouse officers nor our troops nor our armed ships can be of the least use in the collection nothing can be a more contemptible idea i will not call it an oppressive one the harshness is lost in the folly than that of proposing to get any revenue from the americans but by their freest and most cheerful consent most monied men know their own interest right well and are as able as any financier in the valuation of risques yet i think this financier will scarcely find that adventurer hardy enough at any premium to advance a shilling upon a vote of such taxes let him name the man or set of men that would do it this is the only proof of the value of revenues what would an interested man rate them at his subscription would be at ninety nine per cent discount the very first day of its opening here is our only national security from ruin a security upon which no man in his senses would venture a shilling of his fortune yet he puts down those articles as gravely in his supply for his peace establishment as if the money had been all fairly lodged in the exchequer  l american revenue  00 000 ireland  00 000  very handsome indeed but if supply is to be got in such a manner farewell the lucrative mystery of finance if you are to be credited for savings without showing how why or with what safety they are to be made and for revenues without specifying on what articles or by what means or at what expense they are to be collected there is not a clerk in a public office who may not outbid this author or his friend for the department of chancellor of the exchequer not an apprentice in the city that will not strike out with the same advantages the same or a much larger plan of supply  here is the whole of what belongs to the authors scheme for saving us from impending destruction take it even in its most favorable point of view as a thing within possibility and imagine what must be the wisdom of this gentleman or his opinion of ours who could first think of representing this nation in such a state as no friend can look upon but with horror and scarce an enemy without compassion and afterward of diverting himself with such inadequate impracticable puerile methods for our relief if these had been the dreams of some unknown unnamed and nameless writer they would excite no alarm their weakness had been an antidote to their malignity but as they are universally believed to be written by the hand or what amounts to the same thing under the immediate direction of a person who has been in the management of the highest affairs and may soon be in the same situation i think it is not to be reckoned amongst our greatest consolations that the yet remaining power of this kingdom is to be employed in an attempt to realize notions that are at once so frivolous and so full of danger that consideration will justify me in dwelling a little longer on the difficulties of the nation and the solutions of our author  i am then persuaded that he cannot be in the least alarmed about our situation let his outcry be what he pleases i will give him a reason for my opinion which i think he cannot dispute all that he bestows upon the nation which it does not possess without him and supposing it all sure money amounts to no more than a sum of l  00000 a year this he thinks will do the business completely and render us flourishing at home and respectable abroad if the option between glory and shame if our salvation or destruction depended on this sum it is impossible that he should have been active and made a merit of that activity in taking off a shilling in the pound of the land tax which came up to his grand desideratum and upwards of l  00000 more by this maneuver he left our trade navigation and manufactures on the verge of destruction our finances in ruin our credit expiring ireland on the point of being ceded to france the colonies of being torn to pieces the succession of the crown at the mercy of our great rival and the kingdom itself on the very point of becoming tributary to that haughty power all this for want of l  00000 for i defy the reader to point out any other revenue or any other precise and defined scheme of politics which he assigns for our redemption  i know that two things may be said in his defense as bad reasons are always at hand in an indifferent cause that he was not sure the money would be applied as he thinks it ought to be by the present ministers i think as ill of them as he does to the full they have done very near as much mischief as they can do to a constitution so robust as this nothing can make them more dangerous but that as they are already in general composed of his disciples and instruments they may add to the public calamity of their own measures the adoption of his projects but be the ministers what they may the author knows that they could not avoid applying this l   0000 to the service of the establishment as faithfully as he or any other minister could do i say they could not avoid it and have no merit at all for the application but supposing that they should greatly mismanage this revenue here is a good deal of room for mistake and prodigality before you come to the edge of ruin the difference between the amount of that real and his imaginary revenue is l   0000 a year at least a tolerable sum for them to play with and this in one article might compensate the difference between the authors economy and their profusion and still notwithstanding their vices and ignorance the nation might be saved the author ought also to recollect that a good man would hardly deny even to the worst of ministers the means of doing their duty especially in a crisis when our being depended on supplying them with some means or other in such a case their penury of mind in discovering resources would make it rather the more necessary not to strip such poor providers of the little stock they had in hand  besides here is another subject of distress and a very serious one which puts us again to a stand the author may possibly not come into power i only state the possibility he may not always continue in it and if the contrary to all this should fortunately for us happen what insurance on his life can be made for a sum adequate to his loss then we are thus unluckily situated that the chance of an american and irish revenue of l  00000 to be managed by him is to save us from ruin two or three years hence at best to make us happy at home and glorious abroad and the actual possession of l   0000 english taxes cannot so much as protract our ruin without him propria haec si dona fuissent so we are staked on four chances his power its permanence the success of his projects and the duration of his life any one of these failing we are gone this is no unfair representation ultimately all hangs on his life because in his account of every set of men that have held or supported administration he finds neither virtue or ability in any but himself indeed he pays through their measures some compliments to lord bute and lord despenser but to the latter this is i suppose but a civility to old acquaintance to the former a little stroke of politics we may therefore fairly say that our only hope is his life and he has to make it the more so taken care to cut off any resource which we possessed independent of him  in the next place it may be said to excuse any appearance of inconsistency between the authors actions and his declarations that he thought it right to relieve the landed interest and lay the burden where it ought to lie on the colonies what to take off a revenue so necessary to our being before any thing whatsoever was acquired in the place of it in prudence he ought to have waited at least for the first quarters receipt of the new anonymous american revenue and irish land tax is there something so specific for our disorders in american and something so poisonous in english money that one is to heal the other to destroy us to say that the landed interest could not continue to pay it for a year or two longer is more than the author will attempt to prove to say that they would pay it no longer is to treat the landed interest in my opinion very scurvily to suppose that the gentry clergy and freeholders of england do not rate the commerce the credit the religion the liberty the independency of their country and the succession of their crown at a shilling in the pound land tax they never gave him reason to think so meanly of them and if i am rightly informed when that measure was debated in parliament a very different reason was assigned by the authors great friend as well as by others for that reduction one very different from the critical and almost desperate state of our finances some people then endeavored to prove that the reduction might be made without detriment to the national credit or the due support of a proper peace establishment otherwise it is obvious that the reduction could not be defended in argument so that this author cannot despair so much of the commonwealth without this american and irish revenue as he pretends to do if he does the reader sees how handsomely he has provided for us by voting away one revenue and by giving us a pamphlet on the other  i do not mean to blame the relief which was then given by parliament to the land it was grounded on very weighty reasons the administration contended only for its continuance for a year in order to have the merit of taking off the shilling in the pound immediately before the elections and thus to bribe the freeholders of england with their own money  it is true the author in his estimate of ways and means takes credit for l  00 000 a year indian revenue but he will not very positively insist that we should put this revenue to the account of his plans or his power and for a pretty plain reason we are already near two years in possession of it by what means we came to that possession is a pretty long story however i shall give nothing more than a short abstract of the proceeding in order to see whether the author will take to himself any part in that measure  the fact is this the east india company had for a good while solicited the ministry for a negotiation by which they proposed to pay largely for some advantages in their trade and for the renewal of their charter this had been the former method of transacting with that body government having only leased the monopoly for short terms the company has been obliged to resort to it frequently for renewals these two parties had always negotiated on the true principle of credit not as government and subject but as equal dealers on the footing of mutual advantage the public had derived great benefit from such dealing but at that time new ideas prevailed the ministry instead of listening to the proposals of that company chose to set up a claim of the crown to their possessions the original plan seems to have been to get the house of commons to compliment the crown with a sort of juridical declaration of a title to the companys acquisitions in india which the crown on its part with the best air in the world was to bestow upon the public then it would come to the turn of the house of commons again to be liberal and grateful to the crown the civil list debts were to be paid off with perhaps a pretty augmentation of income all this was to be done on the most publicspirited principles and with a politeness and mutual interchange of good offices that could not but have charmed but what was best of all these civilities were to be without a farthing of charge to either of the kind and obliging parties  the east india company was to be covered with infamy and disgrace and at the same time was to pay the whole bill  in consequence of this scheme the terrors of a parliamentary enquiry were hung over them a judicature was asserted in parliament to try this question but lest this judicial character should chance to inspire certain stubborn ideas of law and right it was argued that the judicature was arbitrary and ought not to determine by the rules of law but by their opinion of policy and expediency nothing exceeded the violence of some of the managers except their impotence they were bewildered by their passions and by their want of knowledge or want of consideration of the subject the more they advanced the further they found themselves from their object  all things ran into confusion the ministers quarrelled among themselves they disclaimed one another they suspended violence and shrunk from treaty the inquiry was almost at its last gasp when some active persons of the company were given to understand that this hostile proceeding was only set up in in terrorem that government was far from an intention of seizing upon the possessions of the company administration they said was sensible that the idea was in every light full of absurdity and that such a seizure was not more out of their power than remote from their wishes and therefore if the company would come in a liberal manner to the house they certainly could not fail of putting a speedy end to this disagreeable business and of opening the way to an advantageous treaty  on this hint the company acted they came at once to a resolution of getting rid of the difficulties which arose from the complication of their trade with their revenue a step which despoiled them of their best defensive armor and put them at once into the power of administration they threw their whole stock of every kind the revenues the trade and even their debt from government into one fund which they computed on the surest grounds would amount to l  00000 with a large probable surplus for the payment of debt then they agreed to divide this sum in equal portions between themselves and the public l  00000 to each this gave to the proprietors of that fund an annual augmentation of no more than l  0000 dividend they ought to receive from government l   0000 for the loan of their capital so that in fact the whole which on this plan they reserved to themselves from their vast revenues from their extensive trade and in consideration of the great risques and mighty expenses which purchased these advantages amounted to no more than l   0000 whilst government was to receive as i said l  00000  this proposal was thought by themselves liberal indeed and they expected the highest applauses for it however their reception was very different from their expectations when they brought up their plan to the house of commons the offer as it was natural of l  00000 was very well relished but nothing could be more disgustful than the l  0000 which the company had divided amongst themselves a violent tempest of public indignation and fury rose against them the heads of people turned the company was held well able to pay l  00000 a year to government but bankrupts if they attempted to divide the fifth part of it among themselves an ex post facto law was brought in with great precipitation for annulling this dividend in the bill was inserted a clause which suspended for about a year the right which under the public faith the company enjoyed of making their own dividends such was the disposition and temper of the house that although the plain face of facts reason arithmetic all the authority parts and eloquence in the kingdom were against this bill though all the chancellors of the exchequer who had held that office from the beginning of this reign opposed it yet a few placemen of the subordinate departments sprung out of their ranks took the lead and by an opinion of some sort of secret support carried the bill with an high hand leaving the then secretary of state and the chancellor of the exchequer in a very moderate minority in this distracted situation the managers of the bill notwithstanding their triumph did not venture to propose the payment of the civil list debt the chancellor of the exchequer was not in good humor enough after his late defeat by his own troops to cooperate in such a design so they made an act to lock up the money in the exchequer until they should have time to look about them and settle among themselves what they are to do with it  thus ended this unparalleled transaction the author i believe will not claim any part of the glory of it he will leave it whole and entire to the authors of the measure the money was the voluntary free gift of the company the rescinding bill was the act of legislature to which they and we owe submission the author has nothing to do with the one or with the other however he cannot avoid rubbing himself against this subject merely for the pleasure of stirring controversies and gratifying a certain pruriency of taxation that seems to infect his blood it is merely to indulge himself in speculations of taxing that he chooses to harangue on this subject for he takes credit for no greater sum than the public is already in possession of he does not hint that the company means or has ever shown any disposition if managed with common prudence to pay less in future and he cannot doubt that the present ministry are as well inclined to drive them by their mock enquiries and real rescinding bills as he can possibly be with his taxes besides it is obvious that as great a sum might have been drawn from that company without affecting property or shaking the constitution or endangering the principle of public credit or running into his golden dreams of cockets on the ganges or visions of stamp duties on perwannas dustucks kistbundees and husbulhookums for once i will disappoint him in this part of the dispute and only in a very few words recommend to his consideration how he is to get off the dangerous idea of taxing a public fund if he levies those duties in england and if he is to levy them in india what provision he has made for a revenue establishment there supposing that he undertakes this new scheme of finance independently of the company and against its inclinations  so much for the revenues which are nothing but his visions or already the national possessions without any act of his it is easy to parade with an high talk of parliamentary rights of the universality of legislative powers and of uniform taxation men of sense when new projects come before them always think a discourse proving the mere right or mere power of acting in the manner proposed to be no more than a very unpleasant way of mispending time they must see the object to be of proper magnitude to engage them they must see the means of compassing it to be next to certain the mischiefs not to counterbalance the profit they will examine how a proposed imposition or regulation agrees with the opinions of those who are likely to be affected by it they will not despise the consideration even of their habitudes and prejudices they wish to know how it accords or disagrees with the true spirit of prior establishments whether of government or of finance because they well know that in the complicated economy of great kingdoms and immense revenues which in a length of time and by a variety of accidents have coalesced into a sort of body an attempt toward a compulsory equality in all circumstances and an exact practical definition of the supreme rights in every case is the most dangerous and chimerical of all enterprises the old building stands well enough though part gothic part grecian and part chinese until an attempt is made to square it into uniformity then it may come down upon our heads all together in much uniformity of ruin and great will be the fall thereof some people instead of inclining to debate the matter only feel a sort of nausea when they are told that protection calls for supply and that all the parts ought to contribute to the support of the whole strange argument for great and grave deliberation as if the same end may not and must not be compassed according to its circumstances by a great diversity of ways thus in great britain some of our establishments are apt for the support of credit they stand therefore upon a principle of their own distinct from and in some respects contrary to the relation between prince and subject it is a new species of contract superinduced upon the old contract of the state the idea of power must as much as possible be banished from it for power and credit are things adverse incompatible non been convenient nec in una sede morantur such establishments are our great monied companies to tax them would be critical and dangerous and contradictory to the very purpose of their institution which is credit and cannot therefore be taxation but the nation when it gave up that power did not give up the advantage but supposed and with reason that government was overpaid in credit for what it seemed to lose in authority in such a case to talk of the rights of sovereignty is quite idle other establishments supply other modes of public contribution our trading companies as well as individual importers are a fit subject of a revenue by customs some establishments pay us by a monopoly of their consumption and their produce this nominally no tax in reality comprehends all taxes such establishments are our colonies to tax them would be as erroneous in policy as rigorous in equity ireland supplies us by furnishing troops in war and by bearing part of our foreign establishment in peace she aids us at all times by the money that her absentees spend amongst us which is no small part of the rental of that kingdom thus ireland contributes her part some objects bear port duties some are fitter for an inland excise the mode varies the object is the same to strain these from their old and inveterate leanings might impair the old benefit and not answer the end of the new project among all the great men of antiquity procrustes shall never be my hero of legislation with his iron bed the allegory of his government and the type of some modern policy by which the long limb was to be cut short and the short tortured into length such was this state bed of uniformity he would i conceive be a very indifferent farmer who complained that his sheep did not plough or his horses yield him wool though it would be an idea full of equality they may think this right in rustic economy who think it available in the politic  qui bavium non odit amet tua carmina maevi atque idem jungat vulpes et mulgeat hircos as the author has stated this indian taxation for no visible purpose relative to his plan of supply so he has stated many other projects with as little if any distinct end unless perhaps to show you how full he is of projects for the public good and what vast expectations may be formed of him or his friends if they should be translated into administration it is always from some opinion that these speculations may one day become our public measures that i think it worth while to trouble the reader at all about them  two of them stand out in high relievo beyond the rest the first is a change in the internal representation of this country by enlarging our number of constituents the second is an addition to our representatives by new american members of parliament i pass over here all considerations how far such a system will be an improvement of our constitution according to any sound theory not that i mean to condemn such speculative enquiries concerning this great object of the national attention they may tend to clear doubtful points and possibly may lead as they have often done to real improvements what i object to is their introduction into a discourse relating to the immediate state of our affairs and recommending plans of practical government in this view i see nothing in them but what is usual with the author an attempt to raise discontent in the people of england to balance those discontents the measures of his friends had already raised in america what other reason can he have for suggesting that we are not happy enough to enjoy a sufficient number of voters in england i believe that most sober thinkers on this subject are rather of opinion that our fault is on the other side and that it would be more in the spirit of our constitution and more agreeable to the pattern of our best laws by lessening the number to add to the weight and independency of our voters and truly considering the immense and dangerous charge of elections the prostitute and daring venality the corruption of manners the idleness and profligacy of the lower sort of voters no prudent man would propose to increase such an evil if it be as i fear it is out of our power to administer to it any remedy the author proposes nothing further if he has any improvements that may balance or may lessen this inconvenience he has thought proper to keep them as usual in his own breast since he has been so reserved i should have wished he had been as cautious with regard to the project itself first because he observes justly that his scheme however it might improve the platform can add nothing to the authority of the legislature much i fear it will have a contrary operation for authority depending on opinion at least as much as on duty an idea circulated among the people that our constitution is not so perfect as it ought to be before you are sure of mending it is a certain method of lessening it in the public opinion of this irreverent opinion of parliament the author himself complains in one part of his book and he endeavors to increase it in the other has he well considered what an immense operation any change in our constitution is how many discussions parties and passions it will necessarily excite and when you open it to enquiry in one part where the enquiry will stop experience shows us that no time can be fit for such changes but a time of general confusion when good men finding every thing already broke up think it right to take advantage of the opportunity of such derangement in favor of an useful alteration perhaps a time of the greatest security and tranquillity both at home and abroad may likewise be fit but will the author affirm this to be just such a time transferring an idea of military to civil prudence he ought to know how dangerous it is to make an alteration of your disposition in the face of an enemy  now comes his american representation here too as usual he takes no notice of any difficulty or proposes any sort of solution he throws you his politics as he does his revenue do you make something of them if you can is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an american representation from that quarter it is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement not from the necessity in the case not to add any thing to the authority of parliament but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the americans when he regulated the colonies over and over again he thought he did so when he formed two general systems of revenue one of portduties and the other of internal taxation these systems supposed or ought to suppose the greatest attention to and the most detailed information of all their affairs however by contending for the american representation he seems at last driven virtually to admit that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye and so little connected with our immediate feelings that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes until we can secure the desired representation in parliament perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it he talks of his union just as he does of his taxes and his savings with as much sang froid and ease as if his wish and the enjoyment were exactly the same thing he appears not to have troubled his head with the infinite difficulty of settling that representation on a fair balance of wealth and numbers throughout the several provinces of america and the west indies under such an infinite variety of circumstances it costs him nothing to fight with nature and to conquer the order of providence which manifestly opposes itself to the possibility of such a parliamentary union  but let us to indulge his passion for projects and power suppose the happy time arrived when the author comes into the ministry and is to realise his speculations the writs are issued for electing members for america and the west indies some provinces receive them in six weeks some in ten some in twenty a vessel may be lost and then some provinces may not receive them at all but let it be that they all receive them at once and in the shortest time a proper space must be given for proclamation and for the election some weeks at least but the members are chosen and if ships are ready to sail in about six more they arrive in london in the mean time the parliament has sat and business far advanced without american representatives nay by this time it may happen that the parliament is dissolved and then the members ship themselves again to be again elected the writs may arrive in america before the poor members of a parliament in which they never sat can arrive at their several provinces a new interest is formed and they find other members are chosen whilst they are on the high seas but if the writs and members arrive together here is at best a new trial of skill amongst the candidates after one set of them have well aired themselves with their two voyages of  000 miles  however in order to facilitate every thing to the author we will suppose them all once more elected and steering again to old england with a good heart and a fair westerly wind in their stern on their arrival they find all in a hurry and bustle in and out condolence and congratulation the crown is demised another parliament is to be called away back to america again on a fourth voyage and to a third election does the author mean to make our kings as immortal in their personal as in their politic character or whilst he bountifully adds to their life will he take from them their prerogative of dissolving parliaments in favor of the american union or are the american representatives to be perpetual and to feel neither demises of the crown nor dissolutions of parliament  but these things may be granted to him without bringing him much nearer to his point what does he think of reelection is the american member the only one who is not to take a place or the only one to be exempted from the ceremony of reelection how will this great politician preserve the rights of electors the fairness of returns and the privilege of the house of commons as the sole judge of such contests it would undoubtedly be a glorious sight to have eight or ten petitions or double returns from boston and barbados from philadelphia and jamaica the members returned and the petitioners with all their train of attorneys solicitors mayors selectmen provost marshals and about five hundred or a thousand witnesses come to the bar of the house of commonspossibly we might be interrupted in the enjoyment of this pleasing spectacle if a war should break out and our constitutional fleet loaded with members of parliament returning officers petitioners and witnesses the electors and elected should become a prize to the french or spaniards and be conveyed to carthagena or to la vera cruz and from thence perhaps to mexico or lima there to remain until a cartel for members of parliament can be settled or until the war is ended  in truth the author has little studied this business or he might have known that some of the most considerable provinces of america such for instance as connecticut and massachusetts bay have not in each of them two men who can afford at a distance from their estates to spend a thousand pounds a year how can these provinces be represented at westminster if their province pays them they are american agents with salaries and not independent members of parliament it is true that formerly in england members had salaries from their constituents but they all had salaries and were all in this way upon a par if these american representatives have no salaries then they must add to the list of our pensioners and dependants at court or they must starve there is no alternative  enough of this visionary union in which much extravagance appears without any fancy and the judgment is shocked without any thing to refresh the imagination it looks as if the author had dropped down from the moon without any knowledge of the general nature of this globe of the general nature of its inhabitants without the least acquaintance with the affairs of this country governor pownal has handled the same subject to do him justice he treats it upon far more rational principles of speculation and much more like a man of business he thinks erroneously i conceive but he does think that our legislative rights are incomplete without such a representation it is no wonder therefore that he endeavors by every means to obtain it not like our author who is always on velvet he is aware of some difficulties and he proposes some solutions but nature is too hard for both these authors and america is and ever will be without actual representation in the house of commons nor will any minister be wild enough even to propose such a representation in parliament however he may choose to throw out that project together with others equally far from his real opinions and remote from his designs merely to fall in with the different views and captivate the affections of different sorts of men  whether these projects arise from the authors real political principles or are only brought out in subservience to his political views they compose the whole of any thing that is like precise and definite which the author has given us to expect from that administration which is so much the subject of his praises and prayers as to his general propositions that there is a deal of difference between impossibilities and great difficulties that a great scheme cannot be carried unless made the business of successive administrations that virtuous and able men are the fittest to serve their country all this i look on no more than so much rubble to fill up the spaces between the regular masonry pretty much in the same light i cannot forbear considering his detached observations on commerce such as that the system for colony regulations would be very simple and mutually beneficial to great britain and her colonies if the old navigation that the transportation should be in all cases in ships belonging to british subjects that even british ships should not be generally received into the colonies from any part of europe except the dominions of great britain  that it is unreasonable that corn and such like products should be restrained to come first to a british port what do all these fine observations signify some of them condemn as ill practices things that never were practiced at all some recommend to be done things that always have been done others indeed convey though obliquely and loosely some insinuations highly dangerous to our commerce if i could prevail on myself to think the author meant to ground any practice upon these general propositions i should think it very necessary to ask a few questions about some of them for instance what does he mean by talking of an adherence to the old navigation laws does he mean that the particular law    car ii c    commonly called the act of navigation is to be adhered to and that the several subsequent additions amendments and exceptions ought to be all repealed if so he will make a strange havoc in the whole system of our trade laws which have been universally acknowledged to be full as well founded in the alterations and exceptions as the act of charles the second in the original provisions and to pursue full as wisely the great end of that very politic law the increase of the british navigation i fancy the writer could hardly propose any thing more alarming to those immediately interested in that navigation than such a repeal if he does not mean this he has got no farther than a nugatory proposition which nobody can contradict and for which no man is the wiser  that the regulations for the colony trade would be few and simple if the old navigation laws were adhered to i utterly deny as a fact that they ought to be so sounds well enough but this proposition is of the same nugatory nature with some of the former the regulations for the colony trade ought not to be more nor fewer nor more or less complex than the occasion requires and as that trade is in a great measure a system of art and restriction they can be neither few nor simple it is true that the very principle may be destroyed by multiplying to excess the means of securing it never did a minister depart more from the authors ideas of simplicity or more embarrass the trade of america with the multiplicity and intricacy of regulations and ordinances than his boasted minister of      that minister seemed to be possessed with something hardly short of a rage for regulation and restriction he had so multiplied bonds certificates affidavits warrants sufferances and cockets had supported them with such severe penalties and extended them without the least consideration of circumstances to so many objects that had they all continued in their original force commerce must speedily have expired under them some of them the ministry which gave them birth was obliged to destroy with their own hand they signed the condemnation of their own regulations confessing in so many words in the preamble of their act of the  th geo iii that some of these regulations had laid an unnecessary restraint on the trade and correspondence of his majestys american subjects this in that ministry was a candid confession of a mistake but every alteration made in those regulations by their successors is to be the effect of envy and american misrepresentation so much for the authors simplicity in regulation  i have now gone through all which i think immediately essential in the authors ideas of war of peace of the comparative states of england and france of our actual situation of his projects of economy of finance of commerce and of constitutional improvement there remains nothing now to be considered except his heavy censures upon the administration which was formed in      which is commonly known by the name of the marquis of rockinghams administration as the administration which preceded it is by that of mr grenville these censures relate chiefly to three heads   to the repeal of the american stamp act   to the commercial regulations then made   to the course of foreign negotiations during that short period  a person who knew nothing of public affairs but from the writings of this author would be led to conclude that at the time of the change in june      some welldigested system of administration founded in national strength and in the affections of the people proceeding in all points with the most reverential and tender regard to the laws and pursuing with equal wisdom and success every thing which could tend to the internal prosperity and to the external honor and dignity of this country had been all at once subverted by an irruption of a sort of wild licentious unprincipled invaders who wantonly and with a barbarous rage had defaced a thousand fair monuments of the constitutional and political skill of their predecessors it is natural indeed that this author should have some dislike to the administration which was formed in      its views in most things were different from those of his friends in some altogether opposite to them it is impossible that both of these administrations should be the objects of public esteem their different principles compose some of the strongest political lines which discriminate the parties even now subsisting amongst us the ministers of      are not indeed followed by very many in their opposition yet a large part of the people now in office entertain or pretend to entertain sentiments entirely conformable to theirs whilst some of the former colleagues of the ministry which was formed in      however they may have abandoned the connection and contradicted by their conduct the principles of their former friends pretend on their parts still to adhere to the same maxims all the lesser divisions which are indeed rather names of personal attachment than of party distinction fall in with the one or the other of these leading parties  i intend to state as shortly as i am able the general condition of public affairs and the disposition of the minds of men at the time of the remarkable change of system in      the reader will have thereby a more distinct view of the comparative merits of these several plans and will receive more satisfaction concerning the ground and reason of the measures which were then pursued than i believe can be derived from the perusal of those partial representations contained in the state of the nation and the other writings of those who have continued for now near three years in the undisturbed possession of the press this will i hope be some apology for my dwelling a little on this part of the subject  on the resignation of the earl of bute in      our affairs had been delivered into the hands of three ministers of his recommendation mr grenville the earl of egremont and the earl of halifax this arrangement notwithstanding the retirement of lord bute announced to the public a continuance of the same measures nor was there more reason to expect a change from the death of the earl of egremont the earl of sandwich supplied his place the duke of bedford and the gentlemen who act in that connection and whose general character and politics were sufficiently understood added to the strength of the ministry without making any alteration in their plan of conduct such was the constitution of the ministry which was changed in       as to their politics the principles of the peace of paris governed in foreign affairs in domestic the same scheme prevailed of contradicting the opinions and disgracing most of the persons who had been countenanced and employed in the late reign the inclinations of the people were little attended to and a disposition to the use of forcible methods ran through the whole tenor of administration the nation in general was uneasy and dissatisfied sober men saw causes for it in the constitution of the ministry and the conduct of the ministers the ministers who have usually a short method on such occasions attributed their unpopularity wholly to the efforts of faction however this might be the licentiousness and tumults of the common people and the contempt of government of which our author so often and so bitterly complains as owing to the mismanagement of the subsequent administrations had at no time risen to a greater or a more dangerous height the measures taken to suppress that spirit were as violent and licentious as the spirit itself injudicious precipitate and some of them illegal instead of allaying they tended infinitely to inflame the distemper and whoever will be at the least pains to examine will find those measures not only the causes of the tumults which then prevailed but the real sources of almost all the disorders which have arisen since that time more intent on making a victim to party than an example of justice they blundered in the method of pursuing their vengeance by this means a discovery was made of many practices common indeed in the office of secretary of state but wholly repugnant to our laws and the genius of the english constitution one of the worst of these was the wanton and indiscriminate seizure of papers even in cases where the safety of the state was not pretended in justification of so harsh a proceeding the temper of the ministry had excited a jealousy which made the people more than commonly vigilant concerning every power which was exercised by government the abuse however sanctioned by custom was evident but the ministry instead of resting in a prudent inactivity or what would have been still more prudent taking the lead in quieting the minds of the people and ascertaining the law upon those delicate points made use of the whole influence of government to prevent a parliamentary resolution against the practices of office and lest the colorable reasons offered in argument against this parliamentary procedure should be mistaken for the real motives of their conduct all the advantage of privilege all the arts and finesses of pleading and great sums of public money were lavished to prevent any decision upon those practices in the courts of justice in the mean time in order to weaken since they could not immediately destroy the liberty of the press the privilege of parliament was voted away in all accusations for a seditious libel the freedom of debate in parliament itself was no less menaced officers of the army of long and meritorious service and of small fortunes were chosen as victims for a single vote by an exertion of ministerial power which had been very rarely used and which is extremely unjust as depriving men not only of a place but a profession and is indeed of the most pernicious example both in a civil and a military light  whilst all things were managed at home with such a spirit of disorderly despotism abroad there was a proportionable abatement of all spirit some of our most just and valuable claims were in a manner abandoned this indeed seemed not very inconsistent conduct in the ministers who had made the treaty of paris with regard to our domestic affairs there was no want of industry but there was a great deficiency of temper and judgment and manly comprehension of the public interest the nation certainly wanted relief and government attempted to administer it two ways were principally chosen for this great purpose the first by regulation the second by new funds of revenue agreeably to this plan a new naval establishment was formed at a good deal of expense and to little effect to aid in the collection of the customs regulation was added to regulation and the strictest and most unreserved orders were given for a prevention of all contraband trade here and in every part of america a teazing customhouse and a multiplicity of perplexing regulations ever have and ever will appear the masterpiece of finance to people of narrow views as a paper against smuggling and the importation of french finery never fails of furnishing a very popular column in a newspaper  the greatest part of these regulations were made for america and they fell so indiscriminately on all sorts of contraband or supposed contraband that some of the most valuable branches of trade were driven violently from our ports which caused an universal consternation throughout the colonies every part of the trade was infinitely distressed by them men of war now for the first time armed with regular commissions of customhouse officers invested the coasts and gave to the collection of revenue the air of hostile contribution about the same time that these regulations seemed to threaten the destruction of the only trade from whence the plantations derived any specie an act was made putting a stop to the future emission of paper currency which used to supply its place among them hand in hand with this went another act for obliging the colonies to provide quarters for soldiers instantly followed another law for levying throughout all america new port duties upon a vast variety of commodities of their consumption and some of which lay heavy upon objects necessary for their trade and fishery immediately upon heels of these and amidst the uneasiness and confusion produced by a crowd of new impositions and regulations some good some evil some doubtful all crude and illconsidered came another act for imposing an universal stampduty on the colonies and this was declared to be little more than an experiment and a foundation of future revenue to render these proceedings the more irritating to the colonies the principal argument used in favor of their ability to pay such duties was the liberality of the grants of their assemblies during the late war never could any argument be more insulting and mortifying to a people habituated to the granting of their own money  taxes for the purpose of raising revenue had hitherto been sparingly attempted in america without ever doubting the extent of its lawful power parliament always doubted the propriety of such impositions and the americans on their part never thought of contesting a right by which they were so little affected their assemblies in the main answered all the purposes necessary to the internal economy of a free people and provided for all the exigences of government which arose amongst themselves in the midst of that happy enjoyment they never thought of critically settling the exact limits of a power which was necessary to their union their safety their equality and even their liberty thus the two very difficult points superiority in the presiding state and freedom in the subordinate were on the whole sufficiently that is practically reconciled without agitating those vexatious questions which in truth rather belong to metaphysics than politics and which can never be moved without shaking the foundations of the best governments that have ever been constituted by human wisdom by this measure was let loose that dangerous spirit of disquisition not in the coolness of philosophical enquiry but enflamed with all the passions of an haughty resentful people who thought themselves deeply injured and that they were contending for every thing that was valuable in the world  in england our ministers went on without the least attention to these alarming dispositions just as if they were doing the most common things in the most usual way and among a people not only passive but pleased they took no one step to divert the dangerous spirit which began even then to appear in the colonies to compromise with it to mollify it or to subdue it no new arrangements were made in civil government no new powers or instructions were given to governors no augmentation was made or new disposition of forces never was so critical a measure pursued with so little provision against its necessary consequences as if all common prudence had abandoned the ministers and as if they meant to plunge themselves and us headlong into that gulf which stood gaping before them by giving a years notice of the project of their stamp act they allowed time for all the discontents of that country to fester and come to a head and for all the arrangements which factious men could make toward an opposition to the law at the same time they carefully concealed from the eye of parliament those remonstrances which they had actually received and which in the strongest manner indicated the discontent of some of the colonies and the consequences which might be expected they concealed them even in defiance of an order of council that they should be laid before parliament thus by concealing the true state of the case they rendered the wisdom of the nation as improvident as their own temerity either in preventing or guarding against the mischief it has indeed from the beginning to this hour been the uniform policy of this set of men in order at any hazard to obtain a present credit to propose whatever might be pleasing as attended with no difficulty and afterward to throw all the disappointment of the wild expectations they had raised upon those who have the hard task of freeing the public from the consequences of their pernicious projects  whilst the commerce and tranquillity of the whole empire were shaken in this manner our affairs grew still more distracted by the internal dissentions of our ministers treachery and ingratitude was charged from one side despotism and tyranny from the other the vertigo of the regency bill the awkward reception of the silk bill in the house of commons and the inconsiderate and abrupt rejection of it in the house of lords the strange and violent tumults which arose in consequence and which were rendered more serious by being charged by the ministers upon one another the report of a gross and brutal treatment of the  by a ministry at the same time odious to the people all conspired to leave the public at the close of the session of      in as critical and perilous a situation as ever the nation was or could be in a time when she was not immediately threatened by her neighbors  it was at this time and in these circumstances that a new administration was formed professing even industriously in this public matter to avoid anecdotes i say nothing of those famous reconciliations and quarrels which weakened the body that should have been the natural support of this administration i run no risque in affirming that surrounded as they were with difficulties of every species nothing but the strongest and most incorrupt sense of their duty to the public could have prevailed upon some of the persons who composed it to undertake the kings business at such a time their preceding character their measures while in power and the subsequent conduct of many of them i think leave no room to charge this assertion to flattery having undertaken the commonwealth what remained for them to do to piece their conduct upon the broken chain of former measures if they had been so inclined the ruinous nature of those measures which began instantly to appear would not have permitted it scarcely had they entered into office when letters arrived from all parts of america making loud complaints backed by strong reasons against several of the principal regulations of the late ministry as threatening destruction to many valuable branches of commerce these were attended with representations from many merchants and capital manufacturers at home who had all their interests involved in the support of lawful trade and in the suppression of every sort of contraband whilst these things were under consideration that conflagration blazed out at once in north america an universal disobedience and open resistance to the stamp act and in consequence an universal stop to the course of justice and to trade and navigation throughout that great important country an interval during which the trading interest of england lay under the most dreadful anxiety which it ever felt  the repeal of that act was proposed it was much too serious a measure and attended with too many difficulties upon every side for the then ministry to have undertaken it as some paltry writers have asserted from envy and dislike to their predecessors in office as little could it be owing to personal cowardice and dread of consequences to themselves ministers timorous from their attachment to place and power will fear more from the consequences of one court intrigue than from a thousand difficulties to the commerce and credit of their country by disturbances at three thousand miles distance from which of these the ministers had most to apprehend at that time is known i presume universally nor did they take that resolution from a want of the fullest sense of the inconveniences which must necessarily attend a measure of concession from the sovereign to the subject that it must increase the insolence of the mutinous spirits in america was but too obvious no great measure indeed at a very difficult crisis can be pursued which is not attended with some mischief none but conceited pretenders in public business will hold any other language and none but weak and unexperienced men will believe them if they should if we were found in such a crisis let those whose bold designs and whose defective arrangements brought us into it answer for the consequences the business of the then ministry evidently was to take such steps not as the wishes of our author or as their own wishes dictated but as the bad situation in which their predecessors had left them absolutely required  the disobedience to this act was universal throughout america nothing it was evident but the sending a very strong military backed by a very strong naval force would reduce the seditious to obedience to send it to one town would not be sufficient every province of america must be traversed and must be subdued i do not entertain the least doubt but this could be done we might i think without much difficulty have destroyed our colonies this destruction might be effected probably in a year or in two at the utmost if the question was upon a foreign nation where every successful stroke adds to your own power and takes from that of a rival a just war with such a certain superiority would be undoubtedly an advisable measure but four million of debt due to our merchants the total cessation of a trade annually worth four million more a large foreign traffic much home manufacture a very capital immediate revenue arising from colony imports indeed the produce of every one of our revenues greatly depending on this trade all these were very weighty accumulated considerations at least well to be weighed before that sword was drawn which even by its victories must produce all the evil effects of the greatest national defeat how public credit must have suffered i need not say if the condition of the nation at the close of our foreign war was what this author represents it such a civil war would have been a bad couch on which to repose our wearied virtue far from being able to have entered into new plans of economy we must have launched into a new sea i fear a boundless sea of expense such an addition of debt with such a diminution of revenue and trade would have left us in no want of a state of the nation to aggravate the picture of our distresses  our trade felt this to its vitals and our then ministers were not ashamed to say that they sympathised with the feelings of our merchants the universal alarm of the whole trading body of england will never be laughed at by them as an illgrounded or a pretended panick the universal desire of that body will always have great weight with them in every consideration connected with commerce neither ought the opinion of that body to be slighted notwithstanding the contemptuous and indecent language of this author and his associates in any consideration whatsoever of revenue nothing amongst us is more quickly or deeply affected by taxes of any kind than trade and if an american tax was a real relief to england no part of the community would be sooner or more materially relieved by it than our merchants but they well know that the trade of england must be more burdened by one penny raised in america than by three in england and if that penny be raised with the uneasiness the discontent and the confusion of america more than by ten  if the opinion and wish of the landed interest is a motive and it is a fair and just one for taking away a real and a large revenue the desire of the trading interest of england ought to be a just ground for taking away a tax of little better than speculation which was to be collected by a war which was to be kept up with the perpetual discontent of those who were to be affected by it and the value of whose produce even after the ordinary charges of collection was very uncertain it is observable that the partisans of american taxation when they have a mind to represent this tax as wonderfully beneficial to england state it as worth l  00000 a year when they are to represent it as very light on the americans it dwindles to l  0000 indeed it is very difficult to compute what its produce might have been  after the extraordinary the dearest purchased revenue that ever was made by any nation  these were some of the motives drawn from principles of convenience for that repeal when the object came to be more narrowly inspected every motive concurred these colonies were evidently founded in subservience to the commerce of great britain from this principle the whole system of our laws concerning them became a system of restriction a double monopoly was established on the part of the parent country   a monopoly of their whole import which is to be altogether from great britain   a monopoly of all their export which is to be no where but to great britain as far as it can serve any purpose here on the same idea it was contrived that they should send all their products to us raw and in their first state and that they should take every thing from us in the last stage of manufacture  were ever a people under such circumstances that is a people who were to export raw and to receive manufactured and this not a few luxurious articles but all articles even to those of the grossest most vulgar and necessary consumption a people who were in the hands of a general monopolist were ever such a people suspected of a possibility of becoming a just object of revenue all the ends of their foundation must be supposed utterly contradicted before they could become such an object every tradelaw we have made must have been eluded and become useless before they could be in such a condition  the partisans of the new system who on most occasions take credit for full as much knowledge as they possess think proper on this occasion to counterfeit an extraordinary degree of ignorance and in consequence of it to assert that the balance between the colonies and great britain consid p    is unknown and that no important conclusion can be drawn from premises so very uncertain now to what can this ignorance be owing were the navigation laws made that this balance should be unknown is it from the course of exchange that it is unknown which all the world knows to be greatly and perpetually against the colonies is it from the doubtful nature of the trade we carry on with the colonies are not these schemists well apprized that the colonists particularly those of the northern provinces import more from great britain ten times more than they send in return to us that a great part of their foreign balance is and must be remitted to london i shall be ready to admit that the colonies ought to be taxed to the revenues of this country when i know that they are out of debt to its commerce this author will furnish some ground to his theories and communicate a discovery to the public if he can show this by any medium but he tells us that their seas are covered consid p    with ships and their rivers floating with commerce this is still true but it is with our ships that they are covered and they float with british commerce the american merchants are our factors all in reality most even in name they trade they navigate they cultivate with english capitals to their own advantage to be sure for without these capitals their ploughs would be stopped and their ships windbound but he who employs the capital must on the whole be the person principally benefited the person who works upon it profits on his part too but he profits in a subordinate way as our colonies do that is as the servant of a wise and indulgent master and no otherwise we have all except the peculium without which even slaves will not labor  if the authors principles which are the common notions be right that the price of our manufactures is so greatly enhanced by our taxes then the americans already pay in that way a share of our impositions he is not ashamed to assert that france and china may be said on the consid p    same principle to bear a part of our charges for they consume our commodities was ever such a method of reasoning heard of do not the laws absolutely confine the colonies to buy from us whether foreign nations sell cheaper or not on what other idea are all our prohibitions regulations guards penalties and forfeitures framed to secure to us not a commercial preference which stands in need of no penalties to enforce it it finds its own way but to secure to us a trade which is a creature of law and institution what has this to do with the principles of a foreign trade which is under no monopoly and in which we cannot raise the price of our goods without hazarding the demand for them none but the authors of such measures could ever think of making use of such arguments  whoever goes about to reason on any part of the policy of this country with regard to america upon the mere abstract principles of government or even upon those of our own ancient constitution will be often misled those who resort for arguments to the most respectable authorities ancient or modern or rest upon the clearest maxims drawn from the experience of other states and empires will be liable to the greatest errors imaginable the object is wholly new in the world it is singular it is grown up to this magnitude and importance within the memory of man nothing in history is parallel to it all the reasonings about it that are likely to be at all solid must be drawn from its actual circumstances in this new system a principle of commerce of artificial commerce must predominate this commerce must be secured by a multitude of restraints very alien from the spirit of liberty and a powerful authority must reside in the principal state in order to enforce them but the people who are to be the objects of these restraints are descendants of englishmen and of an high and free spirit to hold over them a government made up of nothing but restraints and penalties and taxes in the granting of which they can have no share will neither be wise nor long practicable people must be governed in a manner agreeable to their temper and disposition and men of free character and spirit must be ruled with at least some condescension to this spirit and this character the british colonist must see something which will distinguish him from the colonists of other nations those reasonings which infer from the many restraints under which we have already laid america to our right to lay it under still more and indeed under all manner of restraints are conclusive conclusive as to right but the very reverse as to policy and practice we ought rather to infer from our having laid the colonies under many restraints that it is reasonable to compensate them by every indulgence that can by any means be reconciled to our interest we have a great empire to rule composed of a vast mass of heterogeneous governments all more or less free and popular in their forms all to be kept in peace and kept out of conspiracy with one another all to be held in subordination to this country while the spirit of an extensive and intricate trading interest pervades the whole always qualifying and often controlling every general idea of constitution and government it is a great and difficult object and i wish we may possess wisdom and temper enough to govern it as we ought its importance is infinite i believe the reader will be struck as i have been with one singular fact in the year   0  but sixtyfive years ago the whole trade with our plantations was but a few thousand pounds more in the export article and a third less in the import than that which we now carry on with the single island of jamaica exports imports total english plantations in   0                jamaica                      from the same information i find that our dealing with most of the european nations is but little increased these nations have been pretty much at a stand since that time and we have rivals in their trade this colony intercourse is a new world of commerce in a manner created it stands upon principles of its own principles hardly worth endangering for any little consideration of extorted revenue  the reader sees that i do not enter so fully into this matter as obviously i might i have already been led into greater lengths than i intended it is enough to say that before the ministers of      had determined to propose the repeal of the stamp act in parliament they had the whole of the american constitution and commerce very fully before them they considered maturely they decided with wisdom let me add with firmness for they resolved as a preliminary to that repeal to assert in the fullest and least equivocal terms the unlimited legislative right of this country over its colonies and having done this to propose the repeal on principles not of constitutional right but on those of expediency of equity of lenity and of the true interests present and future of that great object for which alone the colonies were founded navigation and commerce this plan i say required an uncommon degree of firmness when we consider that some of those persons who might be of the greatest use in promoting the repeal violently withstood the declaratory act and they who agreed with administration in the principles of that law equally made as well the reasons on which the declaratory act itself stood as those on which it was opposed grounds for an opposition to the repeal  if the then ministry resolved first to declare the right it was not from any opinion they entertained of its future use in regular taxation their opinions were full and declared against the ordinary use of such a power but it was plain that the general reasonings which were employed against that power went directly to our whole legislative right and one part of it could not be yielded to such arguments without a virtual surrender of all the rest besides if that very specific power of levying money in the colonies were not retained as a sacred trust in the hands of great britain to be used not in the first instance for supply but in the last exigence for control it is obvious that the presiding authority of great britain as the head the arbiter and director of the whole empire would vanish into an empty name without operation or energy with the habitual exercise of such a power in the ordinary course of supply no trace of freedom could remain to america i do not here enter into the unsatisfactory disquisition concerning representation real or presumed i only say that a great people who have their property without any reserve in all cases disposed of by another people at an immense distance from them will not think themselves in the enjoyment of freedom it will be hard to show to those who are in such a state which of the usual parts of the definition or description of a free people are applicable to them and it is neither pleasant nor wise to attempt to prove that they have no right to be comprehended in such a description  if great britain were stripped of this right every principle of unity and subordination in the empire was gone for ever whether all this can be reconciled in legal speculation is a matter of no consequence it is reconciled in policy and politics ought to be adjusted not to human reasonings but to human nature of which the reason is but a part and by no means the greatest part  founding the repeal on this basis it was judged proper to lay before parliament the whole detail of the american affairs as fully as it had been laid before the ministry themselves ignorance of those affairs had misled parliament knowledge alone could bring it into the right road every paper of office was laid upon the table of the two houses every denomination of men either of america or connected with it by office by residence by commerce by interest even by injury men of civil and military capacity officers of the revenue merchants manufacturers of every species and from every town in england attended at the bar such evidence never was laid before parliament if an emulation arose among the ministers and members of parliament as the author rightly observes for the repeal of this act as well as for the other regulations it was not on the confident assertions the airy speculations  our author is very much displeased that so much credit was given to the testimony of merchants he has an habit of railing at them and he may if he pleases indulge himself in it it will not do great mischief to that respectable set of men the substance of their testimony was that their debts in america were very great that the americans declined to pay them or to renew their orders whilst this act continued that under these circumstances they despaired of the recovery of their debts or the renewal of their trade in that country that they apprehended a general failure of mercantile credit the manufacturers deposed to the same general purpose with this addition that many of them had discharged several of their artificers and if the law and the resistance to it should continue must dismiss them all  this testimony is treated with great contempt by our author it must be i suppose because it was contradicted by the plain nature of things suppose then that the merchants had to gratify this author given a contrary evidence and had deposed that while america remained in a state of resistance whilst four million of debt remained unpaid whilst the course of justice was suspended for want of stamped paper so that no debt could be recovered whilst there was a total stop to trade because every ship was subject to seizure for want of stamped clearances and while the colonies were to be declared in rebellion and subdued by armed force that in these circumstances they would still continue to trade cheerfully and fearlessly as before would not such witnesses provoke universal indignation for their folly or their wickedness and be deservedly hooted from the bar here the author has a note altogether in his usual strain of reasoning he finds out that somebody in the course of this multifarious evidence had said that a very considerable part of the orders of      transmitted from america had been afterward suspended but that in case the stamp act was repealed those orders were to be executed in the present year      and that on the repeal of the stamp act the exports to the colonies would be at least double the value of the exports of the past year he then triumphs exceedingly on their having fallen short of it on the state of the customhouse entries i do not know well what conclusion he draws applicable to his purpose from these facts he does not deny that all the orders which came from america subsequent to the disturbances of the stamp act were on the condition of that act being repealed and he does not assert that notwithstanding that act should be enforced by a strong hand still the orders would be executed neither does he quite venture to say that this decline of the trade in      was owing to the repeal what does he therefore infer from it favorable to the enforcement of that law it only comes to this and no more those merchants who thought our trade would be doubled in the subsequent year were mistaken in their speculations so that the stamp act was not to be repealed unless this speculation of theirs was a probable event but it was not repealed in order to double our trade in that year as every body knows whatever some merchants might have said but lest in that year we should have no trade at all the fact is that during the greatest part of the year      that is until about the month of october when the accounts of the disturbances came thick upon us the american trade went on as usual before this time the stamp act could not affect it afterward the merchants fell into a great consternation a general stagnation in trade ensued but as soon as it was known that the ministry favored the repeal of the stamp act several of the bolder merchants ventured to execute their orders others more timid hung back in this manner the trade continued in a state of dreadful fluctuation beween the fears of those who had ventured for the event of their boldness and the anxiety of those whose trade was suspended until the royal assent was finally given to the bill of repeal that the trade of      was not equal to that of      could not be owing to the repeal it arose from quite different causes of which the author seems not to be aware  st our conquests during the war had laid open the trade of the french and spanish west indies to north america much more largely than she had ever enjoyed it this continued for some time after the peace but at length it was extremely contracted and in some places reduced to nothing such in particular was the state of jamaica on the taking the havannah all their stores were emptied into that place which produced unusual orders for goods for supplying their own consumption as well as for further speculations of trade these ceasing the trade stood on its own bottom this is one cause of the diminished  would any human faith have given credit to such assertions the testimony of the merchants was necessary for the detail and to bring the matter home to the feeling of the house as to the general reasons they spoke abundantly for themselves  upon these principles was the act repealed and it produced all the good effect which was expected from it quiet was restored trade generally returned to its ancient channels time and means were furnished for the better strengthening of government there as well as for recovering by judicious measures the affections of the people had that ministry continued or had a ministry succeeded with dispositions to improve that opportunity  such an administration did not succeed instead of profiting of that season of tranquillity in the very next year they chose to return to measures of the very same nature with those which had been so solemnly condemned though upon a smaller scale the effects have been correspondent america is again in disorder not indeed in the same degree as formerly nor any thing like it such good effects have attended the repeal of the stamp act that the colonies have actually paid the taxes and they have sought their redress upon however improper principles not in their own violence as formerly the disturbances have been in boston only and were not in consequence of the late duties  but in the experienced benignity of parliament they are not easy indeed nor ever will be so under this authors schemes of taxation but we see no longer the same general fury and confusion which attended their resistance to the stamp act the author may rail at the repeal and those who proposed it as he pleases those honest men suffer all his obloquy with pleasure in the midst of the quiet which they have been the means of giving to their country and would think his praises for their perseverance in a pernicious scheme a very bad compensation for the disturbance of our peace and the ruin of our commerce whether the return to the system of      for raising a revenue in america the discontents which have ensued in consequence of it the general suspension of the assemblies in consequence of these discontents the use of the military power and the new and dangerous commissions which now hang over them will produce equally good effects is greatly to be doubted never i fear will this nation and the colonies fall back upon their true center of gravity and natural point of repose until the ideas of      are resumed and steadily pursued  as to the regulations a great subject of the authors accusation they are of two sorts one of a mixed nature of revenue and trade the other simply relative to trade with regard to the former i shall observe that in all deliberations concerning america the ideas of that administration were principally these to take trade as the primary object and revenue but as a very subordinate consideration where the trade was likely to suffer they did not hesitate for an instant to prefer it to taxes whose produce at best was contemptible in comparison of the object which they might endanger the other of their principles was to suit the revenue to the object where the difficulty of collection from the nature of the country and of the revenue establishment is so very notorious it was their policy to hold out as few temptations to smuggling as possible by keeping the duties as nearly as they could on a balance with the risque on these principles they made many alterations in the port duties of      both in the mode and in the quantity the author has not attempted to prove them erroneous he complains enough to show that he is in an ill humor not that his adversaries have done amiss  as to the regulations which were merely relative to commerce many were then made and they were all made upon this principle that many of the colonies and those some of the most abounding in people were so situated as to have very few means of traffic with this country it became therefore our object to let them into as much foreign trade as could be given them without interfering with our own and to secure by every method the returns to the mother country without some such scheme of enlargement it was obvious that any benefit we could expect from these colonies must be extremely limited accordingly many facilities were given to their trade with the foreign plantations and with the southern parts of europe as to the confining the returns to this country administration saw the mischief and folly of a plan of indiscriminate restraint they applied their remedy to that part where the disease existed and to that only on this idea they established regulations far more likely to check the dangerous clandestine trade with hamburgh and holland than this authors friends or any of their predecessors had ever done  the friends of the author have a method surely a little whimsical in all this sort of discussions they have made an innumerable multitude of commercial regulations at which the trade of england exclaimed with one voice and many of which have been altered on the unanimous opinion of that trade still they go on just as before in a sort of droning panegyric on themselves talking of these regulations as prodigies of wisdom and instead of appealing to those who are most affected and the best judges they turn round in a perpetual circle of their own reasonings and pretenses they hand you over from one of their own pamphlets to another see say they this demonstrated in the regulations of the colonies see this satisfactorily proved in the considerations by and by we shall have another see for this the state of the nation i wish to take another method in vindicating the opposite system i refer to the petitions of merchants for these regulations to their thanks when they were obtained and to the strong and grateful sense they have ever since expressed of the benefits received under that administration  all administrations have in their commercial regulations been generally aided by the opinion of some merchants too frequently by that of a few and those a sort of favorites they have been directed by the opinion of one or two merchants who were to merit in flatteries and to be paid in contracts who frequently advised not for the general good of trade but for their private advantage during the administration of which this author complains the meeting of merchants upon the business of trade were numerous and public sometimes at the house of the marquis of rockingham sometimes at mr dowdeswells sometimes at sir george saviles an house always open to every deliberation favorable to the liberty or the commerce of his country nor were these meetings confined to the merchants of london merchants and manufacturers were invited from all the considerable towns of england they conferred with the ministers and active members of parliament no private views no local interests prevailed never were points in trade settled upon a larger scale of information they who attended these meetings well know what ministers they were who heard the most patiently who comprehended the most clearly and who provided the most wisely let then this author and his friends still continue in possession of the practice of exalting their own abilities in their pamphlets and in the newspapers they never will persuade the public that the merchants of england were in a general confederacy to sacrifice their own interests to those of north america and to destroy the vent of their own goods in favor of the manufactures of france and holland  had the friends of this author taken these means of information his extreme terrors of contraband in the west india islands would have been greatly quieted and his objections to the opening of the ports would have ceased he would have learned from the most satisfactory analysis of the west india trade that we have the advantage in every essential article of it and that almost every restriction on our communication with our neighbors there is a restriction unfavourable to ourselves  such were the principles that guided and the authority which sanctioned these regulations no man ever said that in the multiplicity of regulations made in the administration of their predecessors none were useful some certainly were so and i defy the author to show a commercial regulation of that period which he can prove from any authority except his own to have a tendency beneficial to commerce that has been repealed so far were that ministry from being guided by a spirit of contradiction or of innovation  the authors attack on that administration for their neglect of our claims on foreign powers is by much the most astonishing instance he has given or that i believe any man ever did give of an intrepid effrontery it relates to the manilla ransom to the canada bills and to the russian treaty could one imagine that these very things which he thus chooses to object to others have been the principal subjects of charge against his favorite ministry instead of clearing them of these charges he appears not so much as to have heard of them but throws them directly upon the administration which succeeded to that of his friends  it is not always very pleasant to be obliged to produce the detail of this kind of transactions to the public view i will content myself therefore with giving a short state of facts which when the author chooses to contradict he shall see proved more perhaps to his conviction than to his liking the first fact then is that the demand for the manilla ransom had been in the authors favorite administration so neglected as to appear to have been little less than tacitly abandoned at home no countenance was given to the claimants and when it was mentioned in parliament the then leader did not seem at least a very sanguine advocate in favor of the claim these things made it a matter of no small difficulty to resume and press that negotiation with spain however so clear was our right that the then ministers resolved to revive it and so little time was lost that though that administration was not completed until the ninth of july      on the  0th of the following august general conway transmitted a strong and full remonstrance on that subject to the earl of rochfort the argument on which the court of madrid most relied was the dereliction of that claim by the preceding ministers however it was still pushed with so much vigor that the spaniards from a positive denial to pay offered to refer the demand to arbitration that proposition was rejected and the demand being still pressed there was all the reason in the world to expect its being brought to a favorable issue when it was thought proper to change the administration whether under their circumstances and in the time they continued in power more could be done the reader will judge who will hear with astonishment a charge of remissness from those very men whose inactivity to call it by no worse a name laid the chief difficulties in the way of the revived negotiation  as to the canada bills this author thinks proper to assert that the when i know that the earl of halifax says this the earl of halifax shall have an answer but i persuade myself that his lordship has given no authority for this ridiculous rant in the mean time i shall only speak of it as a common concern of that ministry  in the first place then i observe that a convention for the liquidation of the canada bills was concluded under the administration of      when nothing was concluded under that of the favorites of this author    this transaction was in every step of it carried on in concert with the persons interested and was terminated to their entire satisfaction they would have acquiesced perhaps in terms somewhat lower than those which were obtained the author is indeed too kind to them he will however let them speak for themselves and show what their own opinion was of the measures pursued in their favor they are happy in having sound in your zeal for the dignity of this nation the means of liquidating their claims and of concluding with the court of france a convention for the final satisfaction of their demands and have given us commission in their names and on their behalf most earnestly to entreat your acceptance of their grateful acknowledgments  whether they consider themselves as britons or as men more particularly profiting by your generous and spirited interposition they see great reasons to be thankful for having been supported by a minister in whose public affections in whose wisdom and activity both the national honor and the interests of individuals have been at once so well supported and secured thanks of the canada merchants to general conway london april            in what manner the execution of the convention has been since provided for it is not my present business to examine    the proprietors had absolutely despaired of being paid at any time any proportion of their demand until the change of that ministry the merchants were checked and discountenanced they had often been told by some in authority of the cheap rate at which these canada bills had been procured yet the author can talk of the composition of them as a necessity induced by the change in administration they found themselves indeed before that change under a necessity of hinting somewhat of bringing the matter into parliament but they were soon silenced and put in mind of the fate which the newfoundland business had there met with nothing struck them more than the strong contrast between the spirit and method of proceeding of the two administrations    the earl of halifax never did nor could refuse to sign this convention because this convention as it stands never was before him see the convention itself printed by owen and harisson warwick lane      particularly the articles   and      the authors last charge on that ministry with regard to foreign affairs is the russian treaty of commerce which the author thinks fit to assert was concluded on terms the earl of buckinghamshire had refused to  both the assertions in this paragraph are equally groundless the treaty then concluded by sir george macartney was not on the terms which the earl of buckinghamshire had refused the earl of buckinghamshire never did refuse terms because the business never came to the point of refusal or acceptance all that he did was to receive the russian project for a treaty of commerce and to transmit it to england this was in november      and he left petersburgh the january following before he could even receive an answer from his own court the conclusion of the treaty fell to his successor whoever will be at the trouble to compare it with the treaty of      will i believe confess that if the former ministers could have obtained such terms they were criminal in not accepting them  but the merchants deemed them unsafe and unprofitable what merchants as no treaty ever was more maturely considered so the opinion of the russian merchants in london was all along taken and all the instructions sent over were in exact conformity to that opinion our minister there made no step without having previously consulted our merchants resident in petersburgh who before the signing the treaty gave the most full and unanimous testimony in its favor in their address to our minister at that court among other things they say it may afford some additional satisfaction to your excellency to receive a public acknowledgment of the entire and unreserved approbation of every article in this treaty from us who are so immediately and so nearly concerned in its consequences this was signed by the consul general and every british merchant in petersburgh  the approbation of those immediately concerned in the consequences is nothing to this author he and his friends have so much tenderness for peoples interests and understand them so much better than they do themselves that whilst these politicians are contending for the best of possible terms the claimants are obliged to go without any terms at all  one of the first and justest complaints against the administration of the authors friends was the want of vigor in their foreign negotiations their immediate successors endeavored to correct that error along with others and there was scarcely a foreign court in which the new spirit that had arisen was not sensibly felt acknowledged and sometimes complained of on their coming into administration they found the demolition of dunkirk entirely at a stand instead of demolition they found construction for the french were then at work on the repair of the jettees on the remonstrances of general conway some parts of these jettees were immediately destroyed the duke of richmond personally surveyed the place and obtained a fuller knowledge of its true state and condition than any of our ministers had done and in consequence had larger offers from the duke of choiseul than had ever been received but knowing these to be short of our just expectations under the treaty he rejected them our then ministers knowing that in their administration the peoples minds were set at ease upon all the essential points of public and private liberty and that no projects of theirs could endanger the concord of the empire were under no restraint from pursuing every just demand upon foreign nations  the author toward the end of this work falls into reflections upon the state of public morals in this country he draws use from his doctrine by recommending his friend to the king and the public as another duke of sully and he concludes the whole performance with a very devout prayer the prayers of politicians may sometimes be sincere and as this prayer is in substance that the author or his friends may be soon brought into power i have great reason to believe it is very much from the heart however after he has drawn such a picture such a shocking picture of the state of this country he has great faith in thinking the means he prays for sufficient to relieve us after the character he has given of its inhabitants of all ranks and classes he has great charity in caring much about them and indeed no less hope in being of opinion that such a detestable nation can ever become the care of providence he has not even found five good men in our devoted city  he talks indeed of men of virtue and ability but where are his men of virtue and ability to be found are they in the present administration never were a set of people more blackened by this author are they among the party of those no small body who adhere to the system of      these it is the great purpose of this book to calumniate are they the persons who acted with his great friend since the change in      to his removal in      scarcely any of these are now out of employment and we are in possession of his desideratum yet i think he hardly means to select even some of the highest of them as examples fit for the reformation of a corrupt world  he observes that the virtue of the most exemplary prince that ever swayed a scepter can never warm or illuminate the body of his people if foul mirrours are placed so near him as to refract and dissipate the rays at their first emanation without observing upon the propriety of this allusion or asking how mirrours come to have lost their old quality of reflecting and to have acquired that of refracting and dissipating rays and how far their foulness will account for this change the remark itself is common and true no less true and equally surprising from him is that which immediately precedes it it is in vain to endeavor to check the one individual if others equally culpable are rewarded with the honors and emoluments of the state i am not in the secret of the authors manner of writing but it appears to me that he must intend these reflections as a satire upon the administration of his happy years were ever the favors and emoluments of the state more lavishly squandered upon persons scandalous in their lives than during that period in these scandalous lives was there any thing more scandalous than the mode of punishing one culpable individual in that individual is any thing more culpable than his having been seduced by the example of some of those very persons by whom he was thus persecuted  the author is so eager to attack others that he provides but indifferently for his own defense i believe without going beyond the page i have now before me he is very sensible that i have sufficient matter of further and if possible of heavier charge against his friends upon his own principles but it is because the advantage is too great that i decline making use of it i wish the author had not thought that all methods are lawful in party above all he ought to have taken care not to wound his enemies through the sides of his country this he has done by making that monstrous and overcharged picture of the distresses of our situation no wonder that he who finds this country in the same condition with that of france at the time of henry the fourth could also find a resemblance between his political friend and the duke of sully as to those personal resemblances people will often judge of them from their affections they may image in these clouds whatsoever figures they please but what is the conformation of that eye which can discover a resemblance of this country and these times to those with which the author compares them france a country just recovered out of twentyfive years of the most cruel and desolating civil war that perhaps was ever known the kingdom under a veil of momentary quiet full of the most atrocious political operating upon the most furious fanatical factions some pretenders even to the crown and those who did not pretend to the whole aimed at the partition of the monarchy there were almost as many competitors as provinces and all abetted by the greatest the most ambitious and most enterprizing power in europe no place safe from treason no not the bosoms on which the most amiable prince that ever lived reposed his head not his mistresses not even his queen as to the finances they had scarce an existence but as a matter of plunder to the managers and of grants to insatiable and ungrateful courtiers  how can our author have the heart to describe this as any sort of parallel to our situation to be sure an april shower has some resemblance to a water spout for they are both wet and there is some likeness between a summer evenings breeze and an hurricane they are both wind but who can compare our disturbances our situation or our finances to those of france great britain is indeed at this time wearied but not broken with the efforts of a victorious foreign war not sufficiently relieved by an inadequate peace but somewhat benefited by that peace and infinitely by the consequences of that war the powers of europe awed by our victories and lying in ruins upon every side of us burdened indeed we are with debt but abounding with resources we have a trade not perhaps equal to our wishes but more than ever we possessed in effect no pretender to the crown nor nutriment for such desperate and destructive factions as have formerly shaken this kingdom  as to our finances the author trifles with us when sully came to those of france in what order was any part of the financial system or what system was there at all there is no man in office who must not be sensible that ours is without the act of any parading minister the most regular and orderly system perhaps that was ever known the best secured against all frauds in the collection and all misapplication in the expenditure of public money  i admit that in this flourishing state of things there are appearances enough to excite uneasiness and apprehension i admit there is a cankerworm in the rose  medio de font leporum surgit amari aliquid quod in ipsis floribus angat this is nothing else than a spirit of disconnection of distrust and of treachery amongst public men it is no accidental evil nor has its effect been trusted to the usual frailty of nature the distemper has been inoculated the author is sensible of it and we lament it together this distemper is alone sufficient to take away considerably from the benefits of our constitution and situation and perhaps to render their continuance precarious if these evil dispositions should spread much farther they must end in our destruction for nothing can save a people destitute of public and private faith however the author for the present state of things has extended the charge by much too widely as men are but too apt to take the measure of all mankind from their own particular acquaintance barren as this age may be in the growth of honor and virtue the country does not want at this moment as strong and those not a few examples as were ever known of an unshaken adherence to principle and attachment to connection against every allurement of interest those examples are not furnished by the great alone nor by those whose activity in public affairs may render it suspected that they make such a character one of the rounds in their ladder of ambition but by men more quiet and more in the shade on whom an unmixed sense of honor alone could operate such examples indeed are not furnished in great abundance amongst those who are the subjects of the authors panegyric he must look for them in another camp he who complains of the ill effects of a divided and heterogeneous administration is not justifiable in laboring to render odious in the eyes of the public those men whose principles whose maxims of policy and whose personal character can alone administer a remedy to this capital evil of the age neither is he consistent with himself in constantly extolling those whom he knows to be the authors of the very mischief of which he complains and which the whole nation feels so deeply  the persons who are the objects of his dislike and complaint are many of them of the first families and weightiest properties in the kingdom but infinitely more distinguished for their untainted honor public and private and their zealous but sober attachment to the constitution of their country than they can be by any birth or any station if they are the friends of any one great man rather than another it is not that they make his aggrandisement the end of their union or because they know him to be the most active in caballing for his connexions the largest and speediest emoluments it is because they know him by personal experience to have wise and enlarged ideas of the public good and an invincible constancy in adhering to it because they are convinced by the whole tenor of his conduct that he will never negotiate away their honor or his own and that in or out of power change of situation will make no alteration in his conduct this will give to such a person in such a body an authority and respect that no minister ever enjoyed among his venal dependants in the highest plenitude of his power such as servility never can give such as ambition never can receive or relish  this body will often be reproached by their adversaries for want of ability in their political transactions they will be ridiculed for missing many favorable conjunctures and not profiting of several brilliant opportunities of fortune but they must be contented to endure that reproach for they cannot acquire the reputation of that kind of ability without losing all the other reputation they possess  they will be charged too with a dangerous spirit of exclusion and proscription for being unwilling to mix in schemes of administration which have no bond of union or principle of confidence that charge too they must suffer with patience if the reason of the thing had not spoken loudly enough the miserable examples of the several administrations constructed upon the idea of systematic discord would be enough to frighten them from such monstrous and ruinous conjunctions it is however false that the idea of an united administration carries with it that of a proscription of any other party it does indeed imply the necessity of having the great strong holds of government in wellunited hands in order to fecure the predominance of right and uniform principles of having the capital offices of deliberation and execution in those who can deliberate with mutual confidence and who will execute what is resolved with firmness and fidelity if this system cannot be rigorously adhered to in practice and what system can be so it ought to be the constant aim of good men to approach as nearly to it as possible no system of that kind can be formed which will not leave room fully sufficient for healing coalitions but no coalition which under the specious name of independency carries in its bosom the unreconciled principles of the original discord of parties ever was or will be an healing coalition nor will the mind of our sovereign ever know repose his kingdom settlement or his business order efficiency or grace with his people until things are established upon the basis of some set of men who are trusted by the public and who can trust one another  this comes rather nearer to the mark than the authors description of a proper administration under the name of men of ability and virtue which conveys no definite idea at all nor does it apply specifically to our grand national distemper all parties pretend to these qualities the present ministry no favorites of the author will be ready enough to declare themselves persons of virtue and ability and if they choose a vote for that purpose perhaps it would not be quite impossible for them to procure it but if the disease be this distrust and disconnection it is easy to know who are sound and who are tainted who are fit to restore us to health who to continue and to spread the contagion the present ministry being made up of draughts from all parties in the kingdom if they should prosess any adherence to the connexions they have left they must convict themselves of the brackest treachery they therefore choose rather to renounce the principle itself and to brand it with the name of pride and faction this test with certainty discriminates the opinions of men the other is a description vague and unsatisfactory  as to the unfortunate gentlemen who may at any time compose that system which under the plausible title of an administration subsists but for the establishment of weakness and confusion they fall into different classes with different merits i think the situation of some people in that state may deserve a certain degree of compassion at the same time that they furnish an example which it is to be hoped by being a severe one will have its effect at least on the growing generation if an original seduction on plausible but hollow pretenses into loss of honor friendship consistency security and repose can furnish it it is possible to draw even from the very prosperity of ambition examples of terror and motives to compassion  i believe the instances are exceedingly rare of mens immediately passing over a clear marked line of virtue into declared vice and corruption there are a sort of middle tints and shades between the two extremes there is something uncertain on the confines of the two empires which they first pass through and which renders the change easy and imperceptible there are even a sort of splendid impositions so well contrived that at the very time the path of rectitude is quitted for ever men seem to be advancing into some higher and nobler road of public conduct not that such impositions are strong enough in themselves but a powerful interest often concealed from those whom it affects works at the bottom and secures the operation men are thus debauched away from those legitimate connections which they had formed on a judgment early perhaps but sufficiently mature and wholly unbiassed they do not quit them upon any ground of complaint for grounds of just complaint may exist but upon the flattering and most dangerous of all principles that of mending what is well gradually they are habituated to other company and a change in their habitudes soon makes a way for a change in their opinions certain persons are no longer so very frightful when they come to be known and to be serviceable as to their old friends the transition is easy from friendship to civility from civility to enmity few are the steps from dereliction to persecution  people not very well grounded in the principles of public morality find a set of maxims in office ready made for them which they assume as naturally and inevitably as any of the insignia or instruments of the situation a certain tone of the solid and practical is immediately acquired every former profession of public spirit is to be considered as a debauch of youth or at best as a visionary scheme of unattainable perfection the very idea of consistency is exploded the convenience of the business of the day is to furnish the principle for doing it then the whole ministerial cant is quickly got by heart the prevalence of faction is to be lamented all opposition is to be regarded as the effect of discontent all administrations are declared to be alike the same necessity justifies all their measures it is no longer a matter of discussion who or what administration is but administration is to be supported as a general maxim flattering themselves that their power is become necessary to the support of all order and government every thing which tends to the support of that power is sanctified and becomes a part of the public interest  growing every day more formed to affairs and better knit in their limbs when the occasion now the only rule requires it they bebecome capable of sacrificing those very persons to whom they had before sacrificed their original friends it is now only in the ordinary course of business to alter an opinion or to betray a connection frequently relinquishing one set of men and adopting another they grow into a total indifference to human feeling as they had before to moral obligation until at length no one original impression remains upon their minds every principle is obliterated every sentiment effaced  in the mean time that power which all these changes aimed at securing remains still as tottering and as uncertain as ever they are delivered up into the hands of those who feel neither respect for their persons nor gratitude for their favors who are put about them in appearance to serve in reality to govern them and when the signal is given to abandon and destroy them in order to set up some newer dupe of ambition who in his turn is to be abandoned and destroyed thus living in a state of continual uneasiness and ferment softened only by the miserable consolation of giving now and then preferments to those for whom they have no value they are unhappy in their situation and find it impossible to resign it until at length soured in temper and disappointed by the very attainment of their ends in some angry in some haughty or some negligent moment they incur the displeasure of those upon whom they have rendered their very being dependent then perierunt tempora longi servitii they are cast off with scorn they are turned out emptied of all natural character of all intrinsic worth of all essential dignity and deprived of every consolation of friendship having rendered all retreat to old principles ridiculous and to old regards impracticable not being able to counterfeit pleasure or to discharge discontent nothing being sincere or right or balanced in their minds it is more than a chance that in the delirium of the last stage of their distempered power they make an insane political testament by which they throw all their remaining weight and consequence into the scale of their declared enemies and the avowed authors of their destruction thus they finish their course had it been possible that the whole or even a great part of these effects on their minds i say nothing of the effect upon their fortunes could have appeared to them in their first departure from the right line it is certain they would have rejected every temptation with horror the principle of these remarks like every good principle in morality is trite but its frequent application is not the less necessary  as to others who are plain practical men they have been guiltless at all times of all public pretense neither the author nor any one else has reason to be angry with them they belonged to his friend for their interest for their interest they quitted him and when it is their interest he may depend upon it they will return to their former connection such people subsist at all times and though the nuisance of all are at no time a worthy subject of discussion it is false virtue and plausible error that do the mischief  if men come to government with right dispositions they have not that unfavourable subject which this author represents to work upon our circumstances are indeed critical but then they are the critical circumstances of a strong and mighty nation if corruption and meanness are greatly spread they are not spread universally many public men are hitherto examples of public spirit and integrity whole parties as far as large bodies can be uniform have preserved character however they may be deceived in some particulars i know of no set of men amongst us which does not contain persons on whom the nation in a difficult exigence may well value itself private life which is the nursery of the commonwealth is yet in general pure and on the whole disposed to virtue and the people at large want neither generosity nor spirit no small part of that very luxury which is so much the subject of the authors declamation but which in most parts of life by being well balanced and diffused is only decency and convenience has perhaps as many or more good than evil consequences attending it it certainly excites industry nourishes emulation and inspires some sense of personal value into all ranks of people what we want is to establish more fully an opinion of uniformity and consistency of character in the leading men of the state such as will restore some confidence to profession and appearance such as will fix subordination upon esteem without this all schemes are begun at the wrong end all who join in them are liable to their consequences all men who under whatever pretext take a part in the formation or the support of systems constructed in such a manner as must in their nature disable them from the execution of their duty have made themselves guilty of all the present distraction and of the future ruin which they may bring upon their country  it is a serious affair this studied disunion in government in cases where union is most consulted in the constitution of a ministry and where persons are best disposed to promote it differences from the various ideas of men will arise and from their passions will often ferment into violent heats so as greatly to disorder all public business what must be the consequence when the very distemper is made the basis of the constitution and the original weakness of human nature is still further enfeebled by art and contrivance it must subvert government from the very foundation it turns our public councils into the most mischievous cabals where the consideration is not how the nations business shall be carried on but how those who ought to carry it on shall circumvent each other in such a state of things no order uniformity dignity or effect can appear in our proceedings either at home or abroad nor will it make much difference whether some of the constituent parts of such an administration are men of virtue or ability or not supposing it possible that such men with their eyes open should choose to make a part in such a body  the effects of all human contrivances are in the hand of providence i do not like to answer as our author so readily does for the event of any speculation but sure the nature of our disorders if any thing must indicate the proper remedy men who act steadily on the principles i have stated may in all events be very serviceable to their country in one case by furnishing if their sovereign should be so advised an administration formed upon ideas very different from those which have for some time been unfortunately fashionable but if this should not be the case they may be still serviceable for the example of a large body of men steadily sacrificing ambition to principle can never be without use it will certainly be prolific and draw others to an imitation vera gloria radices agit atque etiam propagatur  i do not think myself of consequence enough to imitate my author in troubling the world with the prayers or wishes i may form for the public full as little am i disposed to imitate his professions those professions are long since worn out in the political service if the work will not speak for the author his own declarations deserve but little credit  appendix so much misplaced industry has been used by the author of the state of the nation as well as by other writers to infuse discontent into the people on account of the late war and of the effects of our national debt that nothing ought to be omitted which may tend to disabuse the public upon these subjects when i had gone through the foregoing sheets i recollected that in my pages    and  0 i only gave the comparative states of the duties collected by the excise at large together with the quantities of strong beer brewed in the two periods which are there compared it might be still thought that some other articles of popular consumption of general convenience and connected with our manufactures might possibly have declined i therefore now think it right to lay before the reader the state of the produce of three capital duties on such articles duties which have frequently been made the subject of popular complaint the duty on candles that on soap paper etc and that on hides  l average produce duty on soap etc for   years ending          0  average of ditto for   years ending             average increase l       average of net produce of duty on candles for   years ending             average of ditto for   years ending             average increase l   0   average net produce of duty on hides   years ending             ditto   years ending          00 average increase l   0    this increase has not arisen from any additional duties none have been imposed on these articles during the war notwithstanding the burdens of the war and the late dearness of provisions the consumption of all these articles has increased and the revenue along with it  there is another point in the state of the nation to which i fear i have not been as full in my answer as i ought to have been and as i am well warranted to be the author has endeavored to throw a suspicion or something more on that salutary and indeed necessary measure of opening the ports in jamaica orders were given says he in august he then observes that the exports to jamaica fell l  0 0  short of those of      and that the exports of the succeeding year      fell short of those of      about eighty pounds from whence he wisely infers that this decline of exports being since the relaxation of the laws of trade there is a just ground of suspicion that the colonies have been supplied with foreign commodities instead of british  here as usual with him the author builds on a fact which is absolutely false and which being so renders his whole hypothesis absurd and impossible he asserts that the order for admitting spanish vessels was given in august      that order was not signed at the treasury board until the   th day of the november following and therefore so far from affecting the exports of the year      that supposing all possible diligence in the commissioners of the customs in expediting that order and every advantage of vessels ready to fail and the most favorable wind it would hardly even arrive in jamaica within the limits of that year  this order could therefore by no possibility be a cause of the decrease of exports in      if it had any mischievous operation it could not be before      in that year according to our author the exports sell short of the preceding just eighty pounds he is welcome to that diminution and to all the consequences he can draw from it  but as an auxiliary to account for this dreadful loss he brings in the freeport act which he observes for his convenience to have been made in spring      but for his convenience likewise he forgets that by the express provision of the act the regulation was not to be in force in jamaica until the november following miraculous must be the activity of that contraband whose operation in america could before the end of that year have reacted upon england and checked the exportation from hence unless he chooses to suppose that the merchants at whose solicitation this act had been obtained were so frighted at the accomplishment of their own most earnest and anxious desire that before any good or evil effect from it could happen they immediately put a stop to all further exportation  it is obvious that we must look for the true effect of that act at the time of its first possible operation that is in the year      on this idea how stands the account  l      exports to jamaica                                     first year of the freeport act         this author for the sake of a present momentary credit will hazard any future and permanent disgrace at the time he wrote the account of      could not be made up this was the very first year of the trial of the freeport act and we find that the sale of british commodities is so far from lessened by that act that the export of      amounts to l   000 more than that of either of the two preceding years and is l   000 above that of his standard year      if i could prevail on myself to argue in favor of a great commercial scheme from the appearance of things in a single year i should from this increase of export infer the beneficial effects of that measure in truth it is not wanting nothing but the thickest ignorance of the jamaica trade could have made any one entertain a fancy that the least ill effect on our commerce could follow from this opening of the ports but if the author argues the effect of regulations in the american trade from the export of the year in which they are made or even of the following why did he not apply this rule to his own he had the same paper before him which i have now before me he must have seen that in his standard year the year      the principal year of his new regulations the export fell no less than l      0 short of that in      did the export trade revive by these regulations in      during which year they continued in their full force it fell about l  0000 still lower here is a fall of l     000 to account for which would have become the author much better than piddling for an l  0 fall in the year      the only year in which the order he objects to could operate or in presuming a fall of exports from a regulation which took place only in november      whose effects could not appear until the following year and which when they do appear utterly overthrow all his slimsy reasons and affected suspicions upon the effect of opening the ports  this author in the same paragraph says that it was asserted by the american factors and agents that the commanders of our ships of war and tenders having customhouse commissions and the strict orders given in      for a due execution of the laws of trade in the colonies had deterred the spaniards from trading with us that the sale of british manufactures in the west indies had been greatly lessened and the receipt of large sums in specie prevented  if the american factors and agents asserted this they had good ground for their assertion they knew that the spanish vessels had been driven from our ports the author does not positively deny the fact if he should it will be proved when the factors connected this measure and its natural consequences with an actual fall in the exports to jamaica to no less an amount than l      0 in one year and with a further fall in the next is their assertion very wonderful the author himself is full as much alarmed by a fall of only l  0000 for giving him the facts which he chooses to coin it is no more the expulsion of the spanish vessels must certainly have been one cause if not of the first declension of the exports yet of their continuance in their reduced state other causes had their operation without doubt in what degree each cause produced its effect it is hard to determine but the fact of a fall of exports upon the restraining plan and of a rise upon the taking place of the enlarging plan is established beyond all contradiction  this author says that the facts relative to the spanish trade were asserted by american factors and agents insinuating that the ministry of      had no better authority for their plan of enlargement than such assertions the moment he chooses it he shall see the very same thing asserted by governors of provinces by commanders of men of war and by officers of the customs persons the most bound in duty to prevent contraband and the most interested in the seizures to be made in consequence of strict regulation i suppress them for the present wishing that the author may not drive me to a more full discussion of this matter than it may be altogether prudent to enter into i wish he had not made any of these discussions necessary  finis errata page   l   from the bottom r reduced
