and his own the enemy having observed him sit down upon the ground while he was writing notes of what he had observed sent into a field opposite to him two fieldpieces concealed in their center and had orders to drop the cannon unperceived behind a hedge as they marched along these guns were deliberately aimed at his horses and when he mounted were discharged the balls killed several of his followers and one of them wounded himself in the shoulder a shout from the irish camp rent the skies a report that he was killed instantly flew through ireland and in an incredible short space of time

let each who hears it catching patriot fire prize above all by slavish interest won the blessing to be proved thy undegenerate son queen mary to king william during his campaign in ireland    0  a poetical epistle  advertisement the following poem was written several years ago and arose from the recent publication of the queens original and most interesing letters which sir john dalrymple inserted in the appendix to his memoirs of great britain the number of these letters amounts to thirtyseven they exhibit the character of this admirable woman in the most affecting point of view and fully justify all the praise that has been given to the tenderness of her heart and the dignity of her mind the poem which is but a kind of echo to her genuine sentiments had been thrown aside with many other verses which the author has kept in privacy from the fear of trespassing too frequently on the indulgence of the public but he has been induced to print it with the preceding stanzas from the idea that it may find favor in the sight of those who love to dwell at this particular season on the great characters which it attempts to delineate  queen mary to king william once more relieved by midnights welcome hour from all the busy train of anxious power my soul o william from their bondage free joys in that freedom and is flown to thee like the poor martyr in religions cause who if the hand of persecution pause with love devout with warmth of prayer intense strains every thought and each recovering sense humbly to ask new spirit from his god to bear each future pang of tortures rod to thee i bend my succor and my pride whose love sustains me and whose counsels guide while war that turns from hence his tide of blood bears thy great spirit on his swelling flood eager to end regardless of thy life the wasting storm of sanguinary strife while compassed round with growing fears i stand the trembling guardian of this troubled land while robbed of thee whose animating sight turns doubt to joy and terror to delight i feel instead of thy protecting care fear for thy life  the worst of fears to bear  o may thy letters ministers of peace bid my vain terror for thy safety cease o let them frequent fraught with love impart thy noble spirit to this weaker heart which yet too conscious of its failing power strains every nerve in each oppressive hour to keep thy precious estimation still eager to find and happy to fulfill since from that source alone my pleasures spring the dearest wishes of my distant king in these hard scenes o give me to rejoice in the kind sanction of thy partial voice o grant my soul its honest pride to raise on the strong basis of my williams praise from that alone my little strength i draw thy smile my glory and thy will my law think how this bosom at thy signet glows which i in agony of haste unclose how to thy letter my fond eyes i glue till tears of transport intercept their view then to my heart those vital lines are pressed which breathe new being through my fainting breast in which thy soul from human fears refined the brightest copy of the almighty mind yet kindly melts with reconciling care in generous pity of the load i bear alas the burden of the unbalancd state sinks my faint soul with its increasing weight it is hard to keep the helm with this frail form while men of sterner spirit dread the storm too weak this trembling hand that helm to guide when smiling ocean spreads his smoothest tide think then what agony my bosom rends when the sky darkens when the storm descends when each great effort of the crew is crossed and frantic terror cries the vessels lost yet yet i mount these cruel waves above buoyed up by duty and superior love though icy terror freeze my female heart thy consort yet sustains her trying part her features yet her countrys fears beguile cast over their doubts a confidential smile bid them the firmness of this bosom share and boast of courage  which i feel not there dear native britain noble generous land proud of that rescue which thy virtue planned as yet but half redeemed i mourn thy doom to see thy glories shaken in their bloom to see proud france with fatal power suspend thy great redemption and its peaceful end while he whose saving hand thy laws proclaim whose sight is safety whose protection fame by distant slaughter from thy shores debarred must leave thy honor to so weak a guard who though her soul thy sacred rights revere is still a feeble being born to fear even those o william whom thy care assigned to sooth my terror and to shield my mind forget the weakness of my softer sex with doubts alarm me with dissensions vex and show discolored by their dark surmise tremendous prospects to these aching eyes yet think not tamely i this breast resign to fears suggestions so remote from thine no when the infernal spirit of despair would seize my heart and fix his fetters there i strive that circle from his power to free and break his baleful spells by naming thee those scenes more dreadful i recall to view in which my heros infant glory grew when trembling holland first with transport saw the stern atchievments of her young nassau i see the moment when her prostrate shore heard all in vain her guardian waters roar above those bulwarks saw her fate advance her shame her ruin in the host of france when all her sons would over the atlantic fly and bear their freedom to a brighter sky leaving those seats their fathers formed of yore in ocean buried and their name no more when thus of every human aid bereft even then thy valor said  it still was left to bid despotic desolation strike and fall with freedom on her latest dyke even then i see thee undismayed oppose the rising deluge of thy countrys foes oppressions torrent stem with nobler force and bid her flood roll backward to its source see rescued millions on thy triumph wait and hail thee savior of a sinking state while this bright image of thy rising fame warms my fond heart and animates my frame my melting soul thus pours with warmth like thine its adorations to the throne divine  thou god of justice whose sustaining power has watched my william from his natal hour o since thy mercy marked him at his birth the just avenger of the groaning earth  since thy decrees to strike the world with awe have raised him guardian of thy purest law while injured nations in thy servant blessed revive and see their wrongs by him redrest  complete thy mercies and sustain him still the glorious agent of thy gracious will and o since blessed with his connubial care it is mine the fortunes of his life to share since thy unquestionable mandates place my weakness in a scene that asks thy grace o let that grace with kind profusion flow and teach this bosom with new life to glow heal every cruel wound of nature there and bid my heart a stranger to despair while the storm rages like the frighted dove rest in the sacred ark of williams love  thus rapt in solitude in prayer retired i find that succor which my soul required peace in soft visions bids me sigh no more and brings her olivewreath unstained with gore but ah in vain these flattering visions rise for other seenes salute my waking eyes men now when sleep benignant power would shed his healing opiate on asslictions head our citizens terrific vigils keep and find that tourvilles name has murdered sleep england dishonored by her guardian fleet with shame with anger feels her bosom beat our citys growing fears by rumor nursed rise into folly into frenzy burst and frantic fancy sees her captive spires sink in the blaze of tourvilles spreading fires but fear o william in my heart gives place to keen sensations of this deep disgrace warmed in thy bosom i from thence have caught some little portion of thy glorious thought of honors spirit freedoms holy flame contempt of cowardice and scorn of shame unhappy england who have mourned in vain thy coast dishonored by this naval stain may thy white cliffs that tinge the silvry flood behold the stain effaced in gallic blood and thou proud vessel of stupendous mould emblazing ocean with thy breadth of gold thou frances naval pride imperial sun the name of tourvilles ship at that time the finest in the world  swift over thy shrouds may flames of vengeance run thy boasted bulk may english thunders rend and thy pale streamers to the deep descend may britons see while shouts of joy they raise thy gorgeous fabric in their lightnings blaze and blazing shed on their illumined shore glories more bright than it eclipsed before my bosom thus with love of england fraught my spirits mount in that ennobling thought though a just god may check our erring pride i still o william in his care confide life safety peace from this idea springs that thou art soldier to the king of kings that thy great actions make his mercies known thy fame his glory and thy cause his own  but should that god a guilty world to awe his chosen warrior from its aid withdraw should he  but hence distracting image hence nor shed thy poison on my wounded sense yet in these minutes that so slowly roll when expectation fills the busy soul and thinks each moment with our king to share conquest or ruin triumph or despair impatient doubt with stronger fear combined strikes from its center the unbalancd mind yet even these hours i labor to beguile to make suspences frozen features smile and from disquietude my heart to free by thus unfolding all that heart to thee he comes thy courier  on affections wing i fly to catch the tidings of my king  o joy o bounteous heaven o blessed hour delight that drowns expressions feeble power  great god of battles whose high will has shed this signal glory round my heros head o while thy praise in hymns of triumph sung fills the glad earth forgive my faltering tongue survey my soul accept its silent prayer and see thy mercies all engraven there  and thou my lord my life dear victor say what words my transport can to thee convey i write but tears the imperfect line destroy and every thought dissolves in floods of joy what aweful scenes what images arise in swift succession to my wondering eyes thy wound now shakes my shuddring heart with fear thy shouts of victory now strike my ear i see afflicted angels staunch thy blood i see thee plunge in boynes immortal flood i see thee lift thy leading sword on high the cruel sons of persecution fly i see the rout  but in that flying band one sacred head  o stretch thy saving hand o for thy marys sake in mercy spare  forgive this vain unnecessary prayer the weakness of that heart with pity see which recommends humanity to thee as well might man proud offspring of the dust enjoin the god of justice to be just for o my william in thy godlike breast celestial mercy is a constant guest no vain ambitious fanguinary pride no bigot fury is thy frantic guide heavens purest law and mans most sacred right lead thy mild spirit to the wasting fight like some pure seraph who by heaven enjoined to search to punish to correct mankind with sweet reluctance wields his flaming blade with pity views the waste by justice made and pleased the voice of penitence to hear drops on each wound a salutary tear such in the storm of war thy virtues shine the welfare of the world thy great design while mercy bids admiring nations own thy sword her weapon and thy heart her throne my love need only to thy thought commend one dearer life which mighty god defend for of the many lives that ask my prayer none but thy own will want thy constant care learn from thy wound  alas its terrors still through triumphs glowing bosom strike their chill from thee protecting heaven this boon i crave  from one the worst of woes thy servant save never let me see condemned to lose my all the pillar of the public safety fall condemned to weep my guardian spirit flown and wander through an empty world alone sooner much sooner let some kind disease this yielding frame with baleful fury seize these terms will reconcile my struggling breath to the dread summons of impending death perchance when all my latest pangs have ceased when this soft spirit is from earth released perchance thy guardian angel may resign the life of william to a love like mine o kindly deign so dear a charge to share and own i watch thee with a fonder care o should the allwise allgracious god decree to rend by early death this frame from thee to early death this consolation give say that i still shall in thy memory live nor there o william not even there alone o bid my fondness like thy fame be known let distant ages  if not sunk in shame ages most distant must revere thy name  let distant ages by thy virtue free my love engrafted on thy glory see preserved from time and envys hostile shock to bloom immortal on that sacred stock but heaven yet seems indulgent to bestow a lasting union on our loves below our promised meeting of dearbought delight fills my fond soul and dawns upon my sight thy foes dispersed thy fainting friends relieved all the great duties of thy sword achieved thou have no cause in distant realms to stay and wound expecting fondness by delay come then blessed victor come our dear defense while strong impatience strains our aching sense soon let me clasp in thy embraces blessed my glorious warrior to my glowing breast hang on thy lips and with delight explore thy great atchievments on iernes shore come thou prime care of the propitious sky hither on victorys rapid pinions fly fly to these arms and while from them disjoined still let this truth be present to thy mind  the allsearching spirit in no heart can see a love surpassing what i bear to thee finis
