anecdotes of painting in england with some account of the principal artists and incidental notes on other arts  collected by the late mr george virtue and now digested and published from his original mss by mr horace walpole  the second edition  le sachant anglois je crus quil malloit parler dedifices et de peintures nouvelle eloise vol i p     vol ii  printed by thomas kirgate at strawberryhill mdcclxv  anecdotes of painting etc chap i painters and other artists in the reign of james i it was well for the arts that king james had no disposition to them he let them take their own course had he felt any inclination for them he would probably have introduced as bad a taste as he did into litterature a prince who thought puns and quibbles the perfection of eloquence would have been charmed with the monkies of hemskirk and the drunken boors of ostade james loved his ease and his pleasures and hated novelties he gave himself up to hunting and hunted in the most cumbrous and inconvenient of all dresses a ruff and trowser breeches the nobility kept up the magnificence they found established by queen elizabeth in which predominated a want of taste rather than a bad one in more ancient times the mansions of the great lords were as i have mentioned before built for defense and strength rather than convenience the walls thick the windows pierced wherever it was most necessary for them to look abroad instead of being contrived for symmetry or to illuminate the chambers to that style succeeded the richness and delicacy of the gothic as this declined before the grecian taste was established space and vastness seem to have made their whole ideas of grandeur the palaces erected in the reign of elizabeth by the memorable countess of shrewsbury elizabeth of hardwicke are exactly in this style the apartments are lofty and enormous and they knew not how to furnish them pictures had they had good ones would be lost in chambers of such height tapestry their chief moveable was not commonly perfect enough to be real magnificence fretted cielings graceful mouldings of windows and painted glass the ornaments of the preceding age were fallen into disuse immense lights composed of bad glass in diamond panes cast an air of poverty on their most costly apartments that at hardwicke still preserved as it was furnished for the reception and emprisonment of the queen of scots is a curious picture of that age and style nothing can exceed the expense in the bed of state in the hangings of the same chamber and of the coverings for the tables the first is cloth of gold cloth of silver velvets of different colors lace fringes and embroidery the hangings consist of figures large as life representing the virtues and vices embroidered on grounds of white and black velvet the cloths to cast over the tables are embroidered and embossed with gold on velvets and damasks the only movables of any taste are the cabinets and tables themselves carved in oak the chimnies are wide enough for a hall or kitchen and over the arras are freezes of many feet deep with miserable relievos in stucco representing huntings there and in all the great mansions of that age is a gallery remarkable only for its extent that at hardwicke is of sixty yards  james built no palace himself those erected by the nobles in his reign are much like what i have been describing audleyinn dugdale writing after the days of inigo jones says that this house was not to be equalled by any fabric in this realm excepting hampton court there are prints of audleyinn in it is grandeur by winstanley who lived at littlebury near it where within my memory was his house remarkable for several mechanic tricks known by the name of winstanleys wonders his plates of audleyinn are extant but the prints are very scarce part of the edifice was taken down about forty years ago and a greater part with the magnificent gallery was demolished after the decease of the last earl of suffolk of that line paul vansomer tchambars sculp  one of the wonders of that age deserved little notice but for the prodigious space it covered toward the end of that monarchs reign genius was called out and appeared the magnificent temper or taste of the duke of buckingham led him to collect pictures and pointed out the study of them to prince charles rubens came over inigo jones arose and architecture broke forth in all the luster and purity of rome and athens  but before i come to that period i must clear my way by some account of the preceding artists the first painter who seems to have arrived after the accession of james was  paul vansomer  a native of antwerp the accounts of him are extremely deficient no author of the lives of painters mentioning him but carl vermander who only says that vansomer was living when he wrote and then resided with his brother bernard at amsterdam yet vansomer as a painter of portraits was a very able master the picture of the lord chamberlain william earl of pembroke half length at st jamess is an admirable portrait and a whole length at chatsworth of the first earl of devonshire in his robes though ascribed to mytens i should think was painted by the same hand mytens was much colder in his coloring and stiff in his drawing mytens improved so much in his later portraits that this character must be read with allowances and on studying more of his works i cannot determine whether the portrait at chatsworth is not painted by him as constant tradition says it was in general the portraits by vansomer and mytens when at whole length may be thus distinguished vansomer commonly placed his on a mat mytens on a carpet  both these portraits are bold and round and the chiaro scuro good the earl of devonshire is equal to the pencil of vandyck and one of the finest single figures i have seen in what year vansomer came to england we do not know certainly as early as   0  between which and    0 he did several pictures i shall mention but a few that are indubitably his from whence by comparison his manner may be known  james i at windsor behind him a view of whitehall  anne of denmark with a prospect of the west end of st pauls  the same king at hampton court armor lying by him on the ground better than the former dated       his queen in blue with a horse and dogs also at hampton court this picture is imitated in the tapestry at houghton  three ladies      at ditchley lady morton in purple another with yellow lace about her neck and a gauze scarf the third in black with a crape over her forehead  lord chancellor bacon and his brother nicholas at gorhambury  sir simon weston brother of lord treasurer portland whole length with a pike in his hand   0  aet    this piece was in the possession of the lord chief justice raymond  marquis of hamilton with the white staff at hampton court  vansomer died about the age of fortyfive and was buried at st cornelius jansen tchambars sculp  martins in the fields as appears by the register jan        paulus vansomer pictor eximius sepultus fuit in ecclesia  cornelius jansen  generally but inaccurately called johnson was according to sandrart born in london of flemish parents but virtue and the author of an essay toward an english school say it was at amsterdam where the latter asserts that he resided long the former that he came over young which considering how late he lived i should be inclined to believe if virtue did not at the same time pronounce that his earliest performances are his best so good a style of coloring was hardly formed here his pictures are easily he sometimes put this mark on his pictures  fecit distinguished by their clearness neatness and smoothness they are generally painted on board and except being a little stiff are often stronglly marked with a fair character of nature and remarkable for a lively tranquillity in the countenances his draperies are seldom but black i have two portraits by him of singular merit one of mr leneve master of the company of merchanttaylors the other of sir george villiers father of the great duke of buckingham less handsome but extremely like his son one of his hands rests on the head of a greyhound as fine as the animals of snyder  jansens first works in england are dated about      he dwelt in the blackfriars and had much business his price for a head was five broad pieces he painted too in small in oil and often copied his own works in that manner in the family of verney were the portraits of sir robert heath and his lady in both sizes at cashiobury is a large piece curious but so inferior to jansens general manner that if his name were not to it i should doubt it is being of his hand it represents arthur lord capel who was beheaded his lady and children behind them is a view of the garden at hadham at that time the chief seat of the family between the years    0 and    0 jansen lived much in kent at a small village called bridge near barhamdown and drew many portraits for gentlemen in the neighborhood particularly of the families of auger palmer hammond and bowyer one of his best works was the picture of a lady bowyer of the family of auger called for her exquisite beauty the star in the east at sherburn castle in dorsetshire is a head of elizabeth wriothesley eldest daughter of henry earl of southampton and wife of william lord spenser her head richly dressed and a picture in a blue enamelled case at her breast this picture is well colored though not equal to another at the same seat a half length of her mother elizabeth daughter of john vernon wife of earl henry her clothes are magnificent and the attire of her head singular a veil turned quite back the face and hands are colored with incomparable luster and equal to any thing this master executed there is also a half length in black satin of john digby first earl of bristol young and remarkably handsome it is ascribed to jansen but is faintly colored and evidently in the manner of vandyck whom perhaps he imitated as well as rivalled  jansens fame declined at lord pomfrets at easton was a portrait of charles i by jansen on the arrival of vandyck and the civil war breaking out cornelius at the importunity of his wife quitted england his pass is recorded in the journals of the commons  october  0      ordered that cornelius johnson picturedrawer shall have mr speakers warrant to pass beyond seas with emanuel pass george hawkins and to carry with him such pictures and colors bedding household stuff pewter and brass as belongs unto himself  he retired first to midelburg and then to amsterdam where he continued to paint and died in      sandrart p     his wifes name was elizabeth beck to whom he was married in      they had a son cornelius bred to his fathers profession which he followed in holland where he died poor being ruined by the extravagance of a second wife the son drew the duke of monmouths picture as he was on the point of sailing for his unfortunate expedition to england  a sister of cornelius jansen the elder was second wife of in the catalogue of king charless pictures is mentioned a portrait drawn by george spence of nuremberg and bought of nicasius russel p    nicasius russel or roussel of bruges jeweller to the kings james and charles the first they had many children to one of the sons born in      cornelius jansen was godfather and the widow of isaac oliver godmother theodore russel an elder son was born in      and lived nine years with his uncle cornelius jansen and afterward with vandyck whose pictures he copied very tolerably on small pannels many of them are in a private apartment at windsor at warwickcastle and in the collection of the duchess dowager of argyle russel chiefly was employed in the country in the families of the earls of essex and holland and was a lover of his ease and his bottle he was father of antony russel a painter from whom virtue received these particulars and at whose house he saw a picture of cornelius jansen his wife and son drawn by adrian hanneman who courted jansens neice but was disappointed  daniel mytens  of the hague was an admired painter in the reigns of king james and king charles he had certainly studied the works of rubens before his coming over his landscape in the back grounds of his portraits is evidently in the style of that school and some of his works have been taken for vandycks the date of his arrival is not certain probably it was in hopes of succeeding van somer but though he drew several of the court he was not formally employed as the kings painter till the reign of charles his patent is preserved in rymers foedera vol xviii p    i found the minute of the docquet warrant for this among the conway papers in these words  the office of one

at hampton court are several whole lengths of princes and princesses of the house of brunswicklunenburgh and the portrait of charles howard earl of nottingham at kensington is mytenss own head at knowle lionel cranfield earl of middlesex lord treasurer with his white staff whole length a small bell on the table has these letters d m f      it was more common for him to paint a slip of paper on his pictures inscribed only with the names or titles of the persons represented at lady elizabeth germains at drayton is a very fine whole length of henry rich earl of holland in a striped habit with a walking stick at st jamess the picture of the queen of scots at st jamess is a copy by mytens is jeffery hudson the dwarf holding a dog by a string in a landscape colored warmly and freely like snyder or rubens mytens drew the same figure in a very large picture of charles i and his queen which was in the possession of the late earl of dunmore but the single figure is much better painted the history of this diminutive personage was so remarkable that the reader will perhaps not dislike the digression  see fuller and wrights rutlandshire he was born at oakham in rutlandshire in      and about the age of seven or eight being then but eighteen inches high was retained in the service of the duke of buckingham who resided at burleigh on the hill soon after the marriage of charles i the king and queen being entertained at burleigh little jeffery was served up to table in a cold pie and presented by the duchess to the queen who kept him as her dwarf from seven years of age till thirty he never grew taller but after thirty he shot up to three feet nine inches and there fixed jeffery became a considerable part of the entertainment of the court sir william davenant wrote a poem called jeffreidos on a battle between him and a the scene is laid at dunkirk and the midwise rescues him from the fury of his antagonist turkeycock and in      was published a very small book called the new years gift presented at court from the lady parvula to the lord minimus commonly called little jeffery her majestys servant etc written by microphilus with a little print of jeffery prefixed before this period jeffery was employed on a negotiation of great importance he was sent to france to fetch a midwife for the queen and on his return with this gentlewoman and her majestys dancing master and many rich presents to the queen from her mother mary de medici he was taken by the dunkirkers it was in    0 besides the present he was bringing for the queen he lost to the value of   00 l that he had received in france on his own account from the queen mother and ladies of that court jeffery thus made of consequence grew to think himself really so he had born with little temper the teazing of the courtiers and domestics and had many squabbles with the kings gigantic porter a basrelief of this dwarfand giant is to be seen fixed in the front of a house near the end of bagniocourt on the east side of newgatestreet probably it was a sign oliver cromwell too had a porter of an enormous height whose standard is recorded by a large o on the back of the terrace at windsor almost under the window of the gallery this man went mad and prophesied in whitechapel was a sign of him taken from a print of st peter at last being provoked by mr crofts a young gentleman of family a challenge ensued and mr crofts coming to the rendezvous armed only with a squirt the little creature was so enraged that a real duel ensued and the appointment being on horseback with pistols to put them more on a level jeffery with the first fire shot his antagonist dead this happened in france whither he had attended his mistress in the troubles he was again taken prisoner by a turkish rover and sold into barbary he probably did not long remain in slavery for at the beginning of the civil war he was made a captain in the royal army and in      attended the queen to france where he remained till the restoration at last upon suspicion of his being privy to the popish plot he was taken up in      and confined in the gate house westminster where he ended his life in the sixtythird year of his age  mytens remained in great reputation till the arrival of vandyck who being appointed the kings principal painter the former in disgust asked his majestys leave to retire to his own country but the king learning the cause of his dissatisfaction treated him with much kindness and told him that he could find sufficient employment both for him and vandyck mytens consented to stay and even grew intimate it is probable with his rival for the head of in some of the first impressions the name of isaac appears in this plate instead of daniel it was corrected afterward mytens is one of those painted among the professors by that great master  whether the same jealousy operated again or real decline of business influenced him or any other cause mytens did not stay much longer in england we find none of his works here after the year    0 yet he lived many years afterward houbraken quotes a register at the hague dated in      at which time it says mytens painted part of the cieling of the town hall there the subject is truth writing history on the back of fame  these were the most considerable painters in oil in the reign of james there were undoubtedly several others of inferior rank whose names are not come down to us except two or three and of one of those i find nothing but this short note from baglione page       christophano roncalli pittore ando per la germania per la fiandra per l olanda per l inghilterra per la francia e finalmente carico d honori e di    anni fini il corso      he died at rome i should not mention such slight notices but that they may lead to farther discoveries an other was a more remarkable person especially in the subsequent reign but in a work of this nature it is impossible not to run the subjects of one chapter into those of another taking care however to distribute them as they serve best to carry on the chronologic series his name was  robert peake  the earliest mention of him that appears is in the they were in the collection of the late dr rawlinson books of the lord harrington treasurer of the chambers no       being accounts of moneys received and paid by him  item paid to robert peake picturemaker by warrant from the council october        for three several pictures made by him at the commandment of the duke of york his officers and given away and disposed of by the dukes grace twenty pounds  it does not appear whether these pictures were in oil or watercolors i should rather suppose portraits in miniature of king charles the first then duke of york but that peake painted in oil is ascertained peter oliver  pinx tchambars sculp  by peacham in his book of limning where he expressly celebrates his good friend mr peake and mr marquis of this man i find no other mention for oilcolours peacham himself was a limner as he tells us in the same book having presented a copy of his majestys basilicon doron illuminated to prince henry  peake was originally a pictureseller by holbournbridge and had the honor of being faithorns master and what perhaps he thought a greater honor was knighted at oxford march         the disorders of the times confounding all professions and no profession being more bound in gratitude to take up arms in the defense of king charles sir robert peake entered into the service and was made a lieutenant colonel and had a command in basinghouse when it was besieged where he persuaded his disciple faithorn to inlist under him as the latter in his dedication of the art of graving to sir robert expressly tells him and where peake himself was taken prisoner see a letter from oliver cromwell to the speaker of the house of commons on the reduction of basinghouse printed in the annual register for      he was buried in the chuch of st stephen london pain fishers catal of monuments   miniature makes a great figure in this reign by the luster thrown on it by  peter oliver  the eldest son of isaac oliver and worthy of being compared with his father in some respects the son even appears the greater master as he did not confine his talent to single heads peter copied in watercolours several capital pictures with signal success by the catalogues of king charles i and king james ii it appears that there were thirteen pieces of this master in the royal collection chiefly historic miniatures seven of them are still preserved in queen carolines closet at kensington at the earl of exeters at burleigh is the story of venus and adonis painted by peter and dated      virtue mentions another which was in mr halsteds sale in may      it represented joseph the virgin and the child asleep eight inches wide and five high on it was written his name with the termination french p olivier fecit      another piece a fine drawing in indian ink was copied by him from a picture of raphael in the collection of king charles st john presenting a cross to the child kneeling before the virgin the original was sold after the kings death to the spanish ambassador for  00 l jerome laniere bought peters drawing and sold it for twenty guineas to mr john evelyn from whom it came to the present sir john evelyn the duke of devonshire has the portrait of edward  th when an infant the drapery highly ornamented and finished a copy from holbein in the first edition i by mistake ascribed this to isaac oliver but peters mark is upon it lady elizabeth germain has at drayton the madonna and child the finest work of peter oliver in my opinion is the head of his own wife in the cabinet of the duchess of portland it is life itself i doubt whether his father ever excelled this piece i have a head of the same woman drawn with black lead on the leaf of a vellom pocketbook on the reverse is his own portrait in profile both masterly and in black and red chalk i have a boys head larger than he generally painted of great nature and vivacity at kensington below stairs is the portrait of peter oliver by hanneman who painted the wise too but i know not where the latter is  it is extraordinary sir andrew fountain lost many miniatures by a fire at whites original chocolate house in st jamess street about thirty years ago where he had hired two rooms for a repository of part of his collection probably some of the works of the olivers of cooper etc were destroyed there that more of the works peter oliver etched a few small histories but virtue does not specify the subjects of this excellent master are not known as he commonly made duplicates of his pictures reserving one of each for himself on this subject russel the painter related to or connected with the olivers told virtue a remarkable story the greater part of the collection of king charles being dispersed in the troubles among which were several of the olivers charles ii who remembered and was desirous of recovering them made many inquiries about them after the restoration at last he was told by one rogers virtue says he was very great at court it was probably progers well known for being employed in the kings private pleasures see memoires de grammont of isleworth that both the father and son were dead but that the sons widow was living at isleworth and had many of their works the king went very privately and unknown with rogers to see them the widow showed several finished and unfinished with many of which the king being pleased asked if she would sell them she replied she had a mind the king should see them first and if he did not purchase them she should think of disposing of them the king discovered himself on which she produced some more pictures which she seldom showed the king desired her to set her price she said she did not care to make a price with his majesty she would leave it to him but promised to look over her husbands books and let his majesty know what prices his father the late king had paid the king took away what he liked and sent rogers to mrs oliver with the option of  000 l or an annuity of  00 l for her life she chose the latter some years afterward it happened that the kings mistresses having begged all or most of these pictures mrs oliver who was probably a prude and apt to express herself like a prude said on hearing it that if she had thought the king would have given them to such whores and strumpets and bastards he never should have had them this reached the court the poor womans salary was stopped and she never received it afterward the rest of the limnings which the king had not taken fell into the hands of mrs russels father  peter oliver says virtue died about the year      aged near  0 but this must be a mistake as his fathers drawing at kensington finished by the son is dated      when by that account peter was not above twelve years old from his age and the story of his widow it is more likely that he died before the restoration probably the date      should be      he was buried with his father in the blacksryars  as in none of these accounts mention is made of any children of peter oliver i conclude that isaac oliver glasspainter born in      was son of the younger brother james among the verses printed by the university of cambridge in      on the death of mr edward king miltons lycidas one of the english copies is inscribed isaac oliver pecks life of milton p    who i suppose was the glasspainter and then about the age of twentytwo as appears from the following inscription on a painted window in christchurch oxford liver aetat suae    anno   00 pinxit deditque the story is st peter delivered out of prison the drawing and execution good but the coloring in some parts faint the long life of this person after the fire of london he was employed jointly with mr hook in surveying and laying out the ground for rebuilding the city see biogr britann vol iv p      marginal note estimable for his own merit and that of his family served almost alone to preserve the secret of painting on glass  a secret which however has never been lost as i shall show in a moment by a regular series of the professors the first interruption given to it was by the reformation which banished the art out of churches yet it was in some measure kept up in the escutcheons of the nobility and gentry in the windows of their seats toward the end of queen elizabeth it was omitted even there yet the practice did not entirely cease the chapel of our lady at warwick was ornamented anew by robert dudley earl of leicester and his countess and the cipher of the glasspainters name yet remains with the date      and in some of the chapels at oxford the art again appears dating itself in      by the hand of no contemptible master i could supply even the gap of fortyeight years by many dates on flemish glass but nobody ever supposed that the secret was lost so early as the reign of james i and that it has not perished since will be evident from the following series reaching to the present hour  the portraits in the windows of the library at all souls oxford  in the chapel at queenscollege twelve

  00  windows at queens newcollege and maudlin by william price the son now living whose colors are fine whose drawing good and whose taste in ornaments and mosaic is far superior to any of his predecessors is equal to the antique to the good italian masters and only surpassed by his own singular modesty it may not be unwelcome to the curious reader to see some anecdotes of the revival of taste for painted glass in england price as i have said was the only painter in that style for many years in england afterward one rowell a pmber at reading did some things particularly for the late henry earl of pembroke but rowells colors soon vanished at last he found out a very durable and btifull red but he died in a year or two and the secret with him a man at birmingham began the same art in      or    and fitted up a window for lord  in the church of hagley but soon broke a little after him one peckitt at york began the same business and has made good proficience a few lovers of the art collected some dispersed panes from ancient buildings particularly the late lord cobham who erected a gothic temple at stowe and filled it with arms of the old nobility etc about the year      one asciotti an italian who had married a flemish woman brought a parcel of painted glass from flanders and sold it for a very few guineas to the hon mr bateman of old windsor upon that i sent asciotti again to flanders who brought me   0 pieces for which including the expense of his journey i paid him thirtysix guineas his wife made more journeys for the same purpose and sold her cargoes to one palmer a glazier in st martinslane who immediately raised the price to one two five guineas for a single piece and fitted up entire windows with them and with mosaics of plain glass of different colors in     paterson an auctioneer at essexhouse in the strand exhibited the first auctions of painted glass imported in like manner from flanders all this manufacture consisted in rounds of scripturestories stained in black and yellow or in  of black and white birds and flowers in colors and flemish coats of    henry gyles john    edward norgate  though of a very inferior walk in the profession deserves to be remembered for his uncommon excellence in his way he was son of dr robert norgate master of bennetcollege cambridge where edward was born he was brought up by nicholas felton bishop of ely who married his mother and who observing his inclination to limning and heraldry permitted him to indulge his genius as he had good judgment in pictures he was sent into italy by the great collector thomas earl of arundel to purchase for him but returning by marseilles and by some accident being disappointed of the remittances he expected and totally unknown there he was observed by a french gentleman to walk many hours every day on the course in a disconsolate manner the gentleman inquiring into his circumstances told him that perceiving he was able to walk at least twenty miles a day if he would set out on his journey homewards he would furnish him handsomely for a footman by which assistance norgate arrived in his own country fullers worthies in cambridgeshire among the accounts of the lord harrington quoted above is the following entry  paid to edward norgate by warrant from the council april         for his pains taken to write and lymne in gold and colors certain letters written from his majesty to the king of persia the sum of ten pounds  these letters were undoubtedly in answer to those brought by that singular adventurer sir antony shirley ambassador from the sophy to his own sovereign  the warrant for restoring the use of the old english march which i have set forth in the catalogue of noble authors was illuminated by this person but the best evidence of his abilities is a curious patent lately discovered the present earl of stirling received from a relation an old box of neglected writings among which he found the original commission of charles i appointing his lordships predecessor alexander earl of stirling commander in chief of nova scotia with the confirmation of the grant of that province made by james i in the initial letter are the portraits of the king sitting on the throne delivering the patent to the earl and round the border representations in miniature of the customs huntings fishings and productions of the country all in the highest preservation and so admirably executed that it was believed of the pencil of vandyck but as i know no instance of that master having painted in this manner i cannot doubt but it was the work of norgate allowed the best illuminator of that age and generally employed says fuller to make the initial letters in the patents of peers and commissions of ambassadors fuller concludes his account of him in these words he was an excellent herald by the title of  it is extraordinary that fuller who was acquainted with him did not know the title of his office it appears by the warrant for the march that norgate was windsorherald he was also clerk of the signet v masterss history of corpus christi coll camb p     and which was the crown of all a right honest man exemplary his patience in his sickness whereof i was an eye witness though a complication of diseases stone ulcer in the bladder etc seized on him he died at the heralds office dec       0  solomon de cause  a gascon was prince henrys drawingmaster all i have learnt that the front of wilton by inigo jones was conducted by this de cause we know of him is that in      the year of the princes death he published a book entitled la perspective ou raison des ombres et miroirs with several engraved plates folio it is addressed from richmond palace to prince henry after he had been as he tells his highness two or three years in his service and another tract in folio on mechanic powers       this young prince was a great lover of the arts and laid the foundation of the collection which his brother completed the medals were purchased by him and vanderdort in his catalogue mentions several statues and pictures which king charles inherited from prince henry in the appendix to birchs life of this prince are several letters from sir edward conway in one page     of which he mentions having bought a picture of the four evangelists whom he calls affectedly the most faithful glorious and excellent secretaries that ever were to tbe infinite incomprehensible prince desiring mr adam newton secretary to the most hopeful powerful and glorious earthly prince to present it to his royal highness and in others is much talk of a negotiation in which he was employed by the same prince to engage an eminent painter of delft to come to england this was mireveldt who had many solicitations afterward from king charles on the same head but none succeeded the printed letters are from the harleian mss and describe mireveldt as very fantastic and capricious mr west has two others one from mireveldt to sir edward conway the other from sir edward in which appears the cause of mireveldts uncertainty he was afraid of being stayed in england by authority and stipulated that he should have liberty to return in three months  in      he had again engaged to come but was prevented by the breaking out of the plague mireveldt is said to have painted five thousand portraits

institution in the subsequent reign but loyd state worthies p     is not only positive for the former era but affirms that at the motion of king james himself who gave two thousand pounds toward the undertaking sir francis crane erected the house at mortlack for the execution of the design and this is confirmed by authentic evidence in rymers foedera vol xviii p    is an acknowledgment from king charles in the very first year of his reign that he owes  000 l to sir francis crane for tapestry francisco crane militi a d       for three suits of gold tapestry for our use we stand indebted to sir

do testify and though made for others will prove monuments of his fame he departed this life on the   th of august      aged sixtyone and lies buried near the pulpit in this church mary his wife and nicholas his son lie also buried in the same grave she died november   th and he on the   th of september      h s posuit  stone had three sons henry nicholas and john the two eldest were sent to italy to study the youngest was educated at oxford being designed for a clergyman but in the civil war he entered into the army on the kings side during that period this john stone published a book on fortification called enchiridion with many small cuts etched by himself but without his name the kings forces being routed young stone and a companion made their escape the latter was taken and hanged before his fathers door in smithfield but stone hid himself in his fathers house in longacre for above a twelvemonth without the knowledge says virtue of his father whence i suppose he had either offended the old man by quitting his studies for arms or the father was too prudent to risk the emoluments of his profession by engaging in partydissentions john at last found means of retiring to france where he lived some years and i conclude applied himself to the arts as we shall find him after his return engaged in his fathers business nicholas the second son was of a promising genius and while abroad modelled after the antiques so well that his works have been mistaken for the best italian masters mr bird the statuary had the laocoon and berninis apollo and daphne in terra cotta by this nicholas stone and virtue saw a book with many of his drawings of palaces churches and other buildings in italy he returned to england in      and died the same year as his father  henry the eldest son who erected the monument for his father mother and brother carried on in conjunction with john the business of statuary after his fathers death though henry addicted himself chiefly to painting and was an excellent copyist of vandyck and the italian masters he is generally known by the name of old stone i suppose to distinguish him from his brother john henry wrote a book a thin folio entitled the third part of the art of painting taken mostly from the ancients virtue who saw this book was uncertain whether the two former parts were composed by stone or by some other author the accounts of nicholas stone sen which i have quoted above were continued by john while he and henry worked in partnership among other articles are the following  in the year of our lord      my brother and i made a tomb for the lord ashley for which we had  0 l  formerly i made a little tomb of white marble being an eagle with an escutcheon upon his breast set up at sunning in barkshire for

of none of which rise above  00 l consequently the sons i suppose never attained the reputation of the father  a head of sir jonas moore with a scroll of paper in his hand was henry stone lilly pinx

appointed to inspect the lands that had belonged to the king henry stone died in      and was buried near his father where a monument was erected and this epitaph written for him by his brother john  to the memory of henry stone of longacre painter and statuary who having passed the greatest part of thirtyseven years in holland france and italy achieved a fair renown for his excellency in arts and languages and departed this life on the   th day of august a d      and lies buried near the pulpit in this church his friends bewail him thus could arts appease inexorable fate thou had survived this untimely date or could our votes have taken place the sun had not been set thus at it is glorious noon thou should have lived such statues to have shown as michael angelo might have wished his own and still thy most unerring pencil might have raised his admiration and delight that the beholders should inquiring stand whether twas natures or the artists hand but thy too early death we now deplore there was not art that thou could live to more nor could thy memory by age be lost if not preserved by this pious cost thy names a monument that will surpass the parian marble or corinthian brass john stone to perfect his fraternal affections erected this monument  and a little lower june      four rare stones are gone the father and three sons in memory of whom their near kinsman charles stoakes repaired this monument  john stone the last of the family died soon after the restoration and stoakes the person abovementioned from whom virtue learned all these circumstances came into possession of many drawings prints paintings models etc particularly many portraits of the family in small by henry stone and from stoakes the pictures fell into the hands of mr cock the auctioneer  bernard jansen  was an architect at the same time that nicholas stone was the fashionable statuary they were employed together as appears by the foregoing memorandums on the tomb of mr sutton the founder of the charterhouse of what country jansen among the harleian mss no   art    are articles of agreement between paul dewes esquire and jan jansen stonecuter for setting up a tomb in the church of stowlangtost dated june         was does not appear by both his names i conclude a foreigner and probably a fleming as he was a professed imitator of dieterling a famous builder in the netherlands who wrote several books on architecture jansen was engaged on many great works this account virtue received from stoakes the relation of stone mentioned in the preceding article here he built audleyinn audleyinn near walden in essex was an immense pile of building the rooms large but some of them not lofty in proportion and a gallery of ninetyfive yards which with the chapel and great council chamber each projecting backwards from the ends of the gallery have been demolished the present chapel was lately fitted up the screen accompanying the ascent of steps from the hall was designed by sir john vanbrugh and has no relation to the rest of the building that injudicious architect too advised the destruction of the first court which consisted of noble corridores supported by columns of alabaster in the room of which he built two ugly brick walls which cost   00 l the marble pillars of the chapel were purchased by lord onslow king william bought thence some suits of tapestry now at windsor for which he paid   00 l the drawingroom called the fishroom is a noble chamber the cieling and a deep frieze adorned in stucco with sea monsters and great fishes swimming all the costly chimneypieces have been sold over that in the gallery were the labors of hercules and in the cieling the loves of the gods many of the friezes still extant are in very good taste it was erected by thomas howard earl of suffolk lord treasurer in the reign of james i and was generally supposed to be founded on spanish gold his countess who had great sway with him being notoriously corrupt there is a whole length of her in the hall at gorhambury she was mother of the memorable frances countess of essex and somerset whose escutcheon still      remains entire in the chancel of the church at walden one of the lightest and most beautiful parish churches i have seen and the greater part of northumberlandhouse except the frontispiece which virtue discovered to be the work of the next artist  gerard chrismas  before the portal of that palace was altered by the present earl of northumberland there were in a freeze near the top in large capitals c ae an enigma long inexplicable to antiquarians virtue found that at the period when the house was built lived chrismas an architect and carver of reputation who gave the design of aldersgate and cut the basrelief on it of james i on horseback and thence concluded that those letters signified chrismas aedificavit in the new description of london vol   it is said that from some letters on the front when it was last rebuilt it was inferred that one moses glover was the architect which is not improbable as that great curiosity at sionhouse the survey of sion and the neighboring villages was performed by moses glover painter and architectr in that valuable plan are views of the royal houses and seats in the neighborhood jansen probably built the house which was of brick and the frontispiece which was of stone was finished by chrismas the carvers of the great ship built at woolwich by mr peter pett in      were john and mathias chrismas sons of gerard virtue had seen a printed copy of verses in praise of the father   john smithson  was an architect in the service of the earls of newcastle he built part of welbeck in   0  the ridinghouse as appears by his name over the gate there in      and the stables in      and when william cavendish earl and afterward duke of newcastle proposed to repair and make great additions to bolsovercastle smithson it is said was sent to italy to collect designs from them i suppose it was that the noble apartment erected by that duke and lately pulled down was completed smithson dying in      many of smithsons drawings were purchased by the late lord byron from his descendents who lived at bolsover in the chancel of which church smithson is buried with this inscription reader beneath this plain stone buried lies smithsons remainder of mortality whose skill in architecture did deserve a fairer tomb his memory to preserve but since his nobler works of piety to god his justice and his charity are gone to heaven a building to prepare not made with hands his friends contented are he here shall rest in hope till the worlds shall burn and intermingle ashes with his urn ob december          his son a man of some skill in architecture was buried in the same grave   butler  a name preserved only by peacham in whose time butler seems to have been still living for speaking of architecture and of the lord treasurer salisbury who he adds as he favors all learning and excellency so he is a principal patron of this art having lately employed mr butler and many excellent artists for the beautifying his  especially his chapel at hatfield  stephen harrison  who calls himself joyner and architect invented the triumphal arches erected in london for the reception of james i they were engraved by kip on a few leaves in folio a work i never saw but in the library at chatsworth  i shall conclude what i have to say on the reign of king james with a brief account of a few of his medallists this article is one of the most deficient in virtues notes he had found but very slight materials though equally inquisitive on this head with the rest one must except the subject of the two simons of whose works as he himself published a most curious volume i shall omit the mention of them in this catalogue only desiring that virtues account of the two simons and hollar and the catalogues of the collections of king charles king james and the duke of buckingham may be regarded as parts of this his great design by those specimens one sees how perfect he wished and labored to make the whole  i was in hopes of completing this article by having recourse to mr evelyns discourse on medals but was extremely disappointed to sind that in a folio volume in which he has given the plates and inscriptions of a regular series of our medals he takes not the least notice of the gravers i should not have expected that a virtuoso so knowing would have contented himself with descriptions of the persons represented he who had it in his inclination and generally in his power to inform posterity of almost every thing they would wish to learn had mr evelyn never regretted his ignorance of the names of the workmen of those inimitable medals of the seleucidae of the fair coins of augustus and of the denarii of the other roman emperors was he satisfied with possessing the effigies of tiberius claudius irene without wishing to know the names of the ingenious and more harmless gravers  why did he think posterity would not be as curious to learn who were the medallists of charles ii james i mary i he has omitted all names of gravers except in two or three of the plates and even there says not a word of the artist for instance in a medal of charles i p     under the kings bust are the letters n r f i cannot discover who this n r was unless it was norbert rotier who arrived in the reign of charles ii in that case the medal in question must have been executed after the restoration thomas rawlins was a graver of the mint about that time perhaps he had a brother who worked in partnership with him i was so surprised at this omission that i concluded mr evelyn must have treated of the gravers in some other part of the work i turned to the index and to my greater surprise found almost every thing but what i wanted in the single letter n which contains but twentysix articles are the following subjects which i believe would puzzle any man to guess how they found their way into a discourse on medals nails of the cross negros narcotics neocoros nations whence of such various dispositions nightingale noah natural and artificial curiosities noses navigation nurses of what importance their temper and dispositions neapolitans their character  in short mr evelyn who loved to know was too fond of telling the world all he knew among other branches of science if one can call it so mr evelyn studied physiognomy and found dissimulation boldness cruelty and ambition in every touch and stroke of fullers picture of oliver cromwells face which he says was the most resembling portrait of the protector in vandycks earl of strafford a steady serious and judicious countenance and so in many others whose characters from knowing their history he fancied he saw in their features how his divination would have been puzzled if he had been shown a picture of cromwell in the contemptible appearance which sir philip warwick says he made at his first entry into the house of commons or if my lord strafford had continued to oppose the court and had never changed sides would mr evelyn have sound his countenance so steady and judicious his virtue industry ingenuity and learning were remarkable one wishes he had written with a little more judgment  or perhaps it is not my interest to wish so it would be more prudent to shelter under his authority any part of this work that is not much to the purpose  all this author says page     of our medallists is that we had symons rawlins mr harris christian etc and then refers us to his chalcography page    where indeed he barely names two more restrick and johnson of whom i can find no other account the reader must therefore accept what little is scattered up and down in virtues mss i have already mentioned one or two in the preceding volume the first graver i meet in the reign of james is  charles antony  to whom sir thomas knyvet master of the mint in the second of that king paid by warrant  0 l for gold and workmanship for graving an offering piece of gold anthony having then the title of the kings graver i have a thin plate of silver larger than a crown piece representing king james on his throne it is very neat workmanship and probably by this antony virtue supposes this person made the medal in   0  on the peace with spain a medal not mentioned by evelyn and that he continued in office till    0 mr anstis informed him of a warrant to a brother of charles antony called  thomas antony  curatori monetae et sigillorum regis ad cudendum magnum sigillum pro episcopatu et comitatu palatino dunelm      but of neither of these brothers do i find any other traces  thomas bushel  was probably a medallist of the same age in the year      mr compton produced at the antiquarian society as i find by their minutes a gold medal larger than a crown piece on one side lord chancellor bacon in his hat and robes with this legend bacon viceco sct alb angliae cancel on the reverse thomas bushel deus est qui clausa recludit  nicholas briot  was a native of lorrain and graver of the mint to the king of france in which kingdom he was the inventor or at least one of the first proposers of coining money by a press instead of the former manner of hammering as i am ignorant myself in the mechanic part of this art and have not even the pieces quoted by virtue i shall tread very cautiously and only transcribe the titles of some memorials which he had seen and from whence i conclude a litterary controversy was carried on in france on the subject of this new invention to which according to custom the old practicioners seem to have objected as probably interfering with the abuses of which they were in prescriptive possession  raisons de nicolas briot tailleur et

afterward find him in the service of the crown of england where projectors were more favorably received from these circumstances i conclude he arrived in the reign of king james though he did not make his way to court before the accession of king charles the patron of genius briots first public work was a medal of that prince exhibited in evelyn with the artists name and the date      to all or to almost all his coins and medals he put at least the initial letter of his name he was employed both in england and scotland in      as appears by rymers foedera tom xix p     a special commission was appointed for making trial of the experience skill and industry of nicholas briot in the coinage of money at the mint dated june         at westminster this was the project he had attempted in france by instruments mills and presses to make better money and with less expense to the crown than by the way of hammering the scheme was probably approved for in the very next year we find him coining money upon the regular establishment there is extant a parchment roll containing the accounts of sir robert harley knight of the bath master worker of his majestys moneys of gold and silver within the tower of london in the reign of king charles i from november        to august        in this account in      are payments to briot for coining various parcels of gold and silver which are followed by this entry  and delivered to his majesty in fair silver moneys at oatlands by sir thomas aylesbury viz iij crowns and iij half crowns of briots moneys and iij crowns and iij half crowns and ten shillings of the monoyers making  these comparative pieces were probably presented to the king by sir robert harley briots patron to show the superior excellence of the latters method  briot returned to france about      having formed that excellent scholar thomas simon  in a private family the name of which he does not mention virtue saw a peachstone on which was carved the head of king charles full faced with a laurel and on the reverse st george on horseback with the garter round it and on one side above the kings head these letters  the tradition in that family was that the carver having been removed from the service of the crown and at last obtaining the place of poor knight at windsor cut that curiosity to show he was not superannuated nor incapable of his office as he had been represented if the mark  signified nicholas briot as is probable either the story is fictitious or briot did not return to france on the breaking out of the civil war the latter is most likely as in

dispersion of the kings collection and of the earl of arundels the accession of this prince was the first era of real taste in england as his temper was not profuse the expense he made in collections and the rewards he bestowed on men of true genius and merit are proofs of his judgment he knew how and when to bestow queen elizabeth was avaricious with pomp james i lavish with meanness a prince who patronizes the arts and can distinguish abilities enriches his country and is at once generous and an oeconomist charles had virtues to make a nation happy fortunate if he had not thought that he alone knew how to make them happy and that he alone ought to have the power of making them so  his character as far as it relates to my subject is thus given by lilly he had many excellent parts in nature was an excellent horseman would shoot well at a mark had singular skill in limning was a good judge of pictures a good mathematician not unskillfull in music well read in divinity excellently in history and law he spoke several languages and writ well good language and style perinchief is still more particular his soul says that writer was stored with a full knowledge of the nature of things and easily comprehended almost all kinds of arts that either were for delight or of a public use for he was ignorant of nothing but of what he thought it became him to be negligent for many parts of learning that are for the ornament of a private person are beneath the cares of a crowned head he was well skilled in things of antiquity could judge of medals whether they had the number of years they pretended unto his libraries and cabinets were full of those things on which length of time put the value of rarities in painting he had so excellent a fancy that he would supply the defect of art in the workman and suddenly draw those lines give those airs and lights which experience and practice had not taught the painter he could judge of fortifications and censure whether the cannon were mounted to execution or no he had an excellent skill in guns knew all that belonged to their making the exactest arts of building ships for the most necessary uses of strength or good sailing together with all their furniture were not unknown to him he understood and was pleased with the making of mr oughtred made a horizontal instrument for delineating dials for him elias allen says that celebrated mathematician having been sworn his majestys servant had a purpose to present his majesty with some new years gift and requested me to devise some pretty instrument for him i answered that i have heard that his majesty delighted much in the great concave dial at whitehall and what fitter instrument could he have than my horizontal which was the very same represented in flat biogr brit vol   p      delamain another mathematician made a ring dial for the king which his majesty valued so much that on the morning before he was beheaded he ordered it to be given to the duke of york with a book showing it is use ib p      clocks and watches he comprehended the art of printing there was not any one gentleman of all the three kingdoms that could compare with him in an universality of knowledge he encouraged all the parts of learning and he delighted to talk with all kind of artists and with so great a facility did apprehend the mysteries of their professions that he did sometimes say he thought he could get his living if necessitated by any trade he knew of but making of hangings although of these he understood much and was greatly delighted in them for he brought some of the most curious workmen from foreign parts to make them here in england life of charles i at the end of the icon basilike edit        with regard to his knowledge of pictures i find the following anecdote from a book called the original and growth of printing by richard atkyns esquire this excellent prince says that author who was not only aliquis in omnibus but singularis in omnibus hearing of rare heads painted amongst several other pictures brought me from rome sent sir james palmer to bring them to whitehall to him where were present diverse picturedrawers and painters he asked them all of whose hand that was some guest at it others were of another opinion but none was positive at last said the king this is of such a mans hand i know it as well as if i had seen him draw it but said he is there but one mans hand in this picture none did discern whether there was or not but most concluded there was but one hand said the king i am sure there are two hands have workt in it for i know the hand that drew the heads but the hand that did the rest i never saw before upon this a gentleman that had been at rome about ten years before affirmed that he saw this very picture with the two heads unfinished at that time and that he heard his brother who staid there some years after him say that the widow of the painter that drew it wanting money got the best master she could find to finish it and make it saleable this story which in truth is but a blind one especially as mr atkyns does not mention even the name of the painter of his own picture seems calculated to prove a fact of which i have no doubt his majestys knowledge of hands the gentleman who stood by and was so long before he recollected so circumstantial a history of the picture was i dare say a very good courtier  the king is said not only to have loved painting but to have practiced it it is affirmed that rubens corrected some of his de piles in his life of rubens says that the kings motherinlaw mary de medici designed well majestys drawings  it was immediately after his accession that charles began to form his collection the crown was already in possesssion of some good pictures henry viii had several what painters had been here had added others prince henry as i have said had begun a separate collection both of paintings and statues all these charles assembled and sent commissions into france and italy to purchase more cross vincentio carducci in his dialogo della pittura printed at madrid in      calls him michael de la crux others say it was henry stone jun who was sent to spain when charles was at that court the king of spain gave him a celebrated picture by titian called the venus del pardo see catal p  0  and the cain and abel by john of bologna which king charles afterward bestowed on the duke of buckingham who placed it in the garden of yorkhouse see peacham p  0  from whitlocke p    we have the following information in december the queen was brought to bed of a second daughter named elizabeth to congratulate her majestys safe delivery the hollanders sent hither a solemn ambassy and a noble present a large piece of ambergrease two fair china basins almost transparent a curious clock and four rare pieces of tintorets and titians painting some supposed that they did it to ingratiate the more with our king in regard his fleet was so powerful at sea and they saw him resolved to maintain his right and dominion there was dispatched into spain to copy the works of titian there and no doubt as soon as the royal taste was known many were brought over and offered to sale at court the ministers and nobility were not backward with presents of the same nature various are the accounts of the jewels and bawbles presented to magnificent elizabeth in the catalogue of king charless collection are recorded the names of several of the court who ingratiated themselves by offerings of pictures and curiosities but the noblest addition was made by the king himself he purchased at a great the lowest i have heard was  0000 l so r symondes said at kensington are several pieces of the venetian and lombard schools in uniform frames of black and gold the pictures themselves much damaged these i take to have been part of the collection from mantua price the entire cabinet of the duke of mantua then reckoned the most valuable in europe but several of those pictures were spoiled by the quicksilver on the frames owing i suppose to carelessness in packing them up vanderdort from whom alone we have this account does not specify all that suffered though in general he is minute even in describing their frames the list valuable as it is notwithstanding all it is blunders inaccuracy and bad english was i believe never completed which might be owing to the sudden death of the composer there are accounts in ms of many more pictures indubitably of that collection not specified in the printed catalogue  now i have mentioned this person vanderdort it will not be foreign to the purpose to give some little account of him especially as to him we owe the original copy of which there were two or three transcripts is preserved in the ashmolean museum at oxford tom hearne once thought of publishing it but at last concluding it was german gave it over mr virtue better grounded and still more patient transcribed it for the press but dying before the impression was finished it

of that royal museum  abraham vanderdort a dutchman had worked for the emperor rodolphus whose service he left we do not know on what occasion he brought away with him a bust of a woman modelled in wax as large as the life which he had begun for that monarch but prince henry was so struck with it that though the emperor wrote several times for it the young prince would neither part with the work nor the workman telling him he would give him as good entertainment as any emperor would  and indeed vanderdort seems to have made no bad bargain he parted with the bust to the prince upon condition

king of a book of prints by albert durer of a head in plaster of charles v and of the arm of the king of denmark in the kings collection was a portrait of the king of denmark by vanderdort which proves that he dabbled too in painting modelled from the life it is certain that the poor man had great gratitude to or great awe of charles i the king had recommended to him to take particular care of a miniature by gibson the parable of the lost sheep vanderdort laid it up so carefully that when the king asked him for it he could not find it and hanged himself in despair sandersons graphice

a portrait of the earl of exeter who collected so many of carlos works and a head of charles cavendish a boy with the eyes shut said to be taken after his death but it seems too highly colored and is probably sleeping had drawn for that duke the portraits of a prince and princess of brunswic but excused himself from obeying the summons by pleading that he had not studied long enough in rome and was not yet worthy of painting for the king simon vouet an admired french painter who while very young had been sent over in   0  to draw the portrait of some lady of great rank retired hither from paris was invited by king charles with promise of great rewards to return to england but declined the offer felibien his majesty was desirous too of having something of the hand of bernini vandyck drew in one piece the full face and the three quarter face and the profile of the king from which bernini made a bust that was consumed or stolen in the fire of whitehall it is very uncertain what became of this bust virtue from several circumstances which i shall lay before the reader believed it was not destroyed cooper the printseller told him that he had often heard norrice framemaker to the court and who saved several of the pictures averr that he was in the room where the bust used to stand over a corner chimney and that it was taken away before that chamber was destroyed lord cutts who commanded the troops was impatient to blow up that part and yet after he had ordered the drums to beat it was half an hour before the explosion was begun time enough to have saved the bust if it was not stolen before sir john stanley then deputychamberlain was of the latter opinion he was at dinner in craigcourt when the fire began which was about three oclock he immediately went to the palace and perceived only an inconsiderable smoke in a garret not in the principal building he found sir christopher wren and his workmen there and the gates all shut looking at berninis bust he begged sir christopher to take care of that and the statues the latter replied take you care of what you are concerned in and leave the rest to me sir john said it was above five hours after this before the fire reached that part norrice afterward dug in the ruins of that chamber but could not discover the least fragment of marble the crouching venus in the same apartment was known to be stolen being discovered after a concealment of four years and retaken by the crown virtue thought that the brazen bust of king charles in the passage near westminster hall was not taken from berninis of which casts are extant but of an earlier date in the imperial library at vienna says dr edward brown in his travels is a head of king charles in white marble but this cannot be berninis as brown wrote in      and the fire of whitehall happened in      it was on seeing this picture that bernini pronounced as is well known that there was something unfortunate in the countenance of charles the same artist made a bust too of mr baker who carried the picture to rome the duke of kents father bought the latter bust at sir peter lelys sale it is now in the possession of lord royston and was reckoned preferable to that of the king the hair is in prodigious quantity and incomparably loose and free the pointband very fine mr baker paid bernini an hundred broad pieces for his but for the kings bernini received a thousand roman crowns the king was so pleased with his own that he desired to have one of the queen too but that was prevented by the war in the church at chelsea is a fine monument in a niche for the lady jane cheyney she is represented lying on her right side and leaning on a bible this tomb was the work of bernini and cost  00 l   among the strafford papers is an evidence of this princes affection for his pictures in a page   0 vol ii letter from mr garrard dated november        speaking of two masks that were to be exhibited that winter he says a great room is now journal of the house of commons july         ordered that the boarded masquehouse at whitehall the masquehouse at st jamess and the courts of guard be forthwith pulled down and sold away building only for this use betwixt the guardchamber and banqueting house of fir only weatherboarded and slightly covered at the marriage of the queen of bohemia i saw one set up there but not of that vastness that this is which will cost too much money to be pulled down and yet down it must when the masks are over  in another of december    the same person says here are two masks intended this winter the king is now in practicing his which shall be presented at twelfthtide most of the young lords about the town who are good dancers attend his majesty in this business the other the queen makes at shrovetide a new house being erected in the first court at whitehall which cost the king   00 l only of deal boards because the king will not have his pictures in the banquettinghouse hurt with lights  the most capital purchase made by king charles were the cartoons of raphael now at hampton court they had remained in flanders from the time that leo x sent them thither to be copied in tapestry the money for the tapestry having never been paid rubens told the king of them and where they were and by his means they were bought  it may be of use to collectors and virtuosi for whose service this work is composed to know when they meet with the ruins of that royal cabinet or of the earl of arundels on the kings pictures was this mark  or  on his drawings a large star thus  on the earls a smaller   the dials at whitehall were erected by the order of charles while he was prince mr gunter drew the lines and wrote the description and use of them printed in a small tract by order of king james in      there were five dials afterward some were made of glass in a pyramidal shape by francis hill and placed in the same garden one or two of these may still be extant virtue saw them at buckinghamhouse in st jamess park from whence they were sold  it looks as if charles had had some thoughts of erecting a monument for his father in the lodgings of the warden of newcollege oxford was a mausoleum with arms altartomb columns and inscriptions in honor of that prince dated    0 it is certain king charles had no less inclination for architecture than for the other arts the intended palace at whitehall would have been the most truly magnificent and beautiful fabric of any of the kind in europe his majesty did not send to italy and flanders for architects as he did for albano and vandyck he had inigo jones under the direction of that genius the king erected the house at greenwich  charles had in his service another man both architect and painter of whom though excellent in neither branch the reader will perhaps not dislike some account as he was a remarkable person and is little known  sir balthazar gerbier douvilly of antwerp was born about      came young into england and was a retainer of the duke of buckingham as early as      in finettes master of the ceremonies it is said alonzo contarini ambassador from venice came to mr gerbier a gentleman serving the duke of buckingham sanderson graphice page    calls him a common penman who pensiled the dialogue probably the decalogue in the dutch church london his first rise of preferment it is certain that he ingratiated himself much with that favorite and attended him into spain where he was even employed in the treaty of marriage though ostensibly acting only in the character of a painter he painted small figures in distemper de piles while in spain he drew the infanta in miniature which was sent over to king james among the harleian mss is a letter from the duchess of buckingham to her sr balthazar gerbier vandyck pinx tchambars sculp  lord in spain i pray you if you have any idle time in a letter dated      it is said the king and queen were entertained at supper at gerbier the dukes painters house which could not stand him in less than  000 l the countess of northumberland has a large oval miniature of the duke of buckingham on horseback the head is well painted the figure

drawn up by gerbier who had been employed by the duke in several of the purchases however there is some appearance of his having fallen into disgrace with his patron in one of virtues mss is a passage that seems to be an extract though the author is not quoted in which the duke treats gerbier with the highest contempt the transcript is so obscure and imperfect that i shall give it in virtues own words  king james i ill and dying the duke of buckingham was advised to apply a plaster to his stomach which he did with proper advice of doctors physicians of the king but the king dying the duke was blamed  one eglesham printed a scurrilous the title was the forerunners of revenge in two petitions the one to the king the other to the parliament concerning the duke of buckinghams poisoning king james and the marquis of hamilton by george englisham physician to king james quo      by the date of this piece i suppose it was reprinted at the beginning of the war the piece itself was transcribed by mr baker of st johns coll camb from the printed copy in possession of dr zachary gray editor of hudibrass vide also loyds state worthies p         libel and flew away into flanders  i was told by sir balthazar gerbier though his testimony be odious to any man that eglesham dealt with him in flanders for a piece of money not more than  00 guilders to defray the charges to imprint his recantation of which the duke bid gerbier join malice and knavery together and spit their venom till they split and he would pay for printing that also  nothing can be built upon so vague a foundation it is certain that immediately after the accession of king charles gerbier was employed in flanders to negotiate privately a treaty with spain the very treaty in which rubens was commissioned on the part of the infanta and for which end that great painter came to england among the conwaypapers i found a very curious and long letter from gerbier himself on this occasion which though too prolix to insert in the body of this work i shall affix at the end not only as pertinent to my subject from the part these painters had in so important a business but as it is more particular than any thing i know in print on that occasion  gerbier kept his ground after the death of buckingham in      he was knighted at hampton court and as he says himself in one of his books was promised by king charles the office of surveyorgeneral of the works after the death of inigo jones  in      he seems to have been employed in some other private transactions of state negotiating with the duke of orleans the kings brother who was discontented with the court the earl of leicester ambassador to paris writes sidney papers vol ii p     in one of his dedications mentioned hereafter gerbier puts this lord in mind of his having been in a public employment when his lordship was at paris and de piles says that the duke of buckingham finding him a man of good understanding recommended him to the king who sent him as his agent to brussels to mr secretary windebank nov    i received a packet from garbier to monsieur d d french kings brother  july         he took the oaths of allegiance and supremacy having a bill of naturalization journals of the commons from that time to the death of the king i find no mention of him though i do not doubt but a man of so supple and intriguing a nature so universal an undertaker did not lie still in times of such dark and busy complexion however whether miscarrying or neglected virtue says he was much hated and persecuted by the antimonarchic party being always loyal and faithful to the king and his son which may explain and soften what is said above of his testimony being odious to any man he bought goods at king charless sale to the value of   0 l in      he appears not only in the character of author but founder of an academy in that year he published a thin quarto entitled the interpreter of the academie for foreign languages and all noble sciences and exercises to all fathers of families and lovers of virtue the first part by sir balthazar gerbier knight land french and english with a there is another print of him half length by pontius after vandyck in which he is styled bruxellas prolegatus print of his head in oval and this motto heureux qui en dieu se confie it is a most trifling superficial rhapsody and deserved the sarcasm that butler passed on so incompetent for instance he translates arcadia orcadys an attempt in his fictitious will of philip earl of pembroke that lord is made to say all my other speeches of what color soever i give to the academy to help sir balthazars art of wellspeaking  in      he published the so virtue calls it but it is probably a mistake mr masters being possessed of a tract which is probably the same and corresponds exactly to butlers words it is entitled the art of wellspeaking being a lecture read gratis at sir b gerbiers academy dedicated to the right high and supreme power of this nation the parliament of england etc dated   jan      first lecture of geography read at sir balthazar gerbiers academy at bednalgreen by which it seems that at least his institution was opened this piece i have not seen nor the next though from virtues extract one learns another singular anecdote of this projectors history  sir balthazar gerbiers manifestation of greater profits to be done in the hot than the cold parts of america rotterdam    0 wherein is set forth that he having a commission to go there settle and make enquirys he went to cajana cayenne with his family and settled at surinam a governor there from the dutch had orders to seize upon him and all his papers and bring him back to holland which they did in a very violent manner breaking into his house killed one of his children endangered the lives of the rest of his family and narrowly escaped himself with his life having a pistol charged at his breast if he had resisted they brought him to holland he complained but got no redress the states disowning they had given any such orders however it was just before the restoration and knowing the obligations he had to england they apprehended he might give the king notice of the advantages might be gained by a settlement there  this perhaps was one among the many provocations which meeting his inclinations to france led charles ii into his impolitic though otherwise not wholly unjustifiable war with holland a people too apt even in their depressed state to hazard barbarous and brutal infraction of treaties and humanity when a glimpse of commercial interest invites it  gerbier probably returned to england with that prince for the triumphal arches erected for his reception are said to have been designed by sir balthazar  in france he published a book on fortification and in      at london a small discourse on magnificent buildings dedicated to the king in which he principally treats of solidity convenience and ornament and glances at some errors of inigo jones in the banquettinghouse here too he mentions a large room built by himself near the watergate the gate itself was designed by inigo at yorkstairs thirtyfive feet square and says that king charles i being in it in      at some representation of scenery commended it and expressed as much satisfaction with it as with the banqueting house in the piece he proposes to the lords and commons to level the streets fleetbridge and cheapside and erect a sumptuous gate at temple bar of which he had presented a draught to his majesty before this book is a different print of him with a ribband and a medal inscribed c r      the medal i suppose was given him when appointed as he says he was master of the ceremonies to charles i  his portrait in one piece with sir charles cotterel and

is a small manual entitled counsel and advice to all builders etc london      a full half of this little piece is wasted on dedications of which there are no fewer than forty and which he excuses by the example of antonio perez they are addressed to the queen mother duke of york and most of the principal nobility and courtiers the last is to his own disciple captain william wind there is a heap of a kind of various knowledge even in these dedications and some curious things as well as in the book itself particularly the prices of work and of all materials for building at that time in one place he ridicules the heads of lions which are creeping through the pilasters on the houses in great queen street built by webb the scholar of inigo jones  hempstedmarshal the seat of lord craven

various names of english families were given as sir balthazar arundel sir melchior arundel sir balthazar buckingham or sheffield the last of which gained most credit from a resemblance in the arms his royal highness gave a commission to purchase it and it was brought to leicesterhouse it appeared that a celebrated piece for which lord burlington had bid  00 l at lord radnors sale and which mr scawen it was again exposed at mr scawens sale but bought in and has since been purchased by sampson gideon bought at a still greater price was the same with this picture but not so large nor containing so many figures mr scawens had always passed for a mistress and children of the duke of buckingham but virtue discovered on that of the prince of wales an almost effaced inscription written by vandycks own hand with these words remaining la famille de balthazar  chevalier and he showed the prince that the arms on a flowerpot were the same with those on two different prints of gerbier and allusive to his name viz a chevron between three garbs or sheafs there is a group of children on the right hand very inferior to the rest of the composition and certainly not by vandyck the little girl leaning on the mothers knee was originally painted by rubens in a separate piece formerly belonging to richardson the painter since that to general skeleton and capt william hamilton and now in the collection of the lord viscount spenser it is finer than the large picture  but it is time to return to king charles  the academy erected by gerbier was probably imitated from one established by charles i in the eleventh year of his reign and called museum minervae the patent of erection is still extant in the office of the rolls none but who could prove themselves gentlemen were to be admitted to education there where they were to be instructed in arts and sciences foreign languages mathematics painting architecture riding fortification antiquities and the science of medals professors were appointed and sir francis kingston sir francis kingston who styled himself corporis armiger printed in      a translation into latin verse of chaucers troilus and cressida in whose house in covent garden the academy was held was named regent there is a small account of the design of this academy with it is rules and orders printed in      at the end of the little edition of busbequiuss epistles printed at oxford    0 is the grant of a coat of arms to the regent and professors of the museum minervae from sir john buroughs the herald dated      which arms are prefixed to the rules and orders of that establishment printed      previous to it is being set on foot a committee had been appointed in the house of lords consisting of the duke of buckingham and others for taking into consideration the state of the public schools and method of education what progress was made by this committee is not known but probably the museum minervae owed it is rise to it but it fell to the ground with the rest of the kings plans and attempts  and so great was the inveteracy to him that it seems to have become part of the religion of the time to war on the arts because they had been countenanced at court the parliament began to sell the pictures at yorkhouse so early as      but lest the necessity of their affairs should not be thought sufficient justification they colored it over with a piece of fanatic bigotry that was perfectly ridiculous passing the following votes among others july    journal of the commons   ordered that all such pictures and statues there yorkhouse as are without any superstition shall be forthwith sold for the benefit of ireland and the north  ordered that all such pictures there as have the representation of the second person in trinity upon them shall be forthwith burnt  ordered that all such pictures there as have the representation of the virgin mary upon them shall be forthwith burnt  this was a worthy contrast to archbishop laud who made a starchamberbusiness of a man who broke some painted glass in the cathedral at salisbury the cause of liberty was then and is always the only cause that can excuse a civil war yet if laud had not doated on trifles and the presbyterians been squeamish about them i question whether the nobler motives would have had sufficient influence to save us from arbitrary power they are the slightest objects that make the deepest impression on the people they seldom fight for a liberty of doing what they have a right to do but because they are prohibited or enjoined some folly that they have or have not a mind to do one comical instance of the humor of those times i find in aubreys history of surrey vol ii page  0 one bleese was hired for halfacrown a day to break the painted glass windows of the church of croydon the man probably took care not to be too expeditious in the destruction  immediately after the death i cannot help inserting a short remark here though foreign to the purpose the very day after the execution of the king was passed this vote ordered that the lord gray be desired out of haberdashershall to dispose of one hundred pounds for the service of the commonwealth as he shall think fit and that the committee at haberdashershall be required forthwith to pay the same to the said lord gray for that purpose this order is so covertly worded without any particular application at the same time that the sum is so small for any public service that joined to the circumstance of time and the known zeal of the paymaster i cannot doubt but this was intended for the reward of the executioner mr west has an authentic account of the execution in which it is said that richard brandon the executioner having sound in the kings pocket an orange stuck with cloves was offered  0 shillings for it which he refused but sold it for ten on his way home of the king several votes were passed for sale of his goods pictures statues etc  feb  0      it was referred to the committee of the navy to raise money by sale of the crown jewels hangings and other goods of the late king  two days after cromwell who as soon as he was possessed of the sole power stopped any farther ludlow prevented the sale of hampton court for which he was much blamed by some of his friends v biogr brit vol   p  0   dispersion of the royal collection and who even in this trifling instance gave an indication of his views reported from the council of state that diverse goods belonging to the state were in danger of being embezzled which notification was immediately followed by this order  that the care of the public library at st jamess and of the statues and pictures there be committed to the council of state to be preserved by them  however in the ensuing month march         the house proceeded to vote that the personal estate somerset house had a narrow escape during that lust of destruction of which an account is preserved in a very scarce tract entitled an essay on the wonders of god in the harmony of the times that preceded christ and how they met in him written in french by john despagne minister of the gospel who died in    0 and now published in english by his executor henry brown london      octavo in the preface the editor tells us that the author preached at the french church in durhamhouse where his sermons were followed by many of the nobility and gentry that demolished he says it pleased god to touch the hearts of the nobility to procure us an order of the house of peers to exercise our devotions at somersethousechapel which was the cause not only of driving away the anabaptists quakers and other sects that had got in there but also hindered the pulling down of somerset house there having been twice an order from the late usurped powers for selling the said house but we prevailed so that we still got order to exempt the chapel from being sold which broke the design of those that had bought the said house who thought for their improvement to have made a street from the garden through the ground the chapel stands on and so up the back yard to the great street of the strand by pulling down the said chapel of the late king queen and prince should be inventoried appraised and sold except such parcels of them as should be thought fit to be reserved for the use of the state and it was referred to the council of state to consider and direct what parcels of the goods and personal estates aforesaid were fit to be reserved for the use of the state certain commissioners were at the same time appointed to inventory secure and appraise the said goods and others not members of the house were appointed to make sale of the said estates to the best value the receipts were to go toward satisfying the debts and servants of the king queen and prince provided such servants had not been delinquents the rest to be applied to public uses the first thirty thousand pounds to be appropriated to the navy this vote in which they seem to have acted honestly not allowing their own members to be concerned in the sale was the cause that the collection fell into a variety of low hands and were dispersed among the painters and officers of the late kings household where many of them remained on sale with low prices affixed the principal pieces were rated more highly and some of them were even sold above their valuation  ireton on the  d of june      reported the act for sale and mention is made of some proposition of captain myldmay concerning the pictures and statues to be referred to the council of state this proposal it seems had been accepted but was revoked probably this person might be an agent of cromwell to prevent the dispersion cromwell had greater matters to attend to the sale proceeded two years afterward viz in october and november    0 the journals speak of sums of money received from the sale of the kings goods and of various applications of the money toward discharge of his debts from that time i find no farther mention of the collection in the records  with regard to the jewels the parliament immediately after the kings death ordered the crown and sceptres etc to be locked up the queen had already sold several jewels abroad to raise money and buy arms some had been sold in foreign countries early in the kings reign particularly what was called the inestimable collar of rubies there is a long warrant in rymer directing the delivery of this collar there termed the great collar of ballast rubies and sundry other valuable jewels to the duke of buckingham and earl of holland to be disposed of by them beyond the seas according to private orders which they had received from his majesty the whole piece is curious and mentions the danger there might be to the keepers of those jewels to let them go out of their hands as they were of great value and had long continued as it were in a continual descent for many years together with the crown of england foedera vol xviii p     in thoresbys museum was sir sackville crows book of accounts from the year      to      containing the receipts and disbursements of the private purse of the duke of buckingham in his

which he always wore in his ear as may be seen in his portrait on horseback by vandyck was taken out after his death and is in the collection of the duchess of portland attested by the handwriting of his daughter the princess of orange and was given to the earl of portland by king william tavernier book iv chap    mentions having a diamond on which were engraved the arms of charles i the sophy of persia and his court were extremely surprised at the art of engraving so hard a jewel but says tavernier i did not dare to own to whom it belonged remembering what had formerly happened to the chevalier de reville on the subject of that king the story as he had related it before in book ii chap  0 was that reville having told the sophy that he had commanded a company of guards in the service of charles and being asked why he came into persia replied that it was to dissipate the chagrin he felt on his master being put to death and that since that time he could not endure to live in christendom the sophy fell into a rage and asked reville how it was possible if he was captain of the kings guards that he and all his men should not have shed the last drop of their blood in defense of their prince reville was thrown into prison and remained there    days and escaped at last by the intercession of the sophys eunuchs  had all charless soldiers been as loyal as the persian monarch thought it their duty to be we might now have the glory of being as faithful slaves as the asiatics   a catalogue of the pictures statues goods tapestries and jewels with the several prices at which they were valued and sold was discovered some years ago in moorfields and fell into the hands of the late sir john stanley who permitted mr vicechamberlain cook mr fairfax and mr kent to take copies from one of which virtue obtained a transcript the particulars are too numerous to insert here the total of the contracts amounted to    0 0 l   0 s    d thirty one pages at the beginning relating to the plate and jewels were wanting and other pages here and there were missing large quantities were undoubtedly secreted and embezzled and part remained unsold by the accession of cromwell who lived both at whitehall and hampton court all other furniture from all the kings palaces was brought up and exposed to sale there are specified particularly denmark or somerset house greenwich among the pictures from greenwich is mentioned one piece of writing by holbein sold for ten pounds i know not what this writing was whitehall nonsuch oatlands windsor wimbletonhouse st jamess hampton court richmond theobalds ludlow carisbrook and kenelworth castles bewdleyhouse holdenbyhouse royston newmarket and woodstock manorhouse one may easily imagine that such a collection of pictures with the remains of jewels and plate and the furniture of nineteen palaces ought to have amounted to a far greater sum than an hundred and eighteen thousand pounds r symonds says the committee of somerset house prized the kings goods and movables with the pictures at  00000 l notwithstanding the queen had carried away and himself caused to be conveyed away abundance of jewels and for this he cites beauchamp clerk to the committee   the sale continued to august        the prices were fixed but if more was offered the highest bidder purchased this happened in some instances not in many part of the goods were sold by inch of candle the buyers called contractors signed a writing for the several sums if they disliked the bargain they were at liberty to be discharged from the agreement on paying one fourth of the sum stipulated among the purchasers of statues and pictures were several painters as decritz wright baptist van leemput sir balthazar gerbier etc the prices of the most remarkable lots were as follows the cartoons of raphael  00 l bought by his highness cromwell the royal family now in the gallery at kensington   0 l the king on horseback in the same place  00 l the triumphs of julius caesar by andrea mantegna now at hampton court  000 l twelve caesars by titian   00 l the muses by tintoret at kensington valued at  0 l sold for  00 l alexander vi and caesar

the   th are sold to the right hon the lady cromwell goods to the amount of two hundred pounds more but no sooner was cromwell in possession of the sole power than he not only prevented any farther sale but even detained from the purchasers much of what they had contracted for this appears by a copied by virtue from a paper in possession of mr martin petition addressed after the protectors death to the council of state by major edward bass emanuel de critz william latham and henry willet in behalf of themselves and diverse others in which they represent  that in the year      the petitioners did buy of the contractors for the sale of the late kings goods the several parcels there undernamed and did accordingly make satisfaction unto the treasurer for the same but for as much as the said goods are in whitehall and some part thereof in mr kinnersleys custody in keeping the petitioners do humbly desire their honors order whereby they may receive the said goods they having been great sufferers by the late general cromwells detaining thereof and the petitioners etc  the goods specified are hangings and statues in the garden at whitehall it is very remarkable that in this piece they style the protector the late general cromwell  whence charles had his statues we learn from peacham the king also says he ever since his coming to the crown has amply testified a royal liking of ancient statues by causing a whole army of old foreign emperors captains and senators all at once to land on his coasts to come and do him homage and attend him in palaces of st jamess and somerset house a great part of these belonged to the late duke of mantua and some of the old greek marble bases columns and altars were brought from the ruins of apollos temple at delos by that noble and absolutely complete gentleman sir kenelm digby knight complete gentleman  0    some of the most capital pictures were purchased by the king of spain which arriving there while the ambassadors of charles ii were at that court they were desired by an odd kind of delicacy to withdraw they supposing that this dismission was owing to an account received at the same time of cromwells victory over the marquis of argyle but says lord clarendon in his life p     fol edit they knew afterward that the true cause of this impatience to get rid of them was that their minister in england having purchased many of the kings pictures and rich furniture had sent them to the groyne from whence they were expected to arrive about that time at madrid which they thought could not decently be brought to the palace while the ambassadors remained at the court  after the restoration endeavors were used to reassemble the spoils a commission was issued out to examine hugh peters concerning the disposal of the pictures jewels etc that had belonged to the royal family but without effect by the obstinacy or ignorance of peters who would not or could not give the desired satisfaction see general dict vol ii p     some of the pictures had been purchased by gerard reyntz they are engraved in reyntzs gallery a dutch collector after whose death they were bought of his widow by the states and presented to charles ii one only picture the king on horseback by vandyck was recovered by a process at law from remee or remigius van leemput a painter then in england who had bought it at the sale  notwithstanding the havoc that had been made it is plain from the catalogue of the collection of james ii that the crown still possessed a great number of valuable pictures but the fire of whitehall destroyed almost all that the rage of civil war had spared some valuable pieces indeed were carried to lisbon from somerset house by the queen dowager when she returned to portugal the then lord chamberlain it is said put a stop to their embarkation till mollified by the present of one of them that he admired  the royal library escaped better this was founded by james i it contained the collection belonging to the crown among which were several fine editions on vellom sent as presents from abroad on the restoration of learning to henry vii henry viii and queen elizabeth the library of the lord lumley purchased by james for prince henry the collection of casaubon bought of his widow and some curious mss brought from constantinople by sir thomas roe these books have been given to

desired and authorized to take upon him the care and custody of the library at jameshouse and of all the books manuscripts and medals that are in or belonging to the said library that the same be safely kept and preserved and to recover all such as have been embezzled or taken out of the same charles ii after his return ordered ashmole memoires of el ashmole prefixed to his berkshire p  0    to draw up an account of the medals that were left and placed them in the closet of henry viii at whitehall where they were lost at the fire  what farther relates to charles i as protector of the arts will be found in the subsequent pages under the articles of the different professors whom he countenanced if this chapter has not been thought tedious and too circumstantial the readers who excuse it will not perhaps be sorry if i add a little more to it on that other patron of genius the earl of arundel  there is a short view of his life in sir edward walkers historical discourses and some curious particulars in lillys observations on the life and death of king charles as the book is not in every bodys hands one anecdote may be worth transcribing the king taking the part of a priest who pretended that his majesty had a right to a rectory which the earl challenged as his arundel said to charles sir this rectory was an appendent to a manor of mine until my grandfather unfortunately lost both his life and seventeen lordships more for the love he bore to your grandmother p    thomas howard earl of arundel is sufficiently known in his public character by that admirable portrait drawn of him by lord clarendon living much within himself but in all the state of the ancient nobility his chief amusement was his collection the very ruins of which are ornaments now to several principal cabinets he was the first who professedly began to collect in this country and led the way to prince henry king charles and the duke of buckingham i cannot says peacham complete gentleman p  0  but with much reverence mention the every way right honorable thomas howard lord high marshal of england as great for his noble patronage of arts and ancient learning as for his high birth and place to whose in one of r symondess pocketbooks in the museum is a character not quite so favorable of the earl may says he rimunero persona era molto generoso e libero a forastieri per guadagnare

admired presence he began to honor the gardens and galleries of arundelhouse about twenty this was printed in      years ago and has ever since continued to transplant old greece into england the person chiefly employed by the earl in these researches was mr petty it appears from sir thomas roes letters who had a commission of the like nature from the duke of buckingham neither am i says the duke so fond of antiquity as you rightly conjecture to court it in a deformed or misshapen stone page     that no man was ever better qualified for such an employment than mr petty he encounters says sir thomas page     see the particulars of several purchases made by sir thomas and mr petty in various letters in that collection they are worth reading all accidents with unwearied patience eats with greeks on their workdays lies with fishermen on planks is all things that may obtain his ends mr petty returning with his collection from samos narrowly escaped with his life in a great storm but lost all his curiosities and was imprisoned for a spy but obtaining his liberty pursued his searches  many curious pieces of painting and antiquities especially medals the earl bought of henry vanderborcht a painter of brussels who lived at frankendal and whose son henry lord arundel finding at frankfort sent to mr petty then collecting for him in italy and afterward kept in his service as long as he lived vanderborcht the younger was both painter and graver he drew many of the arundelian curiosities and etched several things both in that and the royal collection a book of his drawings from the former containing     pieces is preserved at paris and is described in the catalogue of lorangerie p     after the death of the earl the younger henry entered into the service of the prince

enough and which if he had not left better proofs would give one as little opinion of the judgment of the speaker as it does of that of the relator the earl seems to have had in his service another

the just boldness of his drawing the wonderful chiaro scuro diffused throughout his pictures and not loaded like rembrandts to force out one peculiar spot of light the variety of his carnations the fidelity to the customs and manners of the times he was representing and attention to every part of his compositions without enforcing trifles too much or too much neglecting them all this union of happy excellencies endear the works of rubens to the best judges he is perhaps the single artist who attracts the suffrages of every rank one may justly call him the sr peter paul rubens t chambars sculp  popular painter he wanted that majesty and grace which confine the works of the greatest masters to the fewest admirers i shall be but brief on the circumstances of his life he staid but little here in which light only he belongs to this treatise  this extract is chiefly made from felibien vol iii p  0  from descamps p     and sandrart his father was doctor of laws and senator of antwerp which he quitted on the troubles of that country and retired with his family to cologn where on the feast of st peter and paul his wife was delivered of rubens in      great care was taken of his education he learned and spoke latin in perfection when antwerp was reduced by the arms of philip rubens the father returned to his native country the son was grown up and was well made the countess of lalain took him for her page but he had too elevated a disposition to throw away his talents on so dissipated a way of life he quitted that service and his father being dead his mother consented to let him pursue his passion for painting toby verhaest a landscapepainter and adam van oort were his first masters and then otho venius under whom he imbibed one of his least merits a taste for allegory the perplexed and silly emblems of venius are well known rubens with nobler simplicity is perhaps less just in his one may call some of his pictures a toleration of all religions in one of the compartments of the luxemburgh gallery a cardinal introduces mercury to mary de medici and hymen supports her train at the sacrament of marriage before an altar on which are the images of god the father and christ see more on this subject at the end of mr spences polymetis at the age of twentythree rubens set out for italy and entered into the service of vincent gonzaga duke of mantua one day while he was at that court and was painting the story of turnus and aeneas intending to warm his imagination by the rapture of poetry he repeated with energy those lines of virgil no wonder his emulation was raised at mantua where the works of homer were treated by raphael and julio romano ille etiam patriis agmen ciet etc the duke who over heard him and entered the chamber was surprised to find the mind of his painter cultivated with a variety of graceful litterature rubens was named envoy to spain and carried magnificent presents to the favorite duke of lerma exerting at that court his political and elegant talents with a dignity and propriety that raised the latter without debasing the former he conversed little with the painters of that country except velasquez with whom he continued a correspondence of letters  the fame of the young painter reached don john of braganza afterward king of portugal who invited him to villa viciosa rubens set out with such a train that the duke apprehended the expense of entertaining so pompous a visitor and wrote to stop his journey accompanying the excuse with a present of fifty pistoles the painter refused the present said he had not proposed to paint but to pass a week at villa viciosa and had brought a thousand pistoles that he intended to spend there  returned to mantua the duke sent him to rome to copy the works of the great masters there he studied them not what they had studied the ancients rubens was too careless of the antique as poussin copied it too servilely the former seemed never to have seen a statue the latter nothing else the reputation of titian and paul veronese drew rubens to venice there he was in his element in the empire of colors there he learned to imitate nature at rome he had missed the art of improving on it if he has not the simplicity of titian he has far more than paul veronese the buildings with which he has enriched the back grounds of his compositions do not yield to those of the latter his landscapes are at least equal to those of the former seldom as he practiced it rubens was never greater than in landscape the tumble of his rocks and trees the deep shadows in his glades and glooms the watery sunshine and dewy verdure show a variety of genius which are not to be found in the inimitable but uniform glow of claud lorrain  rubens was much worse employed at genoa where he drew most of their palaces and caused them to be engraved in two volumes how could a genius like his overlook the ruins of rome the designs of raphael and michael angelo and the restorers of ancient architecture at venice and waste his time on the very moderate beauties that he found at genoa where their greatest art lay in crowding magnificence into a narrow and almost useless situation where most of their palaces can only be seen from a sedan chair  his mothers illness drew him back to antwerp where the archduke albert detained him and where he married his first wife elizabeth brants he built a palace and painted it within and without his cabinet or rotunda was enriched with antique vases statues medals and pictures the duke of buckingham saw and coveted it le blond whom i have mentioned in the life of holbein negotiated the bargain to which rubens consented with regret the favorite who was bent on the purchase gave it is said ten thousand pounds for what had not cost above a thousand  in flanders he executed many great works which created him as many enemies they affected to ascribe to the scholars whom he had formed or been forced to take to assist him as jordaens van uden snyder and wildens the merits of the master  but the greater the talents of the assistants the higher the genius of the master do able painters work under an indifferent one abraham janssens challenged rubens to a trial of their art rubens replied he would engage with him when janssens had proved himself worthy to be his competitor a more friendly offer was rejected by him with equal wit a chemist tendered him a share of his laboratory and of his hopes of the philosophers stone rubens carried the visionary into his painting room and told him his offer was dated twenty years too late for so long it is said he since i found the art of making gold with my pallet and pencils  from antwerp he was called to paris by mary de medici and painted the ostensible history of her life in the luxemburgh it is said that she designed he should fill another gallery with the story of henry iv her husband and that he had begun several of the compartments but the troubles of that princess prevented the execution abrege de la vie des peintres vol ii p     a peculiar honor as that princess was an italian it is even said that he gave her some lessons in drawing if the prodigious number of large pieces painted by rubens were not testimonies of the abundance and facility of his genius this gallery alone completed in three years would demonstrate it as soon as it was finished he returned to antwerp where his various talents were so conspicuous that he was pitched upon to negotiate a treaty of peace between spain and england the infanta isabella sent him to madrid for instructions where he ingratiated himself so much with the condedue dolivarez that besides many valuable presents he had a brevet for himself and his son of secretary of the privy council and was dismissed with a secret commission to king charles as i have mentioned before in which he had the honor of succeeding  neither charles nor rubens overlooked in the ambassador the talents of the painter the king engaged him to paint the cieling of the banqueting house the design is the apotheosis of king james for whom when once deified there seems to have been no farther thought of erecting a monument the original sketch for the middle compartment is preserved at houghton it had belonged to sir godfrey kneller who often studied it as is evident by sir godfreys original sketch at houghton too for the great equestrian picture of king william at hampton court though in the larger piece he seems to have forgot that he ever had studied the former design sir godfrey had heard that jordaens assisted rubens in the execution if true some of the compartments must have been painted in holland and sent over hither for i do not find that jordaens was ever in england rubens received three thousand pounds for his work the building itself cost seventeen thousand pounds what had it been if completed vandyck was to have painted the sides with the history of the order of the garter inigo jones rubens and vandyck europe could not have shown a nobler chamber kent in the late reign repaired the painting on the cieling  during his residence here rubens painted for the king a st george in a letter in the museum dated march      0 it is said my lord carlisle has twice in one week most magnificently feasted the spanish ambassador and mons rubens also the agent who prepared the way for his coming who in honor of our nation has drawn with his pencil the history of st george wherein if it be possible he has exceeded himself but the picture he has sent home into flanders to remain as a monument of his abode and employment here this i suppose was a repetition of the picture he drew for the king one of them is now in the collection of the earl of lincoln four feet high and seven feet

peter lely five see their catalogues by bathoe the duchess of marlborough gave any price for his pictures they there are sixteen pieces by this master the best are his own portrait with his wife and child the offering of the magi and the roman charity are the first ornaments of blenheim but have suffered by neglect at wilton are two one the assumption of the virgin painted for the earl of arundel while rubens was in england and with which he was so pleased himself that he afterward made a large picture from it for a convent at antwerp the other contains four children christ an angel st john and a girl representing the church this picture which is far superior to the foregoing and very fine is said in the catalogue to be allowed to be the best picture in england of rubens an hyperbole indeed see kennedys account of wilton p       at the earl of pomfrets at easton was a portrait of lodowic duke of richmond and lenox at houghton is that masterly piece mary magdalen anointing the feet of christ and a large cartoon of meleager and atalanta there too are three pieces in three different styles in each of which he excelled a landscape and satyrs and lions animals especially of the savage kind he painted beyond any master that ever lived in his satyrs though highly colored and with characteristic countenances he wanted poetic imagination they do not seem a separate species but a compound of the human and animal in which each part is kept too distinct his female satyrs are scarce more indelicate than his women one would think that like swift he did not intend that yahoos should be too discriminate from human nature though what the satyrist drew from spleen flowed in the painter from an honest love of flesh and blood there are besides in lord orfords collection the sketches for the cardinal infants entry into antwerp the family of rubens by his scholar jordaens and his second wife helena forman a celebrated whole length by vandyck  the fine picture of st martin the late prince of wales bought of mr bagnol who brought it from spain it is remarkable that in this piece rubens has borrowed the head of an old man from the cripple in one of the cartoons of which i have said he gave information to king charles who purchased them at lord spencers at wimbleton is a fine portrait of cardinal howard at burleigh is an ebony cabinet the front and sides of which are painted by rubens at one end are his three wives highly colored  i do not find how long rubens stayed in england probably not above a year he died of the gout in his own country in    0 a catalogue of his works may be seen in descamps see also a list of the works of rubens in le comtes cabinet des singularitez d architecture peinture etc vol i p     there are forty six pieces painted by him in the

antiquaries some years ago a ms containing discourses and observations on human bodies and on the statues and paintings of the ancients and moderns written partly in latin partly in italian and some notes in dutch and illustrated with several drawings as heads attitudes proportions etc habits of greeks and romans various instruments utensils armor and headdresses from coins and statues and comparisons of raphael michael angelo and others it was an octavo pocketbook and appeared to be an exact copy of rubenss album which he used in his travels the drawings and even handwriting and different inks being exactly imitated this book was brought from brussels by capt johnson mr johnsons son and had one leaf of the original in it with a sketch of the head of the farnesian hercules the original itself is at paris where they intended to publish it an account of it is given in the catalogue raisonne de monsieur quintin de lorangerie par frederic gersaint       abraham diepenbeck  among the various scholars of rubens was one of the few that came to england where he was much employed by william cavendish duke of newcastle whose managed horses he drew from the life from whence were engraved the cuts that adorn that peers book of horsemanship several of the original pictures still remain in the hall at welbeck diepenbeck drew views of the dukes seats in nottinghamshire and derbyshire and portraits of the duke duchess and his children and gave designs for several plates prefixed to the works of both their graces diepenbeck says de piles was born at boisleduc and in his youth was much employed in painting upon glass sandrart says he excelled all the other painters on glass and entering afterward into the school of rubens became one of his best disciples several prints were made from his works particularly those he designed for a book called the temple of the muses engraved by bloemart and mattham in      sandrart see a farther account of diepenbeck in the abrege de la vie des plus fameux peintres vol ii p     at cashiobury is the story of dido and aeneas by him sir r walpole had another but smaller and his portraits of lessius and bellarmine by bolsvert v evelyns sculptura p    and of sir hugh cartwright      by vosterman  sir antony vandyck  whose works are so frequent in england that the generality of our people can scarce avoid thinking him their countryman was born at antwerp in      the only son of a merchant and of a mother who was admired for painting flowers in small and for her needleworks in silk vandyck was first placed with van balen who had studied at rome and painted figures both in large and small but the fame of rubens drew away to a nobler school the young congenial artist the progress of the disciple speedily raised him to the glory of assisting in the works from which he learned fame that always supposes jealousy is felt where there are grounds for it attributes to rubens an envy of which his liberal nature i believe was incapable and makes him advise vandyck to apply himself chiefly to portraits i shall show that jealousy at least emulation is rather to be ascribed to the scholar than to the master if rubens gave the advice in question he gave it with reason not maliciously vandyck had a peculiar genius for portraits his draperies his sattins of which he was fond particularly white and blue are remarkably finished his backgrounds heavy and have great sameness are finished with a minuteness of truth not demanded in historic compositions besides his invention was cold and tame nor does he any where seem to have had much idea of the passions and their expression portraits require none if rubens had been jealous of vandyck would he as all their biographers agree he did persuade him to visit italy whence himself had drawn his greatest lights addison did not advise pope to translate homer but assisted tickell in a rival translation vandyck after making presents to rubens of two or antony vandyck  pinx  bannerman sculp  from an original in the collection of the   three histories and the famous portrait of the latters wife set out for italy and made his first residence at genoa from thence he went to venice which one may call the metropolis of the flemish painters who seem so naturally addicted to coloring that even in italy they see only with flemish eyes vandyck imbibed so deeply the tints of titian that he is allowed to approach nearer to the carnations of that master even than rubens sir anthony had more delicacy than the latter but like him never reached the grace and dignity of the antique he seldom even arrived at beauty his madonnas are homely his ladies so little flattered that one is surprised he had so much custom he has left us to wonder that the famous countess of carlisle could be thought so charming and had not waller been a better painter sacharissa would make little impression now one excellence he had which no portraitpainter ever attained except sir godfrey kneller the hands are often the finest part of his pictures  he went to rome and lived splendidly avoiding the low conversation of his countrymen and distinguished by the appellation of the pittore cavalieresco it was at rome he drew that capital portrait of cardinal bentivoglio who having been nuncio in flanders had a partiality for their artists and as he celebrated their history with his pen was in return almost immortalized by one of their best pencils  vandyck while at rome received an invitation to palermo and went thither there he painted prince philibert of savoy the viceroy and a paintress of some name at the lord spensers at wimbledon is a good portrait of sophonisba anguisciola playing on a harpsichord painted by herself and an old woman attending her on the picture is written jussu patris lord ashburnham has a small head of her in a round sophonisba anguisciola then at the age of ninetyone but the plague soon drove him from sicily he returned to genoa where he had gained the highest reputation and where he has left many considerable works  he went back to antwerp and practiced both history and portrait of the former kind were many applauded altarpieces in the latter were particularly the heads of his cotemporary artists he drew them in chiaro scuro on small pannels thirtyfive of which are in the collection of the countess of cardigan at whitehall admirable is the variety of attitudes and airs of heads but in those pieces he meaned to surpass as well as record the whole collection has been thrice published the first edition by vanden enden contains fourscore plates the second by giles hendrix one hundred the last by verdussen who effaced the names and letters of the original engravers some of the plates were etched by vandyck himself i say nothing of the numbers of prints from his other works  hearing of the favor king charles showed to the arts vandyck came to england and lodged with his friend geldorp a painter hoping to be introduced to the king it is extraordinary he was not he went away chagrined but his majesty soon learning what a treasure had been within his reach ordered sir kenelm digby who had sat to vandyck to invite him over he came and was lodged among the kings artists at blackfryars which felibien according to the dignity of ignorance which the french affect calls lhotel de blaifore vol iii page     thither the king went often by water and viewed his performances with singular delight frequently sitting to him himself and bespeaking pictures of the queen his children and his courtiers and conferring the honor of knighthood the french author of the lives of the painters says he was created knight of the bath a mistake abrege vol ii p   0 another mistake is his supposing that vandyck was only to give designs for tapestries in the banqueting house p     on him at st jamess july        this was soon attended by the grant of an annuity of  00 l a year for life the patent is preserved in the rolls and dated      in which he is styled painter to his majesty i have already mentioned the jealousy of mytens on this occasion  of the various portraits by vandyck of king charles the principal are a whole length in the coronation robes at hampton court in the same palace are whole lengths of james i his queen the queen of bohemia and prince henry copied by vandyck from painters of the preceding reign prince henrys is in armor in which vandyck excelled has an amiable countenance and is a fine picture the head has been engraved by virtue among the kings of england another in armor on a dun horse at blenheim this was in the royal collection was sold in the civil war and was bought by the duke of marlborough from munich a whole length in armor at houghton another a large piece at the duke of graftons in which the king a most graceful figure in white satin with his hat on is just descended from his horse at a distance a view of the isle of wight the this is the picture that was recovered from remee king in armor on a white horse mons de st antoine he had been a chief equerry to prince henry and led a mourning horse at his funeral see birchs life of that prince append     his equerry holding his helmet the head of the latter is fine the kings is probably not an original this and the following are at each end of the gallery at kensington the king and queen sitting prince charles very young standing at his knee the duke of york an infant on hers this picture has been heightened to make it match it is opposite at turin is another whole length of the king in a large piece of architecture at somerset house the king and queen half lengths holding a crown of laurel between them at windsor is a beautiful half length of the queen in white many portraits of her pretend to be by vandyck but none are so lovely as this he two or three times drew prince charles in armor standing at kensington in one piece are prince charles prince james and the princess mary lately engraved by strange in the same palace is one of his finest works george villiers the second duke of buckingham and lord francis his brother when children nothing can exceed the nature luster and delicacy of this sweet picture at houghton are two young daughters of the lord wharton admirable too but rather inferior to the foregoing in lord orfords collection are several principal works see a particular description of these pictures in the aedes walpolianae of this master the holy family with a dance of angels it belonged to king charles is a capital picture but has it is faults inigo jones a head rubenss wife in black satin henry danvers earl of danby whole length in the robes of the garter and a half length of sir thomas chaloner governor of prince henry besides these my father bought of the last duke the whole collection of the wharton family there were twelve whole lengths the two girls six half lengths and two more by sir peter lely he paid an hundred pounds each for the whole lengths and the double picture and fifty pounds each for the half lengths most of them were carried to houghton but some not suiting the places were brought back and sold for a trifle after the death of my father those that remain are king charles the queen very indifferent sir thomas wharton of the half lengths laud a celebrated but not very fine picture sir christopher wandesford lady wharton mrs wharton mrs wenman and the lelys the rest were lord wharton bought by lord royston lady wharton in white lady chesterfield ditto countess of worcester in blue lady rich in black very handsome on whose death waller wrote a poem mrs smith in blue a homely woman but a fine picture now mine lady carlisle bought by mr west arthur goodwin father of mrs smith one of the best given by my father to the late duke of devonshire and two portraits of prince rupert whole and half lengths both very poor performances some of the whole lengths were engraved by van gunst   at cornbury the seat of the earls of clarendon in oxfordshire was a noble collection of portraits of the principal persons in the reign of king charles many of which were drawn by vandyck the collection has since been divided between the duchess of queensberry lady hyde and lady mary forbes the heiresses of the family several others of his works are at the earl of denbighs and at lord spensers at althrop among the latter a celebrated double whole length of the first duke of bedford and the famous lord digby afterward earl of bristol the whole figure of the latter is good and both the heads fine the body of bedford is flat nor is this one of his capital works here too is a good picture of daedalus and icarus half lengths a fine surly impatience in the young man and his body well colored the duke of devonshire has some good pictures by him at chiswick is the well known lord burlington gave  000 l for this picture at paris and had another of luca jordano into the bargain belisarius though very doubtful if by the hand of vandyck the expressive figure of the young soldier redeems this picture from the condemnation it would deserve by the principal figure being so mean and inconsiderable the duke has vandycks traveling pocketbook in which are several sketches particularly from titian and of sophonisba anguisciola mentioned above  at holkham is a large equestrian picture of a count daremberg both the rider and horse are in his best manner and at earl cowpers a large piece of john count of nassau and his family lately engraved by baron  mr skinner with the collection of the late mr thomas walker has a fine little picture of the lady venetia digby wife of sir kenelm though only a model for the large one at windsor it is exquisitely finished she is represented as treading on envy and malice and is unhurt by a serpent that twines round her arm this galant compliment is a little explained in the new life of lord clarendon who mentions sir kenelms marriage with a lady though of an extraordinary beauty of as extraordinary fame there is an elegy and epitaph on this lady in randolphs poems page    in which her beauty is exceedingly commended she was daughter and coheiress of sir edward stanley grandson of edward earl of derby by the lady lucy percy daughter of thomas earl of northumberland lady venetia was found dead in her bed sir kenelm erected for her a monument of black marble with her bust in copper gilt and a lofty epitaph in christchurch without newgate but it was destroyed in the fire of london lodges peerage of ireland vol iv p    there are two copper busts of the lady venetia extant at mr wrights at gothurst in buckinghamshire with several portraits of the family of digby the house belonged to sir kenelm and was purchased by sir nathan wright mr walkers collection was chiefly chosen for him by a set of virtuosi called vandycks or the club of st luke and it is plain from the pictures they recommended that they understood what they professed there was another large piece of sir kenelm his lady and two children in the collection of the earl of oxford and a fine half length of sir kenelm alone is at kensington vandyck painted too for the king a twelfth roman emperor to complete the set of titian in the room of one which was spoiled and left at mantua they cost the king  00 l a piece and after his death were bought by the spanish ambassador the first purchaser of those effects as the kings collection was embezzled or taken by his servants for their arrears that minister laid out  00 l in those purchases with harrison possibly the person mentioned p    the kings embroiderer by somerset house and of murray his tailor he bought a half figure of a venus these and many other notices are taken from the pocketbooks of richard symonds of blacknotley in essex gent who was born at okehampton and was in the army of king charles during the civil war writing memoires of battles actions motions and promotions of officers from time to time in small pocketbooks and through the several counties he passed memorandums of churches monuments painted windows arms inscriptions etc till january        when he left london and traveled first to paris and then to rome and venice always continuing his memoires where he stayed till his return to england in      eight or ten of these books were in the harleian library two in that of dr meade and two or three in the heralds office where is the pedigree of his family with his picture probably in red wax from a seal engraved by t simon his namesake but no relation the flemings gave any price for the works of vandyck from that collection sir peter lely as may be seen in his catalogue had several capital ones  but it is at the earl of pembrokes at wilton that vandyck is on his throne the great salon is entirely furnished by his hand there is that principal picture of earl philip and his family which though damaged would serve alone as a school of this master yet with great admiration of him i cannot but observe how short he falls of his model titian what heads both of age and youth are in the family of cornaro at northumberlandhouse how happily is the disposition of a religious act chosen to throw expression into a groupe of portraits it is said that the earl of pembroke had obtained leave to have a piece of the whole royal family by the same hand as a companion to his own  at leicesterhouse is a double portrait bought by the late prince of wales of mr bagnols it represents two of the wits of that time t carew of the privychamber to charles i and a poet and henry killigrew they had a remarkable dispute before mrs cecilia crofts sister of the lord crofts to which virtue supposed this picture alluded as in a play called the wanderer was a song against jealousy written on the same occasion  i have reserved to the last i have here as in the case of holbein mentioned only the capital pieces or those which being in great collections are most easy of access i do not pretend to enumerate all that are or are called of this master the mention of the finest picture in my opinion of this master it is of the earl of strafford and his secretary at the marquis of rockinghams at wentworthhouse in yorkshire i can forgive him any insipid portraits of perhaps insipid people when he showed himself capable of conceiving and transmitting the idea of the greatest man of the age there is another of these pictures at blenheim but infinitely inferior  in the cathedral of gloucester are two cumbent figures of an alderman and his wife evidently wrought from a design of vandyck it is great pity the sculptor is not known so successfully has he executed the manner of the painter the figures even in that tasteless attitude are easy and graceful and the draperies have a peculiar freedom sanderson a quaint writer uses a phrase which though affected is expressive he says vandyck was the first painter who ere put ladies dress into a careless romance graphice p      vandyck had  0 l for a half and  0 l for a whole length a more rational proportion than that of our present painters who receive an equal price for the most insignificant part of the picture  he was indefatigable this is evident by the number of his works for though he was not above fortytwo when he died they are not exceeded by those of rubens and keeping a great table often detained the persons who sat to him to dinner for an opportunity of studying their countenances and of retouching their pictures again in the afternoon sir peter lely told mrs beale that laniere assured him he had sat seven entire days to him morning and evening and that notwithstanding vandyck would not once let him look at the picture till he was content with it himself this was the portrait that determined the king to invite him to england a second time it is at the seat of the lord chancellor henley at the grange in hampshire   in the summer he lived at eltham in kent in an old house there said to have been his virtue saw several sketches of stories from ovid in two colors ascribed to him  at the duke of graftons is a fine half length of i have a fine sketch of the sace only by himself vandyck by himself when young holding up his arm the hand declined there is a print of it and of two others of him older one looking over his shoulder the other with a sunflower at hampton court in the apartment below is his from the minutes of the antiquarian society i find that in      they were informed that at mr isaac ewers in lincolnsinnfields was a copy by vanderbank of thurloes portrait painted by mr churchills pupil mistress to vandyck this person i suppose was mrs carlisle mentioned hereafter but of churchill i have seen no other account mistress mrs lemon highly finished there is a print of the same person by hollar but not from this picture in the pocketbook of r symonds that i have mentioned he says it was much wondered at that he vandyck should openly keep a mistress of his mrs lemon in the house and yet suffer porter to keep her company this was endymion porter of the bedchamber to king charles of whom and his family there was a large piece by vandyck at buckinghamhouse see a list of vandycks works in le comtes cabinet des singularitez d architecture peinture etc vol i p     many are in the gallery at dusseldorp   he was much addicted to his pleasures and expense i have mentioned how well he lived he was fond of music and generous to musicians his luxurious and sedentary life brought on the gout and hurt his fortune he sought to repair it not like his master by the laboratory of his painting room but by that real folly the pursuit of the philosophers stone in which perhaps he was encouraged by the example or advice of his friend sir kenelm digby toward the end of his life the king bestowed on him for a wife mary the daughter of the unfortunate lord gowry which if meaned as a signal honor might be calculated too to depress the disgraced family by connecting them with the blood of a painter it is certain that the alliance does not seem to have attached vandyck more strongly to the king whether he had any disgusts infused into him by his new wife or whether ambitious as i have hinted of vying with the glory of his master in the luxemburg sir antony soon after his marriage set out for paris in hopes of being employed there in some public work he was disappointed he was not totally unemployed there sir richard lyttelton has two small pictures in chiaro scuro evidently designed for altarpieces and representing anne of austria and some monkish saint  their own poussin was then deservedly the favorite at that court vandyck returned to england and in the same humor of executing some public work and that in competition with his master he proposed to the king by sir kenelm digby to paint the walls of the banqueting house of which the cieling was already adorned by rubens with the history and procession of the order of the garter the proposal struck the kings taste and by a small sketch now at the lord chancellor henleys at the grange in hampshire in chiaro scuro for the procession in which though very faint some portraits are distinguishable it looks as if it had been accepted though some say it was rejected on the extravagant price demanded by vandyck i would not specify the sum it is so improbable if i did not find it repeated in fentons notes on waller it was fourscore thousand pounds the civil war prevented farther thoughts of it as the death of vandyck would have interrupted the execution at least the completion of it he died in blackfryars december        and was buried on the   th in st pauls near the tomb of john of gaunt  by maria ruthven his wife he left one daughter married to mr stepney a gentleman who rode in the horseguards on their first establishment by charles ii their grandson mr stepney was envoy to several courts and is known by his poems published in the collection of the works of our minor poets sir john stepney another descendent died on the road from bath to wales in      lady vandyck the widow was married again to richard pryse son of sir john pryse of newtonaberbecham in montgomeryshire knight richard who was created a baronet august        was first married to hesther daughter of sir hugh middleton by vandycks widow he had no issue virtue ascertained these matches by books in the college os arms   besides his legitimate children vandyck had a natural daughter called maria teresa to whom as appears by his will in doctors commons he left four thousand pounds then in the hands of his sister susannah vandyck in a convent at antwerp whom he appoints trustee for that daughter to his sister isabella he bequeaths   0 guilders yearly and in case his daughter maria teresa die unmarried he entails  000 l on another sister married to mr derick and her children to his wife mary and his newborn daughter justiniana anna he gives all his goods effects and moneys due to him in england from king charles the nobility and all other persons whatever to be equally divided between them his executors are his wife mr aurelius de meghan and katherine cowley to which katherine he leaves the care of his daughter to be brought up allowing ten pounds per ann till she is eighteen years of age other legacies he gives to his executors and trustees for their trouble and three pounds each to the poor of st pauls and st annes blackfriars and to each of his servants male and female  the war prevented the punctual execution of his will the probate of which was not made till      when the heirs and executors from abroad and at home assembled to settle the accounts and recover what debts they could  but with little effect in      and in   0  the heirs with mr carbonnel who had married the daughter of vandycks daughter made farther inspections into his affairs and demands on his creditors but what was the issue does not appear  lady lempster mother of the last earl of pomfret who was at rome with her lord wrote a life of vandyck with some description of his works  sir kenelm digby in his discourses compares vandyck and hoskins and says the latter pleased the most by painting in little  waller has addressed a poem to vandyck beginning rare artisan lord halifax another on his portrait of lady sunderland printed in the third volume of state poems and cowley wrote an elegy on his death  among the scholars john de reyn a scholar of vandyck is said by descamps to have lived with his master in england till the death of the latter after which he was in france and settled at dunkirk if de reyns works are little known adds his biographer it is owing to their approaching so nearly to his masters as to be confounded with them vol ii p     of vandyck was the french author of the abrege says that gerard seghers came hither aster the deaths of rubens and vandyck and softened his manner here this is all the trace i find of his being in england vol ii p     at kensington is an indifferent piece of flowers by him but i do not know that it was painted here   david beck  born at arnheim in      he was in favor with charles i and taught the prince and the dukes of york and gloucester to draw descamps says that becks facility in composition was so great that charles i said to him faith beck i believe you could paint riding post vol ii p     he afterward went to france denmark and sweden and died in       george geldorp  of antwerp a countryman and friend of vandyck in whose house that painter lodged at his first arrival had been settled here some time before he could not draw himself but painted on sketches made by others and was in repute even by this artificial practice this must not be supposed to include his portraits for which he certainly would have had no custom if the persons had been obliged to sit to two different men a painter may execute a head though he cannot compass a whole figure a print by voerst of james stewart duke of lenox with geo geldorp pinx is indubitable proof that the latter painted portraits though virtue was told by mr rose that it was not his most lucrative employment his house being reckoned convenient for the intrigues of people of fashion he first lived in drury lane in a large house and garden rented from the crown at  0 l per ann and afterward in      in archerstreet he had been concerned in keeping the kings pictures and when sir peter lely first came over he worked for geldorp who lived till after the restoration and was buried at westminster another of the apprentices of geldorp was  isaac sailmaker  who was employed by cromwell to take a view of the fleet before mardyke a print of the confederate fleet under sir george rooke engaging the french commanded by the count de toulouse was engraved in      from a design of sailmaker who lived to the age of eightyeight and died june           bradshaw  was another painter in the reign of charles i whom i only mention with other obsolete names to lead inquirers to farther discoveries all i find of him is a note from one of the pocketbooks of r symonds abovementioned who says pierce in bishopgatestreet told me that bradshaw is the only man that does understand perspective of all the painters in london  b van bassen  of antwerp was a very neat painter of architecture in the private apartment below stairs at kensington are two pictures by him in one are represented charles i and his queen at dinner in the other the king and queen of bohemia distinguished by their initial letters f and e the duchess of portland has a magnificent lord oxford paid three hundred and ten pounds for it cabinet of ebony bought by her father the earl of oxford from the arundelian collection at tarthall on each of the drawers is a small history by polenburg and pieces of architecture in the manner of steenwyck by this van bassen who must not be confounded with the italian bassans nor with the bassanos who were musicians to charles and of which name there was also a heraldpainter the first bassano who came hither in the reign of queen elizabeth and was related to the italian painters of that name settled in essex and purchased an estate which was sold in      by the male descendent in the mansion was a portrait of the musician holding a bassviol it is now at narford in norfolk the seat of the late sir andrew fountain  cornelius polenburg  the sweet painter of little landscapes and figures was born at utrecht in      and educated under bloemart whom he soon quitted to travel to italy as he abandoned say our books the manner of elsheimer to study raphael  but it is impossible to say where they find raphael in polenburg the latter formed a style entirely new and though preferable to the flemish unlike any italian except in having adorned his landscapes with ruins there is a varnished smoothness and finishing in his pictures that makes them always pleasing though simple and too nearly resembling one another the roman cardinals were charmed with the neatness of his works so was the great duke but could not retain him he returned to utrecht and pleased rubens who had several of his performances king charles invited him to london where he lived in archerstreet next door to geldorp and generally painted the figures in steenwycks perspectives there is a very curious picture at earl poulets at hinton st george representing an inside view of theobalds with figures of the king queen and the two earls of pembroke and montgomery william and philip this piece is probably of steenwyck and the figures in king charless catalogue are mentioned the portraits of his majesty and of the children of the king of bohemia by polenburg and in king jamess are eight pieces by him which are copied from vandyck either of polenburg or van bassen  cornelius polenburg ipse pinx tchambars sculp    henry steenwyck ant van dyck pinx bannerman sculp    the works of polenburg are very scarce there are sixteen mentioned in the catalogue of james ii his scholar john de lis of breda imitated his manner so exactly that his pieces are often taken for the hand of his master the best picture in england of the latter is at the viscount midletons i have his own and his wifes portrait by him in small ovals on copper they were my fathers the wife is stiff and dutch his own is inimitable though worked up to the tender smoothness of enamel it has the greatest freedom of pencil the happiest delivery of nature  charles could not prevail on polenburg to fix here he returned to utrecht and died there in    0 at the age of seventyfour  henry steenwyck  was son descamps has proved that it is a mistake to call the son nicholas as sandrart and others have done see p     of the famous painter of architecture and learned that manner of his father i find no particulars of the time of his arrival here or when he died it is certain he worked for king charles in king jamess catalogue are recorded ten of his works the ground to the portrait of that prince in the royal palace at turin i believe was painted by him in france are the portraits of charles and his queen by him about a soot high in one piece with a front of a royal palace in the back ground descamps says this picture is more carefully labored than any work of vandyck and equal to the most valuable of mieris p     i believe the fine piece of architecture at houghton is by the hand of steenwyck the father by the son was a capital picture of st peter in prison which at streaters sale in      sold for    l it was afterward in dr meades collection who sold it to the late prince of wales in a ms catalogue of king charless collection is mentioned a perspective by steenwyck with the king and queen in little by belcamp in the same catalogue is recorded a little book of perspectives by steenwyck which on the sale of the kings goods sold for no more than two pounds ten shillings steenwycks name and the date      are on the picture of frobenius at kensington which he altered for king charles it is the portrait of the son that is among the heads of painters by vandyck his son nicholas was in england also painted for king charles and probably died here  john torrentius  of amsterdam is known to have been here not by his works but on the authority of schrevelius in his history of arlem from whom descamps took his account torrentius says the latter painted admirably in small but his subjects were not calculated to procure him many avowed admirers he painted from the lectures of petronius and aretine had the confidence to dogmatize on the same subjects and practiced at least what he preached to profligacy he added impiety till the magistrates thought proper to put a stop to his boldness he underwent the question and was condemned to an imprisonment of twenty years but obtained his liberty by the intercession of some men of quality and particularly of the english ambassador  what the name of the latter was we are not told torrentius came over to england but giving more scandal than satisfaction he returned to amsterdam and remained there concealed till his death in    0 aged fiftyone king charles had two pieces of his hand one representing two glasses of rhenish the other a naked man v catalogue p p           keirincx  called here carings was employed by king charles to draw views his works are mentioned in the royal catalogue particularly prospects of his majestys houses in scotland in a sale of pictures in march      was a landscape by him freely and brightly touched with his name written on it as above the french author of the abrege calls him alexander which must be a mistake he says he acquired his reputation by what should have destroyed it as he could not paint figures polenburg generally added them for him i have the view of a seat in a park by him freely painted not to say very carelessly it has king charless mark behind it and a few small figures added by polenburg in dagars sale were three drawings with a pen and washed by keirincx one of them had a view of the parliament house and westminster stairs to the water dated       john priwitzer  was too good a painter to remain so long unknown at woburn besides some young heads of the family is a whole length of sir william russel a youth and knight of the bath in the robes of the order with a dwarf aged thirtytwo it is painted with great brightness and neatness and does not want freedom upon it is written johannes priwitzerus de hungaria faciebat      i have never met with any other mention of this name  george jamesone the materials of this article were communicated by mr john jamisone winemerchant in leith who has another portrait of this painter by himself    inches by  0   was the vandyck of scotland to which title he had a double pretension not only having surpassed his countrymen as a portraitpainter but from his works being sometimes attributed to sir antony who was his fellowscholar both having studied under rubens at antwerp  jamesone was son of andrew jamesone an architect and was born at aberdeen in      at what age he went abroad or how long he continued there is not known after his return he applied with indefatigable industry to portrait in oil though he sometimes practiced in miniature and in history and landscape too his largest portraits his earliest works are chiefly on board afterward on a fine linen cloth smoothly primed with a proper tone to help the harmony of his shadows his best works were from    0 to his death were generally somewhat less than life his excellence is said to consist in delicacy and softness with a clear and beautiful coloring his shades not charged but helped by varnish with little appearance of the pencil there is a print of him his wife isabella tosh and a young son painted by himself in      engraved by alexander jamesone his descendent in      and now in the possession of mr john alexander limner at edinburgh his great grandson with several other george jamesone bannerman sculp  portraits of the family painted by george particularly another of himself in his school with sketches both of history and landscape and with portraits of charles  st his queen jamesones wife and four others of his works from the life  when king charles visited scotland in      the magistrates of edinburgh knowing his majestys taste employed jamesone to make drawings of the scottish monarchs with which the king was so much pleased that inquiring for the painter he sat to him and rewarded him with a diamond ring from his own finger  it is observable that jamesone always drew himself with his hat on either in imitation of his master rubens or on having been indulged in that liberty by the king when he sat to him  though most of the considerable families in scotland are possessed of works by this master the greatest collection of them is at taymouth the seat of the earl of breadalbane sir colin campbell of glenorchy his lordships ancestor having been the chief and earliest patron of jamesone who had attended that gentleman on his travels from a ms on vellom containing the genealogy of the house of glenorchy begun in      are taken the following extracts written in      page     item the said sir coline campbell  th lord of glenorchy gave unto george jamesone painter in edinburgh for king robert and king david bruysses kings of scotland and charles the  st king of great brittane france and ireland and his majestys quein and for nine more of the queins of scotland their portraits quhilks are set up in the hall of ballock now taymouth the sum of tua hundredth thrie scor punds  mair the said sir coline gave to the said george jamesone for the knight of lockows lady and the first countess of argylle and six of the ladys of glenurquhay their portraits and the said sir coline his own portrait quhilks are set up in the chalmer of deass of ballock ane hundredth four scoire punds  memorandum in the same year      the said george jamesone painted a large genealogical tree of the family of glenorchy   feet long and   broad containing in miniature the portraits of sir duncan campbell of lockow of archibald campbell his eldest son first earl of argylle and of sir coline campbell his second son first lord of glenorchy together with the portraits of eight successive knights lairds of glenorchy with the branches of their intermarriages and of those of their sons and daughters beautifully illuminated at the bottom of which tree the following words are painted on a scroll the genealogy of the house of glenurquhie whereof is descendit sundry nobill and worthy houses      amesone faciebat  besides the foregoing lord breadalbane has at taymouth by the same hand eleven portraits of lords and ladies of the first families in scotland painted in      and       from the extract above it appears that jamesone received no more for each of those heads than twenty pounds scots or one pound thirteen shillings and fourpence english yet it is proved by their public records that he died possessed of an easy fortune which he left to his three daughters two of whom were honorably married one of them named mary distinguished herself by admirable needlework a piece of which used to be exhibited on festivals in the church of st nicholas at aberdeen her descendent mr thomson of portlethem has an original picture of her father by himself three small portraits of the house of haddington are in the possession of thomas hamilton esquire of fala  many of jamesones works are in both colleges of aberdeen the sibyls there it is said he drew from living beauties of that city mr baird of auchmedden in aberdeenshire has in one piece three young ladies cousins of the houses of argyle errol and kinnoul their ages six seven and eight as marked on the side of the picture the same gentleman has a small whole length of william earl of pembroke by some ascribed to vandyck at mr lindsays of wormeston in fife is a double half length of two boys of that family playing with a dog their ages five and three       there is a perspective view of edinburgh by jamesone with a neptune on the fore ground  having finished a fine whole length of charles i he expected the magistrates of aberdeen would purchase it for their hall but they offering him too inconsiderable a price he sold it to a gentleman in the north of england  jamesone had many scholars particularly michael wright mentioned in the third volume of these anecdotes his own portrait is in the florentine chamber of painters  though jamesone is little known in england his character as well as his works were greatly esteemed in his own country arthur johnston the poet addressed to him an elegant epigram on the picture of the marchioness of huntley which may be seen in the works of that author printed at middleburgh in      the portrait itself is extant in the collection of the duke of gordon and in the newtoncollege of aberdeen is the picture of doctor johnston himself by the same hand a latin elegy composed by david wedderburn was printed on his death which happened in      at edinburgh where he was interred in the churchyard by the grayfriars but without any monument  by his will written with his own hand in july      and breathing a spirit of much piety and benevolence he provides kindly for his wife and children and leaves many legacies to his relations and friends particularly to lord rothes the kings picture from head to foot and mary with martha in one piece to william murray he gives the medals in his coffer makes a handsome provision for his natural daughter and bestows liberally on the poor that he should be in a condition to do all this seems extraordinary his prices having been so moderate for enumerating the debts due to him he charges lady haddington for a whole length of her husband and lady selons of the same dimensions frames and all but three hundred marks and lord maxwell for his own picture and his ladys to their knees one hundred marks both sums of scots money  mr jamisone so the name is now written not jamesone has likewise a memorandum written and signed by this painter mentioning a ms in his possession containing two hundred leaves of parchment of excellent write adorned with diverse historys of our savior curiously limned which he values at two hundred pounds sterling a very large sum at that time what is become of that curious book is not known  william dobson  whom king charles called the english tintoret was born in    0 in st andrews parish in holbourn his family had been gentlemen of dobson bannerman sculp  good rank at st albans but having fallen into decay he was put apprentice r symonds says he learned most of old cleyn to sir robert peake whom i have mentioned a painter and dealer in pictures under him though no excellent performer but by the advantage of copying some pictures of titian and vandyck dobson profited so much that a picture he had drawn being exposed in the window of a shop on snowhill vandyck passing by was struck with it and inquiring for the author found him at work in a poor garret from whence he took him and recommended him to the king on the death of vandyck dobson was appointed serjeantpainter and groom of the privychamber and attended the king to oxford and lodged in the high street almost over against st marys church in a house where some of his works remained till of late years at oxford his majesty prince rupert and several of the nobility the author of the abrege de la vie des plus fameux peintres says that dobson being overwhelmed with business thought of a lucky way to check it it was obliging persons who sat to him to pay half the price down and that he was the first who used this practice by the swarms of portraits that are left on the hands of his successors this method is either neglected or has very little effect sat to him but the declension of the kings affairs proved fatal to dobson he loved his pleasures and not having had time to enrich himself was involved in debts and thrown into prison from whence he was delivered by one mr vaughan of the exchequer whose picture he drew and thought it the best of his portraits he enjoyed this release but a short time dying at the age of thirtysix he was buried at st martins october         a short life in which he had promised much excellence his pictures are thought the best imitations of vandyck they are undoubtedly very faithful transcripts of nature he painted history as well as portrait and even the latter generally containing more than a single figure rise almost above that denomination  of the first sort is the decollation of st john at wilton it is in a good style but the coloring is raw the idea of st john is said to have been taken from the face of prince rupert at chatsworth is a very particular picture said to be general monk his child and his mistress whom he took against the consent of her husband the man in armor undoubtedly resembles monk but the whole piece has the air of a holy family nor is there any other tradition of any mistress of monk but the famous see an account of her in lord clarendons history of his life in ludlows memoires and in the collection of state poems vol i p    anne clarges whom he afterward married and who some say was a milliner there are many instances of painters who have deified their mistresses but the character of the virgin mary was never more prostituted than if assumed by anne clarges mr stanley has a picture extremely like this by  at albury in surrey the seat of the earl of arundel was a picture by dobson of the woman caught in adultery with several figures the heads taken from persons then living among whom was the poet cowley at chippenham in cambridgeshire formerly the seat of russel earl of orford in one piece are prince rupert colonel john russel and mr william murray drinking and dipping their favourribbands in the wine at blenheim is a family by some said to be that of francis carter an architect and scholar of inigo jones by others of lilly the astrologer whom virtue thought it resembled but whitlocke says that lilly had no family the man holds a pair of compasses i have seen nothing of dobson preferable to this there is the utmost truth in it at devonshirehouse house is another family piece of sir thomas brown author of religio medici his wife two sons and as many daughters mr willett merchant in thames street has a small familypiece of dr hibbard physician his wife and five children the father and mother are particularly well painted a little boy leans on the fathers knee evidently borrowed from the wellknown attitude by rubens of sir b gerbiers daughter two children on the right hand were certainly added afterward and are much inferior to the rest the dates were probably inserted at the same time a whole length of sir william compton is in the possession of the family at the lord byrons is the portrait of sir charles lucas and at drayton in northamptonshire henry mordaunt earl of peterborough in armor with a page holding his horse and an angel giving him his helmet the last circumstance may relate to his preservation in the civil war in which he was wounded and made his escape when taken prisoner with duke hamilton and lord holland this picture has great merit a head of the marquis of montrose was taken for the hand of vandyck in a corner in stone color is a statue of peace on the other side his helmet at mr skinners mr walkers collection is a large piece of prince charles in armor drawn about      mr windham a youth holding his helmet at bottom are arms and trophies i have mentioned a fine head of vanderdort at houghton dobsons wife by him is on the stairs of the ashmolean museum at oxford and his own head is at earl pauletts the hands were added long since by gibson as he himself told virtue charles duke of somerset had a picture of an old man sitting and his son behind him on this picture was written the following epigram published by john elsum among his epigrams on painting a work i have mentioned before though of no merit but by ascertaining some particular pictures page     it is a thin octavo printed in   00 with only his initial letters j e esquire this john elsum published another piece in   0  called the art of painting after the italian manner with practical observations on the principal colors and directions how to know a good picture with his name perceiving somebody behind his chair he turns about with a becoming air his head is raised and looking over his shoulder so round and strong you never saw a bolder here you see nature throughly understood a portrait not like paint but flesh and blood and not to praise dobson below his merit this flesh and blood is quickened by a spirit   at northumberlandhouse as i have said is a triple portrait of sir charles cotterel embraced by dobson and sir balthazar gerbier in a white wastecoat sir charles was a great friend and patron of dobson at rousham in oxfordshire the seat of the cotterels are several good portraits by him sir charles cotterel when at oxford with the king was engaged by his majesty to translate davilas history of the civil wars of france the frontispiece designed by sir charles himself was drawn by dobson it represented francis ii charles ix henry iii and iv with two dogs a popish and protestant cur fighting before them this sketch is still preserved in the family and in      was engraved in london for the history of thuanus he etched his own portrait at mr nicholass at horseley is a portrait of sir richard fanshaw which has been taken for the hand of dobson it was painted by one de meetre a name unknown to me   gerard honthorst tchambars sculp    in a collection of poems called calanthe is an elegy on our painter  gerard honthorst  the favorite painter of the queen of bohemia was born in      at utrecht and instructed in painting by bloemart but he completed his studies at rome where he stayed several years and painted many things for prince justiniani and other works excelling particularly in nightpieces and candlelights on his return he married well and having a fair character was remarkable for the number of his disciples of rank sandrart who was one says they were twentyeight at the same time who each paid him an hundred florins yearly but his greatest honor was instructing the queen of bohemia and her children at cashiobury lord essexs is a large picture of the queen of bohemia and her children by honthorst the elder sons are killing monsters that represent envy etc the king of bohemia like jupiter with the queen again like juuo are in the clouds the head of the queen not the latter is pretty well painted the rest very flat and poor among whom the princess de piles of the princess sophia there is a portrait in a straw hat by honthorst at wilton natural but not very good the other princess was louisa hollandina who practiced that art with success two pictures painted by her were in the collection of her uncle king charles see catal p    no  0    one of them is at kensington tobit and

maubuisson she died in   0  at the age of eightysix sophia and the abbess of maubuisson chiefly distinguished themselves king charles invited him to england where he drew various there were seven in king jamess collection pictures particularly one very large emblematic piece which now hangs on the queens staircase at hampton court charles and his queen as apollo and diana are sitting in the clouds the there is another at kensington of the duke and duchess to the knees sitting with their two children the dukes portrait is particularly good the duke had a large picture by honthorst representing a toothdrawer with many figures round him five feet by seven feet duke of buckingham under the figure of mercury introduces to them the arts and sciences while several genii drive away envy and malice it is not a pleasing picture but has the merit of resembling the dark and unnatural coloring of guercino this and other among the harleian mss no      art    is a letter from king charles to the duke of buckingham in the postscript to which he asks the duke if honthorst had finished the queens picture things he completed sandrart in six months and was rewarded with three thousand florins a service of silverplate for twelve persons and a horse and though he returned to utrecht he continued to paint for the king it must have been during his residence here that he drew an admirable half length of lucy countess of bedford now at woburn it is painted and finished with the greatest vivacity and clearness she is in black leaning on her hand mr west has the portraits of

bannerman sculp  nightpieces the latter worked for the king of denmark the close of his life was employed in the service of the prince of orange whose houses at the hague hounslaerdyck and reswick were adorned by his pencil with poetic histories at the last of the three he painted a chamber with the habits animals and productions of various countries and received  000 florins for his labor he died at the hague in    0 descamps in his second volume says that honthorst brought to england joachim sandrart his scholar and that the king bespoke many pictures of him and that for the earl of arundel he copied from holbein henry  th sir t more erasmus and several others and that he left england and went to venice in      i find no other authority for this account not one work of sandrart is mentioned in k charless collection and what is more conclusive against his having been in england he takes not the least notice of it himself in the life of honthorst though he relates his masters journey to england and his works here and calls himself one of his disciples  john van belcamp  was employed under vanderdort as a copyer of the kings one was of the queen in small in a piece of perspective sold at the dispersion of the collection pictures and was reckoned to succeed the whole length of edward iv in his nightgown and slippers the face in profile which hangs over the chimney

and excelled him in portraits her own is in the gallery at althorp king charles had several of her works her best was david with the head of goliath she drew some of the royal family and many of the

talents were so happy all as to suit the taste of charles the first laniere was born in italy was a musician painter engraver and understood hands he had great share in the the author of the english school says he put a particular mark on the pictures bought by him for the king but does not tell us what it was thus  he marked his own etchings with an l purchases made for the royal collection r symondes says the duke of buckingham once gave laniere  00 l in gold because he could not get of king james what laniere deserved another time gave him  00 l in gold and probably was even employed in the treaty of mantua one picture is said expressly in the kings catalogue to have been changed with mr laniere his fame was most considerable as a musician in ben johnsons works is a masque performed at the house of the lord hay in      for the entertainment of the french ambassador the whole masque after the italian manner stylo recitativo by master nicholas laniere who ordered and made both scenes and music he was employed many years afterward in a very different and more melancholy manner a vocal composition for a funeral hymn on his royal master written by thomas pierce was set by laniere woods athenae vol ii p     it was in this capacity that he had a salary of  00 l a year the patent is dated july         see rymers foedera he had besides the office of closetkeeper to the

kings pictures came from mantua quicksilver was got in amongst them and made them all black mr hieronymo laniere told me that to cleanse them first he tried fasting spittle then he mixed it with warm milk and those would not do at last he cleansed them with aquavitae alone and that took off all the spots and he says twill take off old varnish laniere seems to have been an adept in all the arts of picturecraft sanderson speaks of him as the first who passed off copies for originals by tempering his colors with soot and then by rolling them up he made them crackle and contract an air of

ambassador of that prince in      his pictures pleased at court and he was made chief painter to the prince of wales afterward charles ii in a ms catalogue of king charless pictures he is said to have painted a cieling with hercules and other gods in a room there called the contractors room but in which palace is not specified in the catalogue of james ii are mentioned three landscapes and the story of st sebastian by wouters and in sir peter lelys a landscape with figures on the misfortunes of the royal family he retired to antwerp where in      he was shot by the accidental discharge of a gun there is an epitaph on him in de bies gulden cabinet a large print after titian engraved by hollar in    0 is dedicated to wouters   weesop  arrived here in      a little before the death of vandyck of whose manner he was a lucky imitator and had the honor of having some of his pictures pass for that masters he left england in      saying he would never stay in a country where they cut off their kings head and were not ashamed of the action it had been more sensible to say he would not stay where they cut off the head of a king that rewarded painters and defaced and sold his collection one john weesop probably his son was buried in st martins in       john de critz  has been mentioned in the former volume though sergeant painter to charles i he may more properly be called a retainer to the arts than a professor his life is to be collected rather from officebooks than from his works or his reputation yet he was not ignorant i have two sketches of heads drawn by him with a pen that are masterly virtue saw many more in the hands of murray the painter who was scholar of a son or nephew of de critz who according to murray painted bravely scenes for masks among those drawings was a sketch from a picture of in the earl of oxfords library was a copy of hollands heroologia in which in an old hand supposed to be done immediately after the publication of the book in      was written where every picture was from which the prints were taken that of sir philip sidney is the same with lord chesterfields and under was written at mr de critzs  strong evidences of this being a genuine picture sir philip sidney then at the house of de critz and now in the possession of lord chesterfield at oatlands he painted a middle piece for a cieling which on the dispersion of the kings effects was sold for  0 l in      he painted the portrait of sergeant maynard with a paper in his hand in a book belonging to the board of works was a payment to john de critz for repairing pictures of palma and the caesars of titian this was in      among the annuities and fees payable out of the customs in the port of london in that reign was a payment to john de critz his majestys serjeantpainter for his annuity at  0 l a year due to him for one year ended at michaelmas      and in a wardrobe account lost in the fire in the temple was this entry to john de critz serjeantpainter for painting and gilding with good gold the body and carriages of two coaches and the carriage of one chariot and other necessaries     l   s   d anno      if this bill should seem to debase the dignity of sergeant painter it may comfort the profession to know that solimeni who was inferior to no painter of any age in vanity whatever he was in merit painted a coach for the present king of spain when king of naples which cost   000 l indeed i can produce no precedent of any great master who painted and gilded barges as sergeant de critz appears to have done by the following paper a memorandum in his own hand  john de critz demands allowance for these parcells of work following viz for repayreing refreshing washing and varnishing the whole body of his majestys privy barge in the courtbooks at paintershall there is a letter to the company from the earl of pembroke directing them to appoint certain persons of their hall to view the kings and queens barges lately beautified painted and gilded by de creetz serjeantpainter and give an estimate of the work which they did of   0 l and some other expenses and mending with fine gould and fair colors many and diverse parts thereof as about the chair of state the doors and most of the antiques about the windows that had been galled and defaced the two figures at the entrance being most new colored and painted the mercury and the lion that are fixed to the sternes of this and the row barge being in several places repaired both with gould and colors as also the taffarils on the top of the barge in many parts gilded and strowed with fair byse the two figures of justice and fortitude most an end being quite new painted and gilded the border on the outside of the bulk being new laid with fair white and trayled over with green according to the custom heretofore  and for baying and coloring the whole number of the oars for the row barge being thirtysix  on the other side of this scrap of paper is another bill for several times oyling and laying with fair white a stone for a sundyall opposite to some part of the king and queens lodgings the lines thereof being drawn in several colors the letters directing to the hours gilded with fine gould as also the glory and a scrowle gilded with fine gould whereon the number and figures specifying the planetary hours are inscribed likewise certain letters drawn in black informing in what part of the compass the sun at any time there shining shall be resident the whole work being circumferenced with a frett painted in a manner of a stone one the complete measure of the whole being six foot  at bottom of each of these bills are the sketches of heads i mentioned de critz and others were buyers of the kings goods to the value of      l rich symonds says that at de critzs house in austinfryars were three rooms full of the kings pictures emanuel de critz brother or son was one of the petitioners to the council of state for delivery of the goods they had purchased which had been detained by cromwell thomas de critz brother of john was a painter too and superior said murray to his brother one of the name was macebearer to the house of parliament a head of one oliver de critz with a paper in his hand is in the museum at oxford john de critz had a scholar called le mense who was born at antwerp  adrian hanneman  was born at the hague and painted both history and portraits having studied under one ravesteyn but more from the works of vandyck of whose airs of heads virtue thought him the best imitator he made adrlin hanneman abannerman sculp  love as is said before to the niece of cornelius johnson though without success and drew that painter his wife and son he came to england in the reign of king charles and for some time worked under mytens and continued here sixteen years returning to holland he became the favorite painter of mary princess of orange there is a picture of her and the prince in armor at lord straffords at wentworthcastle painted i believe by hanneman at windsor there were five other portraits of the royal family by him in the collection of james ii see the catalogue a portrait of duke hamilton at worksop the duke of norfolks a picture of kettles and utensils sir peter lely had a man playing on a lute two feet ten square in the library belonging to the cathedral of lincoln the portrait of one honeywood whose mother lived to see     of her own descendents there is a print of charles ii painted before his restoration by hanneman engraved by hen danckers at the hague and at general comptons virtue saw one done by hanneman at the same time english school he painted in the chamber of the states at the hague and for the here van wenwing two usurers counting their money while he worked on this he wanted a sum himself which he borrowed of the person who had ordered the picture and which when it was finished wenwing would have deducted but hanneman told him that all the gold he had borrowed was put into the picture and was what the misers were counting he died about    0 his son called william was buried in st martins in       there were several other painters here in the reign of charles who were so inconsiderable or of whom i find so little that i shall mention them very briefly  cornelius neve drew the portraits of richard lord buckhurst and mr edward sackville in one piece in      it is at knowle no    in the picturegallery at oxford is painted by him where he is called a celebrated painter in      he drew the portrait of mr ashmole in his heralds coat ashmoles diary p      k coker painted a head of colonel massey preserved at coddington in cheshire  matthew goodricke or gothericke is mentioned as a painter in one of the office books of that reign  in the inventory of the pictures at oatlands was a view of greenwich by stalband and in mr harenes sale      was an octagon landscape with the story of the centurion by the same hand something in the manner of paul brill but the colors exceedingly bright and glaring and in another catalogue of the kings pictures was a prospect of greenwich by portman  mr greenbury is mentioned in the page     catalogue of the kings collection for copying two pictures of albert durer by the direction of the lord marshal probably he was one of lord arundels painters  horatio paulin lived chiefly in holland he came to england went to hamburgh and thence to the holy land rotiere agreed to go with him but was discouraged descamps page     vol iii expresses surprise that pious painters should have exhibited to the public very licentious pieces and scandalous nudities but by the account which he has given of horatio paulin he seemed to present himself with a very easy solution of this paradox paulin set on foot a kind of promiscuous crusado to the holy land they were stored with crosses relics etc and on the road made many proselytes of both sexes a bakers wife in particular was so devout that she thought it a meritorious action to plunder her husband of his plate that she might equip herself for the pilgrimage when the caravan was furnished by theft one may easily conceive why it is apostle painted indecent altarpieces  povey lived in this reign and painted a head which was in the possession of mr leneve norroy  one hamilton an englishman is mentioned by page     sandrart as excelling in painting birds and grapes and doing several things for the elector of brandenburgh  edward bower drew the portrait of mr pym an equestrian figure of general fairfax and john lord finch of fordwich the two last were engraved by hollar  holderness drew the picture of an old woman with a skull which was in the collection of villiers duke of buckingham  t johnson made a draught of canterbury in      which hangs on the stairs of the library belonging to the cathedral  reurie is mentioned by in his graphice sanderson as a painter in little in       francis barlow  was of more note than the preceding artists see english school he was born in lincolnshire and placed with one sheperd a facepainter but his taste lay to birds fish and animals in which he made great figure though his coloring was not equal to his designs  consequently which is not often the case the prints from his works did him more honor than the works themselves especially as he had the good fortune to have some of them engraved by hollar and faithorn the title to one of his books in which some are etched by hollar is diversae avium species studiosissime ad vitam delineatae per fran barlow ingeniofissimum anglum pictorem guil faithorn excudit      there are six books of animals from the drawings of barlow and a set of cuts for aesops fables some cielings for birds he painted for noblemen and at clandon lord onslows are five pieces by barlow gentlemen in the country and he drew some of the monuments in westminsterabbey designed for an edition of mr keeps history of that cathedral mr symonds says he lived near the drum in drury lane and received eight pounds for a picture of fishes he once painted a half length of general monk and the hearse was designed by him as was expressed in the lord chamberlains warrant to sir christopher wren to prepare timber for it at monkes funeral i have a curious long roll engraved by white exhibiting the ceremonies and procession of that magnificent interment with a full description of it the frontispiece is well designed by barlow it is remarkable that forty gentlemen of good families submitted to wait as mutes with their backs against the wall of the chamber where the body laid in state for three   weeks waiting alternately twenty each day barlow though inheriting a large sum of money from a friend died poor so lately as   0   sir toby matthews  one of those heteroclite animals who finds his place any where his father was archbishop of york and he a jesuit he was supposed a wit and believed himself a politician his works are ridiculous and his greatest success was a little mischief in making converts on the lady newburgh being converted to popery lord conway writes thus to the earl of strafford the king did use such words of wat montagu and sir tobie matthew that the fright made wat keep his chamber longer than his sickness would have detained him and don tobiah was in such perplexity that i find he will make a very ill man to be a martyr but now the dog does again wag his tail strafford papers vol ii p     it seems in this business matthews was unjustly accused the conversion had been made by the duchess of buckingham and signor con the spanish resident p     the famous countess of carlisle as meddling as matthews and as affected was the object of his adoration he drew a character of her see this character prefixed to his letters which commends her so impertinently that with scarce straining it might pass for a satire for instance he says she has as much sense and gratitude for the actions of friendship as so extreme a beauty will give her leave to entertain and that although she began to be civil to people at first she would rather show what she could do than let her nature continue in it and that she never considered merit in others but in proportion as they had any to her that she affected particularity so much that you might fear to be less valued by her for obliging her that she had little religion was passionate could suffer no condition but plenty and glory was fickle and gay only out of contradiction because her physicians had told her she was inclined to melancholy  with a heap of such nonsense  in short i believe no proud beauty was ever so well flattered to her own contentment mr garrard master of the charter house a man of more sense and more plain sense than matthews has drawn this ladys character in fewer words and upon the whole not very unlike sir tobys picture my lady carlisle will be respected and observed by her superiors be feared by those that will make themselves her equals and will not suffer herself to be beloved but of those that are her servants strafford papers vol i p     sir toby matthewss title to a place in this work depends singly upon a letter from the duchess of buckingham to the duke r symondes says mr gage sir thoby matthewes mr flill were buyers of pictures for the duke of buckingham in which she tells him she had not yet seen the picture which toby matthews had drawn of the infanta and sent over virtue adds that he had some small skill in limning otherwise i should have concluded that he had only drawn the infantas portrait in the same fantastic colors which he had employed on lady carlisle however as it is not foreign to the design of this work to throw in as many lights as possible on the manners of the several ages i did not unwillingly adopt virtues mistake if it is one whoever desires to know more of this person will find his life in the athenae oxonienses but i have not yet done with these motley characters the kings taste made his court affect to be painters and virtuosi among these was  sir james palmer  often mentioned in the catalogue of the royal collection in which he sold gave and painted pictures of the latter was a page    for the others see p  0                   piece of tarquin and lucretia copied from titian another the feast of bacchus was delivered to him by the kings own hands to be copied in tapestry at the manufacture in mortlack he had lodgings in the tenniscourt at whitehall and is often mentioned as a domestic servant he was chancellor of the garter and married katherine eldest daughter of william lord powys widow of sir robert vaughan and was father of roger palmer earl of castlemain husband of the duchess of cleveland he was the person sent to richard atkyns for the picture in which the king distinguished two different painters and mr garrard in a letter to lord strafford dated jan        says i had almost forgot to tell your lordship that the diceingnight the king carried away in james palmers hat    0 pieces the queen was his half and brought him that good luck she shared presently  00 in stones accounts from which i have given some extracts above is mention of a monument for palmers wife if these men add no great ornament to our list it will at least be honored by our next the hogarth of poetry was a painter too i mean  samuel butler  the author of hudibras in his life prefixed to his works we are told that for his diversion he practiced music and painting i have seen adds the writer some pictures said to be of his drawing which remained several are actually extant in the possession of a person in worcestershire in that family of mr jefferys which i mention not for the excellency of them but to satisfy the reader of his early inclinations to that noble art for which also he was afterward entirely beloved by mr samuel cooper one of the most eminent painters of his time  francis cleyn  was a painter in a different style from any we had seen here for which reason though he arrived earlier than many i have mentioned i reserved him till i had dispatched the performers in oil he was born at rostock and retained in the service of christian iv king of denmark but the excellence of his genius prompted him to the search of better models than he found in that northern climate he traveled to italy and stayed there four years it was at rome i suppose he learned those beautiful grotesques in which he afterward shone at venice he became known to sir henry wotton and sir robert anstruther recommended him to prince charles he arrived while the prince was in spain but notwithstanding was graciously received by king james who mentions that circumstance in a latin letter that he wrote to the king of denmark desiring leave to detain cleyn in england though with a permission to return first to copenhagen and finish a work he had begun there and promising to pay the expense of his journey the letter is preserved by fuller in his worthies of surrey p    the request was granted and cleyn returned to london at the end of the summer the king had just then given two thousand pounds toward sir francis cranes new manufacture of tapestry at mortlack they had worked only after old patterns cleyn was placed there and gave designs both in history and grotesque which carried those works to singular perfection it appears by king charless catalogue that five of the cartoons were sent francesco cleyn tchambars sculp  thither to be copied by him in tapestry his pension is recorded by rymer vol xviii p     know ye that we do give and grant unto francis cleyne a certain annuitie of one hundred pounds by the year during his natural life he enjoyed this salary till the civil war and was in such favor with the king and in such reputation that on a small drawing of him in indian ink about six inches square which virtue saw he is called il famosissimo pittore francesco cleyn miracolo del secolo e molto stimato del re carlo della gran britania      cleyn was not employed solely in the works at mortlack he had a house near the church in covent garden and did several other things for the king and nobility at somerset house he painted a cieling of a room near the gallery with histories and compartments in gold the outside of wimbledonhouse he painted in fresco bolsover in nottinghamshire stonepark in northamptonshire and carewhouse at parsonsgreen since lord peterboroughs were ornamented by him there is still extant a beautiful chamber adorned by him at hollandhouse with a cieling in grotesque and small compartments on the chimnies in the style and not unworthy of parmegiano two chairs carved and gilt with large shells for backs belonging to the same room were undoubtedly from his designs and are evidences of his taste a letter strafford papers from lord cottington to lord strafford describing the formers house at hanworth mentions cleyn though not by name there is a certain large low room made under the building with a fountain in it and other rare devises and the open gallery is all painted by the hand of a second titian aug      in king charless catalogue is mention of four patterns for the great seal drawings i am informed that some drawings by cleyn are in the possession of the earl of moray in scotland on blue paper by cleyn he made designs for various artists particularly for several of hollars plates to virgil and aesop for these he received fifty shillings a piece there are two small books of foliages from his drawings one containing six small slips with animals in grotesque the other in five slips of the senses and the initial letters of his name f c inv      and two books for carvers goldsmiths etc containing    plates it is however uncertain whether these and a few other plates of the same kind are not by his son who had the same christian name and imitated his fathers manner such is a title page to lacrymae musarum elegies on the lord hastings who died in    0 the day before he was to have been married also seven plates of the liberal arts about four or five inches square prettily designed and neatly etched on a small print of the father etched by the son mr evelyn wrote a most pious man father of two sons who were incomparable painters in miniature all died in london by the register of mortlack it appears that he had three sons francis born in      who died and was buried at covent garden october       0 charles and john and two daughters sarah and magdalen he had another daughter probably born in london and called penelope virtue saw a miniature like coopers manner but not so well of dorothea youngest daughter of richard cromwell act        with these letters p c which he thought signified penelope cleyn at burleigh is a head of cecil lord roos      with the same letters in the catalogue of plates and prints exhibited to sale by peter stent      was a book of grotesques in ten plates francis cleyn inv et sculpsit cleyn besides his own sons instructed dobson and died himself about      mr english he etched a small print from titian christ and the two disciples at emaus a painter who died at mortlack in      had a picture of cleyn and his wife and several of his designs for tapestries all which came to mr crawley of hempsted hertfordshire richard symonds in one of his pocketbooks mentions another piece of cleyn and his family by candlelight and a copy by the son of a sacrifice from raphael which was in the royal collection and a drawing on colored paper at kensington i have lately found a picture which i do not doubt is of cleyns hand it represents christ and mary in a chamber the walls and windows of which are painted in grotesque different rooms are seen through the doors in one i suppose is martha employed in the business of the family there is merit in this piece particularly in the perspective and grotesques the latter of which and the figures in the manner of the venetian school make me not hesitate to ascribe it to this master  john hoskins  for the life of this valuable master i find fewer there is not even a portrait of him extant materials than of almost any man in the list who arrived to so much excellence virtue knew no more of him than what was contained in grahams english school where we are only told that he was bred a facepainter in oil but afterward taking to miniature far exceeded what he did before that he drew king charles his queen and most of the court and had two considerable disciples alexander and samuel cooper the latter of whom became much the more eminent limner hoskins though surpassed by his scholar the younger cooper was a very good painter there is great truth and nature in his heads but the carnations are too bricky and want a degradation and variety of tints i have a head of sergeant maynard by him boldly painted and in a manly style though not without these faults and another good one of lord falkland more descriptive of his patriot melancholy than the common prints it was in the collection of dr meade at burleigh is a portrait of david cecil son of john  th earl of exeter by frances daughter of the earl of rutland it is dated      and another of sir edward cecil afterward viscount wimbledon there is indeed one since the first edition of this book i have seen another at burleigh scarce inferior it is the profile of a boy in brown holding in one hand a plaything like castanets it is admirably natural work of hoskins that may be called perfect it is a head of a man rather young in the gown of a master of arts and a red satin wastecoat the clearness of the coloring is equal to either oliver the dishevelled hair touched with exquisite freedom it is in the possession of mr fanshaw but not known whose portrait virtue mentions a son of hoskins of the same name and says that this mark  distinguishes the works of the father from those of the son which have i h simply i meet with no other hint of a son of that name except in sanderson who barely names him page  0 in the same place he speaks in the like transient manner of a son of hilliard one peter hoskins is entered into the register of covent garden as buried july        hoskins the father was buried in that church feb         in the page    catalogue of king charles are mentioned two drawings by hoskins for the great seal colonel sothby has a head of sir benjamin rudyard by him and a profile which virtue thought might be hoskins himself prefixed to coryats crudities is a copy of verses with his name to them  alexander cooper  was nephew of hoskins and with his brother samuel of whom an account will be given in the ensuing volume was instructed in watercolors by their uncle alexander painted landscapes in this manner as well as portraits at burleigh is the story of acteon and diana by him he went abroad resided some time at amsterdam and at last entered into the service of queen christina  anne carlisle  a paintress admired for her copies it is not said whether in oil or miniature from italian masters graham english school says she was in such favor with king charles that he presented her and vandyck with as much ultramarine at one time as cost him above five hundred pounds if her share was near equal i should suppose she painted in oil it would be a very long time before the worth of  00 l in ultramarine could be employed in miniatures virtue mentions her teaching a lady to paint whose picture she drew standing behind her own herself was sitting with a book of drawings in her lap and he adds that many pieces painted by her were in the possession of a widow lady cotterel mrs carlisle died about    0  john petitot  was patronized by the two monarchs who of late years have given the noblest encouragement to artists charles  st and louis   th he deserved their protection as a genius and has never been equalled in enamel zincke alone has once or twice and but once or twice produced works that might stand in competition with any single performance of petitot  the latter was born at geneva in   0  his father a sculptor and architect having passed part of his life in italy had retired to that city the son was designed for a jeweller and having frequent occasion to make use of enamel he attained such a tone of color that bordier who afterward became his brotherinlaw conceived that if petitot would apply himself to portrait he might carry the art to great perfection though both wanted several colors which they knew not how to prepare for the fire their attempts had great success petitot executed the heads and hands bordier the hair draperies and grounds  in this intercourse of social labor the two friends set out for italy as painters the treasures of the art were open to them as enamellers they improved too by frequenting the best chemists of that country but it was in england that they were so fortunate as to learn the choicest secrets in the branch to which they had devoted themselves sir theodore mayern first physician to charles and a great chemist communicated to them the process of the principal colors which ought to be employed in enamel and which surpassed the famous vitrifications of venice and limoges  mayern introduced petitot to the king who knighted and gave him an apartment in whitehall the french author of the abrege de la vie des plus fameux peintres whom i copy and am sorry to criticize while i am indebted to him says that vandyck seeing some designs of petitot at the kings goldsmiths and informing himself of the author advised him to quit the profession of jeweller and apply himself to painting portraits in enamel but the biographer had told us that that step was already taken and surely had not been abandoned during a long stay in italy what the same writer adds that vandyck gave him instructions when petitot copied the works of that master and that his copies from vandyck are his best performances is much more agreeable to probability and fact the magnificent whole length of rachel de rouvigny countess of southampton in the collection of the duke of devonshire is painted from the original in oil by vandyck in the possession of lord hardwicke and is indubitably the most capital work in enamel in the world it is nine inches three quarters high by five inches and three quarters wide and though the enamel is not perfect in some trifling parts the execution is the boldest and the coloring the most rich and beautiful that can be imagined it is dated      his grace has a head of the duke of buckingham by the same hand with the painters name and the date    0 consequently a copy performed it is evidently copied from the dukes portrait in his familypiece by honthorst at kensington after the dukes death in the same collection is a portrait of a middleaged man in armor enclosed in a case of tortoishel the person unknown but inferior to none i have seen of this master the duchess of portland has another of the duke of buckingham exactly the same as the preceding charles first and his queen and the lady morton governess of the royal children who is celebrated by waller i have a fine head of charles  st in armor for which he probably sat as it is not like any i have seen by vandyck james  d when duke of york freely painted though highly finished and i suppose done in france a very large and capital one of his sister henrietta duchess of orleans exquisitely labored a very small but fine head of anne of austria another of madame de montespan and a few more of less note but all of them touched in that minute and delicate style into which he afterward fell in france and which though more labored has less merit in richness of tints than his english works vanderdort mentions a carving by petitot from titians lucretia in which way i find no other account of his attempts though as his father was a sculptor he probably had given his son some instructions  the tragic death of his royal protector was a dreadful stroke says his biographer to petitot who attended the exiled family to paris i question as so few english portraits appear by his hand and none that i know later than      whether the civil war did not early drive him back to france but bordier undoubtedly remained here sometime longer having been employed by the parliament to paint a memorial of the battle of naseby which they presented to fairfax their victorious general this singular curiosity is now in my possession purchased from the museum of thoresby who i have the receipt of the executors of fairfax to thoresby who paid     l for his purchases he has at the end of his ducatus leodiensis in the account of his own museum given a more minute description of these enamels bought it with other rarities from the executors of fairfax it consists of two round plates each but an inch and half diameter and originally served i suppose for the top and bottom of a watch such enamelled plates being frequent to old watches instead of crystals on the outside of that which i take for the bottom is a representation of the house of commons as exhibited on their seals by simon nothing can be more perfect than these diminutive figures of many even the countenances are distinguishable on the other piece within is delineated the battle of naseby on the outside is fairfax himself on his chestnut horse men engaging at a distance the figure and horse are copied from vandyck but with a freedom and richness of coloring perhaps surpassing that great master under the horse one reads p b fecit this is the single work which can with certainty be allotted to bordier alone and which demonstrates how unjustly his fame has been absorbed in the renown of his brotherinlaw charles  d during his abode in that kingdom took great notice of petitot and introduced him to louis who when the restoration happened retained petitot in his own service gave him a pension and lodged him in the louvre small portraits of that monarch by this great enameller are extremely common and of the two queens his mother and wife  in      he married margaret cuper the celebrated drelincourt performed the ceremony at charenton for petitot was a zealous protestant and dreading the consequences of the revocation of the edict of nantes in      he begged permission of the king to retire to geneva louis who did not care to part with so favorite a painter and who perhaps thought that an enamellers religion was not composed of sterner stuff than the great turennes eluded his demand and at last being pressed with repeated memorials sent petitot to fortleveque and bossuet to convert him the subtle apostle who had woven such a texure of devotion and ambition that the latter was scarce distinguishable from the former had the mortification of not succeeding and petitots chagrin bringing on a fever he at last obtained his liberty now almost arrived at the age of fourscore which makes it probable that his conversion rather than his pencil had been the foundation of detaining him he no sooner was free than he escaped with his wife to geneva in      his children who dreaded the kings wrath remained at paris and throwing themselves at his feet implored his protection his majesty says my author received them with great goodness and told them he willingly forgave an old man who had a whim of being buried with his fathers  i do not doubt but this is given and passed at the time for a bonmot  but a very flat witticism cannot depreciate the glory of a confessor who has suffered imprisonment resisted eloquence and sacrificed the emoluments of courtfavour to the uprightness of his conscience petitot did not wish to be buried with his fathers but to die in their religion  returned to his country the good old man continued his darling profession the king and queen of poland desired to be painted by his hand and sent their portraits to be copied by him in enamel but the messenger finding him departed proceeded to geneva where he executed them with all the vigor of his early pencil the queen was represented sitting on a trophy and holding the picture of the king for this piece he received an hundred louis dors  so great was the concourse to visit him that he was obliged to quit geneva and retire to very a little town in the canton of berne where as he was painting his wife an illness seized and carried him off in a day in      at the age of fourscore and four he had had seventeen children one of his daughters a widow was living in      my portrait of charles  st came from one of his sons who was a major in our service of the rest one only attached himself to his fathers art and practiced in london his father often sending him his works for models this son painted in miniature too and left descendents who are settled at dublin  it is idle to write a panegyric on the greatest man in any vocation that rank dispenses with encomiums as they are never wanted but where they may be contested petitot generally used plates of gold or silver seldom copper in the dawn of his reputation he received twenty guineas for a picture which price he afterward raised to forty his custom was to have a painter to draw the likeness in oil from which he made his sketches and then finished them from the life those of louis he copied from the best pictures of him but generally obtained one or two sittings for the completion his biographer says that he often added he specifies one at paris of michel lasne the engraver a large oval with hands of which one rests on his breast hands to his portraits i have seen but one such the whole length of lady southampton and that at loretto there is of his work an incomparable picture of the virgin a collector at paris possesses more than thirty of this great masters performances particularly the portraits of mesdames de la valiere montespan fontanges etc another has those of the famous countess dolonne the duchess of bouillon and other ladies of the court van gunst engraved after petitot the portrait of chevreau  of bordier we have no fuller account than this incidental mention of him yet i have shown that his is no trifling claim to a principal place among those artists whose works we have most reason to boast i wish this clue may lead to farther discoveries concerning him  i come now to other artists in the reign of charles and first of statuaries  andrew kearne  a german was brother of nicholas stone the elder for whom he worked kearne too carved many statues for sir justinian isham at his house near northampton at somersetstairs he carved the rivergod which answered to the nile made by stone and a lioness on the watergate of yorkstairs for the countess of mulgrave a venus and apollo of portland stone six feet high for each of which he had seven pounds he died in england and left a son that was alive since   00  john schurman  born at emden was another of stones workmen and afterward set up for himself he was employed by sir john baskerville made two shepherds sitting for sir john davers of chelsea a marble statue of sir t lucy for his tomb in warwickshire for which he was paid eighteen pounds and fifty shillings for polishing and glazing the same for a statue on this tomb of douglas lord belhaven is in the church of the abbey of holyroodhouse lord belhavens tomb a little boy on the same monument two sphinxes for sir john davers and hercules and antaeus for that gentlemans garden at the rate of sixteen pounds  edward pierce  father and son are mentioned here together though the father was a edward pierce senr and junr bannerman sculp  painter chiefly in the reign of the first charles the son a statuary who worked mostly under the second charles but each may be allotted to either period the father painted history landscape james ii had one of his hand see the catalogue and architecture but the greater part of his works consisting of altarpieces and cielings of churches were destroyed in the fire of london one of his cielings was in the church of covent garden for some time he worked under vandyck and several of his performances are at the duke of rutlands at belvoir a book of freezework in eight leaves etched in    0 was i suppose by the hand of the father as to him must be referred an entry in an officebook where he is mentioned for painting and gilding frames of pictures at somerset house at two shillings the foot feb         he also agrees to paint and gild the chimney piece in the crossgallery there for eight pounds dobson drew his picture he died a few years after the restoration and was buried at stamford he had three sons who all says graham english school became famous in their different ways one was john pierce a painter of the third i find no account of his profession the other was edward the statuary and architect he made the statues of sir thomas gresham of edward iii at the royal exchange and of sir william walworth at fishmongershall a marble bust of thomas evans master of and a great benefactor to the company of painters in      the bust is in their hall a model of the head of milton which virtue had the bust of sir christopher wren in the picturegallery at oxford and a bust of cromwell sold at an auction in      he much assisted sir christopher in many of his designs and built the church of st clement under his direction edward pierce too carved the four dragons on the monument at fifty pounds each the whole cost of that column exclusive of the dragons and of the basrelief which is not mentioned in the account appears by the survey of hook leybourn and others to have amounted to  000 l a rich vase at hampton court is another of the works of pierce he lived and died at his house the corner of surreystreet in the strand and was buried at st marys le savoy in school  hubert le soeur  one of the sew we have had that may be called a clasfic artist was a frenchman and disciple of john of boulogne he arrived at least as early as    0 and by the only i have been told that the monument of the duchess of lenox was le soeurs but i am not certain of it two of his works that remain we may judge of the value of those that are lost or destroyed of the latter were a vanderdorts catalogue p   0 i believe this very bust is now in the collection of mr hoare at stourhead i had not seen it when the first edition of this work was published bust of charles i in brass with a helmet surmounted by a dragon a la roman three feet high on a black pedestal the fountain at somerset house with several statues and six brazen statues at st jamess of those extant are the statue in brass of william earl of pembroke in the picturegallery at oxford given by the grandfather of the present earl and the noble equestrian figure of king charles at charing cross in which the commandinggrace of the figure and exquisite form of the horse are striking to the most unpracticed eye this piece was cast in      in a spot of ground near the church of covent garden and not being erected before the commencement of peacham la soeur bannerman sculp  the civil war it was sold by the parliament to john rivet a brazier living at the dial near holbournconduit with strict orders to break it in pieces but the man produced some fragments of old brass and concealed the statue and horse under ground till the restoration they had been made at the expense of the family of howardarundel who have still receipts to show by whom and for whom they were cast they were set up in their present situation at the expense of the crown about      by an order from the earl of danby afterward duke of leeds the pedestal was made by mr grinlin gibbons le soeur had a son isaac who was buried nov       0 at great st bartholomews the father lived in the close  enoch wyat  carved two figures on the water stairs of somerset house and a statue of jupiter and he altered and covered the kings statues which during the troubles were thrust into whitehallgarden and which it seems were too heathenishly naked to be exposed to the inflammeable eyes of that devout generation  zachary tailor  lived near smithfield was a surveyor and carver to the king as he is called in a book belonging to the board of works in      in      he is mentioned for carving the frames of the pictures in the crossgallery at somerset house at two shillings and twopence per foot he carved some things too at one bowden a captain of the trainedbands was another carver at wilton i believe at the same time with tailor wilton mr davis of the tenniscourt at whitehall had a good portrait of tailor with a compass and square in his hands  john osborn  was another carver of that time lord oxford had a large head in relievo on tortoiseshell of frederic henry prince of orange and these words joh osborn angl amstelod fecit       martin johnson  was a celebrated engraver of seals and lived at the same time with thomas and abraham simon the medallists he was a rival of the former who used puncheons for his graving which johnson never did calling simon a puncher not a graver johnson besides painted landscapes from nature selecting the most beautiful views of england which he executed it is said english school with much judgment freedom and warmth of coloring his works are scarce he died about the beginning of the reign of james ii   green  a sealcutter is only mentioned in a letter strafford papers june        to the lord treasurer from lord strafford who says he had paid him one hundred pounds for the seals of ireland but which were cut in england  christian van vianen he was of nuremberg see wrens parentalia p       as there was no art which charles did not countenance the chacers and embossers of plate were among the number of the protected at court the chief was vianen whose works are greatly commended by ashmole order of the garter p     several pieces of plate of his design were at windsor particularly two large gilt waterpots which cost     l two candlesticks weighing     ounces on the foot of one of them was chased christ preaching on the mount on the other the parable of the lost sheep and two covers for a bible and common prayer book weighing     ounces the whole amounting to    0 ounces and costing      l were in the year      when the last parcels were delivered presented as offerings by his majesty to the chapel of st george but in      captain foy broke open the treasury and carried away all these valuable curiosities as may be seen more at large in dugdale an agreement was made with the earlmarshal sir francis windebank and sir francis crane for plate to be wrought for the king at twelve shillings per ounce and before the month of june      he had finished nine pieces some of these i suppose were the abovementioned others were gilt for vianen complained that by the expense of the work and the treblegilding he was a great loser and desired to be considered the designs themselves were thought so admirable as to be preserved in the royal collection king charles had besides four plates chased with the story of mercury and argus vanderdorts catal p    mr west has two oval heads in alto relievo six inches high of charles and his queen with the initial letters of the workmans name c v land there were others of the name i do not know how related to him the ib p

by paul vianen abovementioned christian vianen had a very good disciple  francis fanelli  a florentine who chiefly practiced casting in metal and though inferior to le soeur was an artist that did credit to the kings taste vanderdort mentions in the royal collection a little figure of a cupid sitting on a horse running by fanelli and calls him the oneeyed italian the figures of charles i and his queen in niches in the quadrangle of st johns college oxford were cast by him and are well designed they were the gift of archbishop laud and were buried for security in the civil war william duke of newcastle was a patron of fanelli and bought many of his works still at welbeck particularly a head in brass of prince charles    0 with the founders name behind the pedestal fr fanellius florentinus sculptor magn brit regis and several figures in small brass as st george with the dragon dead another combating the dragon two horses grazing four others in different attitudes a cupid and a turk each on horseback and a centaur with a woman by the same hand or le soeurs are i conclude the three following curious busts in bronze a head of edward lord herbert of chirbury the author in the

one consists of fourteen plates in folio no date the other in twentyone leaves was published by van merle at paris      engraved as virtue thought by faithorne who was about that time in france fanelli had a scholar called john bank who was living in       theodore rogiers  is mentioned by vanderdort page       as the chaser of five square plates of silver with poetic stories in the kings collection and he made an ewer from a design of rubens mentioned in the life of that painter he must not be confounded with william rogers an englishman who engraved the title page to john linschotens collection of voyages to the east indies  i shall now set down what little i have to say of the medallists of king charles briot has been mentioned under the preceding reign he and t simon his disciple possessed the royal favor till the beginning of the troubles when simon falling off to the parliament i have already referred the reader to virtues account of the two simons and their works which he intended as a part of this history of the arts which is too long to transcribe here and which would be mangled by an abridgment abraham simon one of the brothers a man of a very singular character had fancied that the queen of sweden was in love with him and at last had an ambition of being a bishop a new medallist was employed on the few works executed for the king during the remainder of his life his name was  thomas rawlins  the first work by which he was known to the public was of a nature very foreign from his profession in    0 he wrote a play called the rebellion see langbaine p     subjoined to a book called goodfriday being meditations on that day printed in      is a collection of poems called calanthe by t r who by the presentationbook mr oldys sound was our thomas rawlins and afterward a comedy called tom essence v notes to drydens poems published in   volumes    0 p lxxxii vol i he was appointed engraver to the mint now become ambulatory by patent in      having in the preceding year while the king was at oxford struck a medal on the action of keintonfield under the date on the reverse is the letter r sideways evelyn p iii no    the next year he struck another after many offers of peace had been made by the king and been rejected on the reverse are a sword and a branch of laurel the legend in utrumque paratus the letter r under the bust of the king in      he made a large oval medal stamped in silver with the effigies of a man holding a coin in his hand and this inscription guliel parkhurst eq aurat custos camb et monet totius angliae      oxon       sculps i take for granted this mr parkhurst had been either a patron or relation of rawlins or one cannot conceive why he should have gone back twenty one years to commemorate an obscure person so little connected with the singular events of the period when it was struck this medal was in the collection of sir hans sloane and is now in the museum as was and is an oval piece of gold of charles ii the reverse a ship better workmanship than the preceding there is but one piece more certainly known for his a cast in lead thus inscribed rob bolles de scampton in com lincol baronet under the shoulder t rawlins f      there might be and probably were other works of his hand to which in prudence he did not set his name such is the bold medalion of archbishop laud struck in      he was employed by the crown till    0 when he died there is a print of his wife with this inscription dorothea narbona uxor d thomae rawlins supremi sculptoris sigilli carol i et carol ii d g magn brit franc et hiber regum in flecknos works published in      is a poem on that excellent cymelist or sculptor in gold and precious stones etc tho rawlins  john varin or warin  was an eminent medallist in france but appears by some works to have been in england at least to have been employed by english there are four such pieces in the collection of mr west the first a large medalion cast guil sil rob

by warin who died in      as i learn from a jetton of him by dacier  the last artist that i have to produce of this period but the greatest in his profession that has appeared in these kingdoms and so great that in that reign of arts we scarce know the name of another architect was  inigo jones  who if a table of fame like that in the tatler were to be formed for men of real and indisputable genius in every country would save england from the disgrace of not having her representative among the arts she adopted holbein and vandyck she borrowed rubens she produced inigo jones vitruvius drew up his grammar palladio showed him the practice rome displayed a theater worthy of his emulation and king charles was ready to encourage employ and reward his talents this is the history of inigo jones as a genius the particulars of his life have been often written and therefore i shall run them over very briefly adding some less known minutiae which i fear are the characteristics of these volumes and some catalogue of his works  he was born about      the son of a clothworker and by the most probable accounts bound apprentice to a joiner but even in that obscure situation the brightness of his capacity burst forth so strongly that he was taken notice of by one of the great lords at court some say it was the earl of arundel the greater among whom is loyd in his memoires p     number that it was william earl of pembroke though against that opinion there is at least a negative evidence which i shall mention presently by one of these lords inigo was sent to italy to study landscapepainting to which his inclination then pointed and for which that he had a talent appears inigo jones abannerman sculp  by a small piece preserved at chiswick the coloring is very indifferent but the trees freely and masterly imagined he was no sooner at rome than he found himself in his sphere he felt that nature had not formed him to decorate cabinets but design palaces he dropped the pencil and conceived whitehall in the state of venice he saw the works of palladio and learned how beautifully taste may be exerted on a less theater than the capital of an empire how his abilities distinguished themselves in a spot where they certainly had no opportunity to act though no building at venice is attributed to inigo the palace and a front of a church at leghorn are said to be designed by him we are not told though it would not be the least curious part of his history certain it is that on the strength of his reputation at venice christian iv invited him to denmark and appointed him his architect but on what buildings he was employed in that country we are yet to learn james i found him at copenhagen and queen anne took him in the quality of her architect to scotland he served prince henry in the same capacity and the place of surveyorgeneral of the works was granted to him in reversion on the death of that prince with whom at least all his lamented qualities did not die jones traveled once more to italy and assisted by ripeness of judgment perfected his taste to the interval between those voyages i should be inclined to assign those buildings of inigo which are less pure and border too much upon that bastard style which one calls king jamess gothic inigos designs of that period are not gothic but have a littleness of parts and a weight of ornaments with which the revival of the grecian taste was encumbered and which he shook of in his grander designs the surveyors place fell and he returned to england and as if architecture was not all he had learned at rome with an air of roman disinterestedness he gave up the profits of his office which he found extremely in debt and prevailed on the comptroller and paymaster to imitate his example till the whole arrears were cleared  in the reign of james i find a payment by a warrant from the council to inigo jones thomas baldwin william portington and george weal officers of his majestys works for certain scaffolds and other works by them made by the command of the lord chamberlain against the arraignment of the earl of somerset and the countess his lady the expense was twenty pounds  in the foedera vol xviii p    see also in the strafford papers some letters of mr garrard which contain an account of proceedings under that commission by virtue of which twenty newly erected houses in st martinslane were pulled down is a commission to the earl of arundel inigo jones and several others to prevent building on new foundations within two miles of london and palace of westminster  in    0 he was employed in a manner very unworthy of his genius king james set him upon discovering that is guessing who were the founders of stonehenge his ideas were all romanized consequently his partiality to his favorite people which ought rather to have prevented him from charging them with that mass of barbarous clumsiness made him conclude it a roman temple it is remarkable that whoever has treated of that monument has bestowed it on whatever class of antiquity he was peculiarly fond of and there is not a heap of stones in these northern countries from which nothing can be proved but has been made to depose in favor of some of these fantastic hypotheses where there was so much room for vision the phoenicians could not avoid coming in for their share of the foundation and for mr tolands part he discovered a little stonehenge in ireland built by the druidess gealcopa who does not know the druidess gealcopa who lived at inisoen in the county of donnegal see a summary of this controversy in the life of inigo jones in the biographia britannica   in the same year jones was appointed one of the commissioners for the repair of st pauls but which was not commenced till the year      when laud then bishop of london laid the first stone and inigo the fourth in the restoration of that cathedral he made two capital faults he first renewed the sides with very bad gothic and then added a roman portico magnificent and beautiful indeed but which had no affinity with the ancient parts that remained and made his own gothic appear ten times heavier he committed the same error at winchester thrusting a screen in the roman or grecian taste into the middle of that cathedral jones indeed was by no means successful when he attempted gothic the chapel of lincolns end has none of the characteristics of that architecture the cloister beneath seems oppressed by the weight of the building above in dugdales origines judiciales p    is an account of the building of that chapel from a design of inigo the first proposal of building it was in   0  but it was retarded till about      the charge was estimated at two thousand pounds it was finished in five years and consecrated on ascensionday      by the bishop of london dr done preaching the sermon   the authors of the life of jones place the erection of the banqueting house in the reign of king charles but as i have shown from the accounts of nicholas stone it was begun in      and finished in two years  a small part of the pile designed for the palace of our kings but so complete in itself that it stands a model of the most pure and beautiful taste several plates of the intended palace of whitehall have been given but i believe from no finished design the four great sheets are evidently made up from general hints nor could such a source of invention and taste as the mind of inigo ever produce so much sameness the strange kind of cherubims on the towers at the end are proposterous ornaments and whether of inigo or not bear no relation to the rest the great towers in the front are too near and evidently borrowed from what he had seen in gothic not in roman buildings the circular court is a picturesque thought but without meaning or utility the whole fabric however was so glorious an idea that one forgets for a moment in the regret for it is not being executed the confirmation of our liberties obtained by a melancholy scene that passed before the windows of that very banqueting house  in      he was employed at somerset house where a chapel was to be fitted up for the infanta the intended bride of the prince sir h bourgchier in a letter to archbishop usher dated july         says the new chapel for the insanta goes on in building there was another chapel erected for her at st jamess of which don carlos colonna laid the first stone v rushworth the chapel is still in being the front to the river part only of what was designed and the watergate were erected afterward on the designs of inigo as was the gate at yorkstairs  upon the accession of charles he was continued in his posts under both king and queen his fee as surveyor was eight shillings and fourpence per day with an allowance of fortysix pounds a year for houserent besides a clerk and incidental expenses what greater rewards he had are not upon record considering the havoc made in offices and repositories during the war one is glad of being able to recover the smallest notices  during the prosperous state of the kings affairs the pleasures of the court were carried on with much taste and magnificence poetry painting music and architecture were all called in to make them rational amusements and i have no doubt but the celebrated festivals of louis xiv were copied from the shows exhibited at whitehall in it is time the most polite court in europe ben johnson was the laureat inigo jones the inventor of the decorations laniere and ferabosco composed the simphonies the king the queen and the young nobility danced in the interludes we have accounts of many of these entertainments called masks they had been introduced by anne of denmark i shall mention those in which jones was concerned  hymenaei

serves to show the arrogance of the man who presumed to satirize jones and rival shakespeare with the latter indeed he had not the smallest pretensions to be compared except in having sometimes writ absolute nonsense johnson translated the ancients shakespeare transfused their very soul into his writings  another person who seems to have born much resentment to jones was philip earl of pembroke r symondes calls him the bawling coward in the harleian library was an edition of stonehenge which formerly belonged to that earl and the margins of which were full of strange notes writ by him not on the work but on the author or any thing else i have such another commonplace book if one may call it so of earl philip the life of sir thomas more in the stonehenge are memorandums jokes witticisms and abuse on several persons particularly on cromwell and his daughters and on inigo whom his lordship calls iniquity jones and says he had   000 l a year for keeping the kings houses in repair this might be exaggerated but a little supplies the want i have mentioned of any record of the rewards bestowed on so great a man it is observable that the earl who does not spare reflections on his architect never objects to him his having been maintained in italy by earl william nor does webb in his preface to the stonehenge though he speaks of inigos being in italy say a word of any patron that sent him thither earl philips resentment to jones was probably occasioned by some disagreement while the latter was employed at wilton there he built that noble front and a grotto at the end of the water wilton is one of the principal objects in a history of the arts and belles lettres sir philip sidney wrote his arcadia there for his sister vandyck drew many of the race holbein and inigo jones imagined the buildings earl thomas completed the collection of pictures and assembled that throng of statues and the last earl henry has shown by a bridge designed by himself that had jones never lived wilton might yet have been a villa worthy of ancient rome  the works of inigo are not scarce though some that bear his name were productions of his scholars some indeed neither of the one nor the other albins in essex i should attribute to the last class though always ascribed to inigo if he had any hand in it it must have been during his first profession and before he had seen any good buildings the house is handsome has large rooms and rich cielings but all entirely of the king jamess gothic pishiobury in hertfordshire is said to have been built by him for sir walter mildmay at woburn is a grottochamber and some other small parts by him as there is of his hand at thorneyabbey and a summer house at lord barringtons in berkshire the middle part of each end of the quadrangle at st johns oxford is ascribed to him the supporters of the royal arms are strangly crowded in over the niches but i have seen instances of his overdoing ornament charltonhouse in kent is another of his supposed works but some critics have thought that only the great gate at the entrance and the colonades may be of his hand the cabinet at whitehall for the kings pictures was built by him but we have no drawing of it at st jamess he designed the queens chapel surgeonshall is one of his best works and of the most admired the arcade of covent garden and the church two structures of which i want taste to see the beauties in the arcade there is nothing remarkable the pilasters are as errant and homely stripes as any plaisterer would make the barnroof over the portico of the church strikes my eyes with as little idea of dignity or beauty in justice to inigo one must own that the defect is not in the architect but in the order  who ever saw a beautiful tuscan building would the romans have chosen that order for a temple mr onslow the late speaker told me an anecdote that corroborates my opinion of this building when the earl of bedsord sent for inigo he told him he wanted a chapel for the parishioners of covent garden but added he would not go to any considerable expense in short said he i would not have it much better than a barn  well then replied jones you shall have the handsomest barn in england as it could do if it covered nothing but a barn the expense of building that church was   00 l ambresbury in wiltshire was designed by him but executed by his scholar webb who married a cousingerman of jones chevening is another house ascribed to him but doubtful gunnersbury near brentford was certainly his the portico is too large and engrosses the whole front except a single window at each end the staircase and salon are noble but destroy the rest of the house the other chambers are small and crowded by vast chimneypieces placed with an italian negligence in any corner of the room lindseyhouse jones was one of the first that observed the same gradual diminution of pilasters as in pillars lindseyhouse owes it is chief grace to this singularity in lincolnsinnfields has a chaster front but is not better disposed for the apartments in      a special commission was issued to the lord chancellor the earls of worcester pembroke arundel and others to plant and reduce to uniformity lincolns innfields that square is laid out with a regard to so trifling a circumstance as to be of the exact dimensions of one of the pyramids this would have been admired in those ages when the keep at kenelworthcastle was erected in the form of a horsefetter and the escurial in the shape of st laurences gridiron as it shall be drawn by way of map or groundplot by inigo jones surveyor general of the works coleshill in berkshire the seat of sir matthew pleydell built in    0 and cobhamhall in kent were his he was employed to rebuild castleashby and finished one front but the civil war interrupted his progress there and at stokepark in northamptonshire shaftsburyhouse now the londonlyingin hospital on the east side of aldersgate street is a beautiful front at wing seven miles from his present seat at ethorp in buckinghamshire sir william stanhope pulled down a house built by inigo the front to the garden of hinton st george in somersetshire the seat of earl poulet and the front of brympton formerly the mansion of sir philip sydenham were from designs of jones as chilhamcastle and the tower of the church at stains where inigo sometime lived are said to be so is a very curious work if really by him as i know no other performance of his in that kind a bridge at gwydder in wales on the estate of the duke of ancaster some alterations and additions he made at sion at oatlands remains a gate of the old palace but removed to a little distance and repaired with the addition of an inscription by the present earl of lincoln the grange the seat of the lord chancellor henley in hampshire is entirely of this master it is not a large house but by far one of the best proofs of his taste the hall which opens to a small vestibule with a cupola and the staircase adjoining are beautiful models of the purest and most classic antiquity the gate of beaufortgarden at chelsea designed by jones was purchased by lord burlington and transported to chiswick where in a temple are some wooden seats with lions and other animals for arms not of his most delicate imagination brought from tarthall he drew a plan for a palace at newmarket but not that wretched hovel that stands there at present the last and one of the most beautiful of his works that i shall mention is the queens house at greenwich the first idea of the hospital is said to have been taken by webb from his papers the rest of his designs and his smaller works as chimnies and cielings etc may be seen in the editions of kent ware vardy and campbell  dr clarke of oxford had joness palladio with his own notes and observations in italian which the doctor bequeathed to worcester college the duke of devonshire has another with the notes in latin lord burlington had a vitruvius noted by him in the same manner the same lord had his head by dobson at houghton it is by vandyck hollar engraved one of them villamena made a print of him while he was in italy among the strassord papers there is a letter from lord cottington to the lord deputy sending him a memorial from inigo relating to the procurement of marble from ireland  inigo tasted early of the misfortunes of his master he was not only a favorite in vanderdorts catalogue is mention of a picture of stenwyck bought by inigo for the king p    and of a waxen picture of henry viii and a drawing of prince henry presented by him p    but a roman catholic in      he paid     l for his delinquency and sequestration whether it was before or after this fine i know not that he and stone buried their joint stock of ready money in scotlandyard but an order being published to encourage the informers of such concealments and four persons being privy to the spot where the money was hid it was taken up and reburied in lambethmarsh  grief misfortunes and age terminated his life he died at somerset house july         and on the   th of the same month was buried in the church of st bennets paulswharf where a monument the  on the frame of his picture when bought by sir robert walpole  ermine and ermine a lion rampant or within a border  of the same erected to his memory was destroyed in the fire of london  i here conclude this long chapter on the reign of king charles the admirers of that prince will not think i hope that i have stinted them in anecdotes of their favorite monarch  the next scarce deserves the name of a chapter it contains the few names we find of  major general lambert abannerman sculp    anecdotes of painting etc chap iii artists during the interregnum of these the first in rank if not in merit was  general lambert  who we are told by the author of the english school was a great encourager of painting and a good performer in flowers some of his works were at the duke of leedss at wimbleton and it was supposed that he received instructions from baptist gaspars whom he retained in his service the generals son john lambert painted portraits there is a medal of the general by simon  robert walker  a portraitpainter cotemporary with vandyck but most remarkable for being the principal painter employed by there is a capital half length of general moncke at the countess of montraths twickenham park i do not know the painter but probably it was walker cromwell whose picture he drew more than once one of those portraits represented him with a gold chain about his neck to which was appendent a gold medal with three crowns the arms of sweden and a pearl sent to him by christina in return for his picture by cooper on which milton wrote a latin epigram this head by walker is in the possession of lord mountford at horseth in cambridgeshire and was given to the late lord by mr commissary greaves who found it in an inn in that county another is at the earl of essexs at cashiobury another piece contained cromwell and lambert together this was in lord bradfords collection a third was purchased for the great duke whose agent having orders to procure one and meeting with this in the hands of a female relation of the protector offered to purchase it but being refused and continuing his solicitation to put him off she asked  00 l  and was paid it it was on one of these portraits that elsum wrote his epigram which is no better than the rest by lines oth face and language of the eye we find him thoughtfull resolute and fly   from one of r symondess pocket books in which he has set down many directions in painting that had been communicated to him by various artists he mentions some from walker and says the latter received ten pounds for the portrait of mr thomas knights wife to the knees that she sat thrice to him four or five hours at a time that for two half lengths of philosophers which he drew from poor old men he had ten pounds each in      that he paid twenty five pounds for the venus putting on her smock by titian which was the kings and valued it at sixtypounds as he was told by mrs boardman robert walker tchambars sculp  who copied it a paintress of whom i find no other he names too loveday and wray equally unknown mention and that walker copied titians famous venus which was purchased by the spanish ambassador and for which the king had been offered   00 l he adds walker cries up de critz for the best painter in london  walker had for some time an apartment in arundelhouse and died a little

victuallers tapsters chaundlers bakers and other inferior tradesmen were then wont to obtrude and putt upon their chapmen and customers in the buying and selling of small commodities and finding in his royal wisdom that besides the inconvenience and loss that these tokens brought with them to the poorer sort of people the use of them was not without some wrong to his royal prerogative which ought not only to authorize all sorts of coin but whatsoever else in the nature of coin should serve as the measure of buying and selling out of these considerations which were for the preservation of his majestys own honor and the good and benefitt of his loveing subjects itt pleased his majesty thereupon to appoint and ordeyne by lettres patents under his great seal of england that a convenient quantity of one uniforme sort of farthinge tokens should be exactly and artificially made in copper with his majestys name and title thereupon to be stamped to be publicly used and to pass between man
