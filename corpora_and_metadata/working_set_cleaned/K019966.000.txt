a letter to the people of scotland  price halfacrown  entered in the hallbook of the company of stationers  a letter to the people of scotland on the alarming attempt to infringe the articles of the union and introduce a most pernicious innovation by diminishing the number of the lords of session  by james boswell esquire  remember o my friends the laws the rights the generous plan of power delivered down from age to age by your renowned forefathers o let it never perish in your hands but piously transmit it to your children addison london printed for charles dilly in the poultry mdcclxxxv  a letter to the people of scotland when i presumed to write to my countrymen last year to rouse their spirit against mr foxs east india bill i had the happiness to find my letter received not only with indulgence but with a generous warmth of heart which i can never forget but to the latest moment of my life shall most gratefully remember the fire of loyalty was kindled it flew through our counties and our boroughs the king was addressed the constitution was saved i was proud to have been able thus ciere viros prouder still than of receiving the applause of the minister of the crown which he was pleased to convey to me in a very handsome letter upon which however i set a high value considering not only the minister but the man and accordingly it shall be preserved in the archives of my family  i now feel myself called upon to to write to them again upon a subject of less magnitude indeed but of most interesting concern the crown is not in danger every day god forbid it should  as if misfortune made the throne her seat and none could be unhappy but the great but what is the crown without subjects and what are subjects without a good administration of justice a rage for innovation has gone forth and that rage seconded by avarice and inordinate love of power in different parties according to their different interests has lately threatened and still threatens us with a violent shock to our civil judicature by reducing the number of the lords of session from fifteen to ten that ten may have larger salaries this comes home to our business and bosoms it is a very serious alarm indeed as to the barons of exchequer i shall say nothing it is but a modern court and we are told a person of high office in the law said they were not so much judges as revenue officers but the court of session has a vast jurisdiction it was formed by james v of scotland anno      after the model of the parliament of paris it consisted originally of seven churchmen seven laymen and a prelate as president this was altered they are now all laymen and none can be appointed but who have been five years advocates or principal clerks of court or ten years clerks to his majestys signet but advocates are almost always appointed their gowns are of purple cloth and crimson velvet very gracefully disposed and they still retain the sacerdotal badge of a cawl or pouch which hangs on their shoulders as a part of the gown like that of the capuchins its jurisdiction is not only supreme in scotland over all causes civil and consistorial that is to say causes of the nature of the ecclesiastical causes in england with this amazing difference that they have a power to give a sentence of divorce equivalent to an act of parliament but has also a considerable extent in criminal cases and let me add that it has acquired a kind of undefined arbitrary jurisdiction called its nobile officium for a full and bold account of which i refer you to dr gilbert stuart  i cannot but complain of the secret and sudden mode of framing and bringing forward this momentous bill  what shall the supreme civil court of a country be diminished one third  shall an establishment sanctified by the acquiescence of ages be pulled to pieces without any communication whatever with the subjects of that country high or low nay without ever consulting the bar the faculty of advocates that learned body who are guardians of the law  antistites justitiae but scandal says mr henry dundas has been applied to by some of the judges who after feasting at baylls french tavern and raising their spirits high with wine have formed the lofty wish of reverently paying their court to regina pecunia  and mr henry dundas sometimes called harry the ninth very willing to oblige those senators and make them his devoted humble servants has nodded assent egregiam sane loudem et spolia ampla refertis but mr dundas not being sure that the people of scotland are yet entirely tame has been too wise to commit himself in this desperate business but has only given instructions and then mr ilay campbell the present lord advocate of scotland whom his brethren did the honor to elect their vice dean rises in the house of commons with this same pretty little bill cut and dry and thinks he may at once kill his five men and in triumph call out off with their heads  so much for lords of session but let him beware he will find them rise with gashes on their crowns to push him and others too perhaps from their stools like the vision in mr glovers celebrated ballad of hosiers ghost a sad troop will appear all shrouded in dreary robes as winding sheets and frowning on a hostile band  but indeed indeed our country is at a miserable ebb when its great and good families are totally indifferent about every public concern and have so little spirit even as to their private concerns that they never advance like men to the fountain head of government but indolently or timidly suffer all to be done by some person or other who for the time is brought forward or who puts himself forward as a minister for scotland they are afraid to let their natural voice be heard by administration but must convey their wishes through a speaking trumpet which i will tell them may be pointed high or low as he who holds it may think proper but if the stuarts the hamiltons the erskines the craufurds the montgomeries the douglases the grahams the somervilles the cathcarts the kennedies in short all the men of blood and of property who ought to be men of consequence hang back are we to be surprised that administration appoints a locum tenens an agent or by whatever name he may be called or that some able and ardent politician takes their place i remember archibald duke of argyll  i remember stuart mackenzie  i remember gilmour all in their turn bowed to and bringing the people of scotland to st jamess and the treasury as a salesman drives black cattle to smithfield poor dumb beasts why should they not walk up themselves and bellow as they may incline  i will bellow out for rome and for my country and mouth at caesar till i shake the senate then came mr henry dundas who has made a distinguished figure at more markets than one  whether at oxford market with lord north or leadenhall market with mr pit  there was a time when we were flattered there was to be no monopoly  when that titus that deliciae humani generis the duke of portland i give his grace as mr burke gave him me not having the good fortune to be known to him when he presided  o then all was to go well with scotland  there was to be no gobetween  nobody to keep back the individuals of that distant part of the island from fairly asserting their pretensions whether from birth wealth or merit but alas we soon found there was only a change of dundases instead of mr henry dundas we got sir thomas dundas and now we have mr henry dundas again  mr dundas is of a great law race the family of arniston has for four successive generations been judges in our supreme civil court and for these two last been at the head of it as president  a very extraordinary instance in modern times where it can be said per fasces numerat avos why then o why mr dundas should you attempt to injure this ancient institution are you not afraid that the shades of your ancestors may disturb your pillow be not too bold i entreat you there are some things which we will bear and some things which we will not bear think o think of vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself besides sir you are the dean of the faculty of advocates we have placed you in the chair where lockhart sat we expect you will not betray us  but that i may now speak to my countrymen in plain and i flatter myself convincing argument let us consider the peculiar form and constitution of the court of session it will hardly be believed in england that we have no juries in civil causes still more strange will it seem that we once had that inestimable privilege and lost it  nobody can tell how but lord kames has proved it  that a country should in the progress of civilization in every other respect become more barbarous in its executive jurisprudence is a wonderful and a disgraceful phenomenon nay we have no grand jury in scotland there is no such thing as finding a bill by the country all criminal prosecutions are by information of the first crown lawyer or by immediate indictment at the suit of private persons with his concurrence so that there is neither the security against unjust prosecutions which the verdict of our peers would afford nor is there a certainty that crimes which ought to be prosecuted will be prosecuted all is left to the will and pleasure of his majestys advocate the attorney general of scotland that anomalous personage whose status puzzles the house of commons who is a lord but yet not noble and tomorrow may descend to be only the honorable or ascend to be the right honorable gentleman  placed on this isthmus of a middle state a being darkly wise and rudely great the lord advocate of scotland has the whole power of a grand jury in his person the fat mr edward bright of malden whose print is in all our inns to amuse the weary traveller is nothing to the learned lord  he could button seven men in his waistcoat but the learned lord comprehends hundreds the grand juries of thirty counties are packed within his little circumference  the court of session then is not only a body of judges but like the parliament of paris it is a standing jury for all scotland and will it be seriously maintained that fifteen is too large a number when that is considered my amiable and honorable friend dempster that rara avis of the scottish breed who has sat in parliament almost as long as our present most gracious sovereign has sat upon the throne and has shown himself uniformly independent uniformly benevolent when i talked to him upon this subject exclaimed fifteen too few i would rather have fifty they talk of there being only twelve judges in england i say there are twenty thousand  the juries  by whom almost every thing is decided and our fifteen lords of session are all we have for a jury in civil causes  nobly said there are twenty thousand judges in england  judges of law as well as of fact  and i hope in god there ever shall be notwithstanding all that the old conjuror or any of his pupils can do while a loft and a towers can write and a lee and an erskine plead that sacred palladium will be preserved  if the british parliament will give us a grand jury and juries in civil causes for both of which if i am ever thought worthy of being sent into the house of commons as an independent gentleman i shall certainly move for leave to bring in a bill i will answer for it that the people of scotland when deliberately consulted  as they ought to be in justice in propriety and in common decency will cheerfully agree to have the number of the lords of session diminished because they would then have something better than their ancient aristocratical court and with exultation i can tell that so far as the people of scotland can  in the limited privilege of juries which they have  they do now exercise their constitutional right in its full extent we have a smellie who has with a calm but an undaunted spirit pointed it out to his fellow citizens in a well written discourse and a few months ago william spence a young matross for whom i was counsel was indicted by the lord advocate for felonious fireraising he was prosecuted by his lordship in person with all his address and the lord justice clerk the vice president of the high court of justiciary gave a charge with all his his ability to find him guilty but a respectable jury acquitted him and as i hope for mercy from the judge of all the earth had i been one of their number i should have been clear to join in the verdict i will give up my own opinion to no human authority  in the present form and constitution of the court of session there is occasion for at least the full number of judges which were at first appointed and which has remained undiminished now for two hundred and fifty three years it is remarkable that when james v instituted the court the number of the judges was thought small take the words of buchanan hist lib    cap    joannes dux albinus a pontifice romano impetravit ut summa pecuniae annua quanta satis esset ad paucorum judicum salarium solvendum imperaretur ecclesiastico ordini universo a singulisque pro modo census exigeretur he tells us it was difficult to obtain money for salaries even to those few so much stronger then too was the love of money than the love of justice  and he sternly delivers his opinion that the institution did not produce the good that was expected from it omnium civium bona quindecim hominum arbitrio sunt commissa quibus et perpetua est potestas et imperium plane tyrannicum  the perpetua potestas is the grievance of a standing jury and the imperium plane tyrannicum must in the nature of things reside in a body of men who possess at once the province of judge and of jury nay of common law judges and equity judges who are both kings bench and chancery and whose decisions therefore may be a compound of law and of fact and of equity as its members may be differently moved  it is this which makes it of infinite consequence to us to preserve all the judges we have as long as the court retains the same constitution for it has been found in practice that notwithstanding the staggering objections to it in theory this same court of fifteen has been so balanced and mixed and tempered and mellowed by the workings of various qualities in the course of time that upon the whole it has done very well  there may to be sure come a douglas cause which is too vast an object for the throw of such a complicated die non nostrum est tantas componere lites that is not much because for great causes we have an appeal to that august tribunal the house of lords but as the expense of an appeal is more than the value of almost every cause that the court of session decides the right of appeal is nothing to the greatest number of our suitors  we are therefore concerned that innovation should be prevented as we may fear but cannot foresee its effects and as the imperium of the court would be still more tyrannicum in ten than in fifteen as spirits have more force as they are more compressed by distillation  our ancestors took care to have it solemnly stipulated in the    th article of the union that the court of session or college of justice do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union subject nevertheless to such regulations for the better administration of justice as shall be made by the parliament of great britain  is it possible think you by any artifice of words by any little quirk of any sort to explain away this article and to maintain that the excepted power to make regulations for the better administration of justice in a court which is to remain in all time coming as now constituted shall be understood to give a license to destroy that very court itself by changing its constitution is a court of ten the same with a court of fifteen is a twolegged animal the same with a fourlegged animal i know nobody who will gravely defend that proposition except one grotesque philosopher whom ludicrous fable represents as going about avowing his hunger and wagging his tail fain to become cannibal and eat his deceased brethren it is clear that the substance must be preserved though the accidents may be varied the court of session the quindecem homines must remain unless by consent of the people of scotland themselves though the proceedings of the court the modes of administrating justice by those fifteen may be regulated occasionally as the british parliament in its great wisdom shall see fit if any man can entertain a doubt of this if he is capable of having his understanding so perverted i cannot argue with him  is it a light matter then to infringe the articles of the union  my countrymen hear me i accost you with a warning voice  have a care  i myself do fairly acknowledge that i venerate and love the ancient hierarchy though like whitefield of whose pious and animated society i had some share i can communicate with all sincere christians but you in general think differently and your kirk your presbyterian establishment stands just upon the same ground of security that the court of session does no doubt it may be abolished by universal consent or by consent of a majority of the people of scotland for that is my firm opinion of the import of the articles of the union but the british parliament cannot abolish it for the british parliament sits under those very articles and is limited by them but once yield the principle were it in the smallest iota and there is an end of your security  i shall take leave to press upon you the apprehension of what i believe we shall all agree in resisting i mean that if the articles of union should be infringed there might then most probably be a prodigious innovation in our land tax and this concerns not scotland alone  my lords and gentlemen of the english counties where the land tax is low on you i call if innovation is thus to stride at large the equalizing system may be extended and let me tell you it is not you that can prevent it you are too few it is to scotland you owe your safety government at present dare not equalize the land tax scotland would rise to a man and assert the articles of the union but the praefervidum ingenium scotorum may be subdued  there is a melancholy gradation in the old song of waly waly up the bank  i leaned my back unto an oak i thought it had been a trusty tree but first it bowed and then it brake and so did my true love to me let not the scottish spirit be bowed let lowther come forth and support us we are his neighbors paries proximus ardet we all know what he can do he upon whom the thousands of whitehaven depend for three of the elements he whose soul is all great  whose resentment is terrible but whose liberality is boundless i know that he is dignified by having hosts of enemies but i have fixed his character in my mind upon no slight inquiry i have traversed cumberland and westmoreland i have sojourned at carlisle and at kendal i know of the lonsdale club at lancaster  lowther be kindly entreated  come over to macedonia and help us  innovation is in my mind a very perilous experiment i respect the ancient barons for their nolumus leges angliae mutari and now that dr johnson is gone to a bettr world i bow the intellectual knee to lord thurlow who with inflexible wisdom stops the tide of fashionable reform it was johnson who confirmed me in my opinion of that mighty sage of the law and the constitution before his promotion to the high office for which he seems to have been formed on purpose the doctor said of him i honor thurlow sir  thurlow is a fine fellow he fairly puts his mind to yours  long long may he put his mind against those who would take even one stone out of that venerable fabric which is the wonder of the world  mistake me not my countrymen as if i had changed my opinion against the nominal and fictitious votes in our counties these are no part of our old constitution they are modern tricks invented by cunning lawyers to cheat the real freeholders these will i hope  these shall be abolished while i would sacredly guard the constitution i would sweep from it the cobwebs with all their vermin  innovation frightens me because i never can be sure what will come next hitherto shall thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed is not for mortals to say my lord marchmont did me the honor of a visit a few years ago and made a remark which still vibrates in my ear sir this country has been governed by wise men and we have had no notion what mischief fools could do  at another time talking of this very subject of lessening the number of judges in scotland which has been formerly mooted his lordship said no it must not be scotland is far from the sun of government and must be lighted by many lustres  there the bright flame was shot through marchmonts foul   the present attempt puts me in mind of one of the many good stories which i have heard my father tell  an earl of seaforth took it into his head that he would pull down bran castle the ancient seat of his family the clan was alarmed the caperfey the deers head the crest of the mackenzies was displayed the brave mackenzies took fire assembled and came to him in a body my lord this shall not be wiser men than you built this castle you shall not demolish it  there was the true spirit of clanship not a slavish subjection to an individual but a voluntary attachment to their patriarchal father and lord  to the family  to the throne  i abhor annihilation  and five of our judges shall not perish if i can prevent it  what in the name of goodness is the motive to this violent measure does the country complain that there are too many judges no  do the judges themselves complain i trust no  for what i pray you is the court of session why it is an aggregate of fourteen separate and distinct subordinate courts and one court of appeal there are fourteen ordinary lords each of these has his own roll of causes in one half of which his judgment is allowed to be final the court of appeal is the whole body of those lord ordinaries with the lord president at their head and this court of appeal sits five days in the week to review judgments of the ordinaries  now let us consider how business is done in this court or more properly speaking in these courts it is done chiefly in writing and most voluminous writing it is there are minutes representations answers replies duplies triplies memorials hinc inde  cum multis aliis que nunc perscribere longum est so that each process as the papers in a suit are called makes a thick bundle which is carried to the judges house and this he must peruse and afterward put his interlocutor upon it in writing and authenticate it by his subscription now i know and every man acquainted with the court knows and it can be proved by all the members of the college of justice that it is with the utmost difficulty that even the fourteen judges whom we have can get through the business with reasonable dispatch how is it possible then that it can be done by a third fewer people be they ever so laborious nine dukes of richmond could not do it  i could see some meaning in diminishing the court of review and letting only the ten senior judges or perhaps the five senior judges sit in the inner house that the court of review might move quicker by being less unwieldy and the other judges might have more time to ripen and decide causes in the first instance which is the most laborious part of the business that i could understand as coming within the power conceded in the articles of union to make regulations but to make the laborers few when the harvest truly is great seems to me to be very strange policy  and here i have an argumentum ad homines i will not believe that the lords of session themselves are so unconscientious as to approve of this measure though rumor with all her tongues has wantonly said they are for it my argument is this  there is not one of them who has not again and again said what i have just now stated that the duty of his office is very great and that in sessiontime he is quite harrassed he has so much to do  will they then undertake to do more that they may get a little more money i hope not as it must be sure that they are perfectly innocent of so heavy a charge i may put it in strong words  either they have been liars or they mean to be cheats that is the infamous charge which their approbation of lessening their number without lessening or shortening the business of the court would involve  i beg ten thousand pardons for even uttering such coarse epithets but my indignation is roused that any creature whatever should have the audacity to impute to the judges of my country so abominable an alternative  quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri sacra fames is an exclamation which keeps pace with mankind from age to age but surely we ought to suppose judges have learnt better things and have extirpated from their hallowed breasts the root of all evil  how injurious is it to imagine they will be like some impudent sluts who for more wages will undertake to be both cookmaid and chambermaid  delicate coalition  the lords of session are or should be gentlemen shall we make them a parcel of scrubs  of a monday i drive the coach of a tuesday i drive the plough on a wednesday i follow the hounds a thursday i dun the tenants on friday i go to market on saturday i draw warrants and a sunday i draw beer  suppose it should be thought right to increase the salaries of the lords of session is there no way of doing it but making twothirds of them devour the rest like pharaohs lean and fat kine is the state so poor that we must adopt a measure similar to the barbarous permission in china and otaheite to murder their children lest they should not have food enough six thousand pounds a year would make them up l 000 each and cannot that miserable sum be spared off some corner of the sinecure establishment i persuade myself that the people of scotland themselves would submit to a census in order to ransom their court if the judges are poor let them hold out the mendicant pouch and receive our benevolence i for one would cheerfully pay my quota rather than suffer so dangerous an amputation to be botchingly performed upon our old judicial body  but is it quite clear that there should be an augmentation of their salaries the lord president has already l  00 a year every ordinary lord has better than six hundred guineas and six of their number are also lords of justiciary of whom the lord justice clerk has l 00 a year and each of the other five has l 00 a year besides every one of those six is allowed l 00 a year for circuit expenses and now that they have obtained an act of parliament allowing them to stay only three days at each assizetown instead of six as they were formerly obliged to do  while the same allowance for expenses is quietly continued they have upon my word very comfortable provisions the justiciary gown is an excellent object of ambition and an encouragement for laudable exertion to the ordinary lords but even without that they have a very decent premium from the state and may live very well in scotland as judges should live not in rioting and drunkenness indeed but in grave abstraction as becomes their office dr souths pulpit joke upon the wages of sin being death  poor wages that a man cannot live by  will not in my opinion apply to all offices the state in many cases is only to help a man to live not wholly to support him the state should enable him fully to defray the additional expense occasioned by the office which he holds but he is a hungry hound indeed who comes into an office of respect and experience such as that of a judge with nothing at all of his own neither family estate nor fortune acquired by practice i own i should think a man in such circumstances ought not to be made a judge either his birth must be mean  his abilities small  or his conduct imprudent  were there a difficulty to find men of merit willing to be made lords of session by reason of the salary being too small i could understand this procrustian expedient but let us at least wait till that is the case which well mr dundas knows it is not as yet by any means will he tell me that the salary of that office is not sufficiently considerable for which mr alexander gordon brother to the earl of aberdeen uncle to the duke of gordon and a man of good understanding experience and integrity solicited for years and  pudet haec opprobria might perhaps have been soliciting still had not a political wave in the tempest of last year thrown him into port  an office desired by mr john maclaurin filius colini fama super aethera noti and a son of no common talents  an office which would be accepted by mr william nairne our vicedean whose character truly exhibits a heavenborn judge  an office which would comfort which would satisfy mr george wallace whose knowledge application and honesty none will deny whom lord mansfield has praised but not promoted laudatur et alget  i could with pleasure give a long list of my deserving brethren to us it is not fair it is unjust to lessen the number of prizes after the lottery has begun drawing after we by an expensive education and much time and labor have purchased our tickets in the faith that our chance for a prize is to be what it ever has been as for myself i do most certainly believe that i am now writing from pure motives because i have at present no wish for the serious and important office of a lord of session i have a confidence perhaps too great a confidence in my abilities and therefore will try my fortune for some time at least in a wider sphere but this i declare that though the situation seems to me too confined i never thought the salary too small  let us be cautious of augmenting the salaries of our judges judges like men of genius and learning nutriendi sunt non saginandi  a gown in scotland should not be too good a place lest it become altogether an object of political preferment we have already several noble lords who are of the faculty of advocates and who might perhaps condescend to take such a loaf lord salton might think it a snug thing my cousin lord cathcart might see it to be better than a regiment lord stair might add it to his finances lord cassillis might choose it by way of otium cum dignitate  and the gentlemen whom i have mentioned with an erskine a blair an abercrombie a grant a cullen and all the rest who have honorably borne the heat of the day might languish and die without ever obtaining that rank to which they will in justice be entitled  take the scottish bench as it is now endowed  take it in a pecuniary view it is a tontine for our sons in no country in europe but scotland is the profession of the law an etat a rank many a gentleman with us enters advocate merely to have a feather in his cap the prime society of edinburgh is lawyers they give the tone as arbitri elegantiarum they rule the theater they make balls for the ladies and once i suppose to show the prodigious extent of their power they let the nation know that they could proscribe even a beautiful duchess the very soul of gay festivity black law black is the common dress of the gentlemen of edinburgh by choice as at geneva and lucca by an oeconomical regulation of the state a sumptuary law and hence when foot was amongst us he used to call black the edinburgh hunt it exalts our gentlemen to think they may be judges as by calculation it has been found that there are two vacancies for every three years they are continually looking upwards  os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri jussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus i must speak plain and say that i fear this crude scheme of diminishing the number of the lords of session has something in it more dangerous than you are aware of more is meant than meets the ear a politicians lust of power is exorbitant if he can but have the supreme tribunal of scotland of his own forming what may he not do to say nothing of our property it is now very well understood that the whole political interest of scotland is in the hands of the lords of session for they ascertain the validity of all the votes whether in our counties or in our boroughs and when we afterward bring our contested elections before a committee of the house of commons we have the mortification to find that mr grenvilles bill is to us on the north of the tweed as if it were not in vain do we plead in vain do we press upon the committee the absurdity the gross iniquity of an interlocutor a resolute caledonian nominee tells them the case has been decided by the only competent court which statutes have invested with the exclusive power of trying votes  and honest john bull believes this and acquiesces never considering that the great law of parliament the inherent right of the house of commons to judge of the qualifications of its own members must ever be paramount to the jurisdiction of particular subordinate courts  i am sorry mr george byng that i cannot appeal to you at present as a member of parliament for the truth of what i am maintaining for though i differ from you in my political creed as far as the east is from the west i think you an useful and active watchman of the state and i am never unmindful of your civility to me as a counsel when you sat chairman of the ayrshire committee but you may tell your friends who are in parliament and messieurs dudley long praed banks duncombe and several more who were of that committee will remember the piteous tale  i should oppose any diminution whatever of the number of the lords of session because it would make the laws delay be more grievously felt but above all i dislike this particular plot to revive the decemviri it is ominous in the words of livy i will say non placere nomen periculosum libertati esse  who seconded the kings advocates motion for leave to bring in this bill  this odious bill of pains and penalties  it was sir adam fergusson a man who has vexed me not a little by his political success in our county against my wishes he is one whom mr dundas has selected to hold up as an instance of the plenitude of his power  do any of you want to be informed of mr henry dundass power i dare say not care is taken that its full extent shall be proclaimed as far as orkney yet let us contemplate a striking instance it would make a picture for the exhibition or a scene at astleys behold him in your metropolis which the death of sir lawrence dundas left open to him  with his right hand he has moved the lord provost hunter blair gold chain and all from his political base  with his left he has thrust in as representative of the citizens of edinburgh  whom  a respectable merchant no  a prosperous tradesman no  a coutts the father of the great establishment in the strand london no  a kerr whom pelham loved no  a citizen of any sort good bad or indifferent no no no  whom then why sir adam fergusson advocate the late member for the county of air sir adam fergusson wrote a circular letter against peers interfering in our county election and several very worthy gentlemen joined the standard of independency as they imagined which he erected carrying them along with him and yet having his peers as well as we he contrived to possess for two parliaments the representation of ayrshire by means of those superiority votes which that county has declared to be nominal and fictitious while the real interest was unrepresented sir adam fergusson last year as we are told made overtures to the earl of eglintoune and formed a coalition with his lordship that he was not elected we know that he voted for his former opponent we know and it is said he supports the earls friend for one parliament and the earl is to make him member next parliament when the report of this curious agreement burst upon the county like a bomb and stunned men of all parties i made the following bellmans rhimes to usher in my friend colonel hugh montgomerie as our representative adam too long you have kept your seat with little for your pains trust me you will never make ends meet computing loss and gains surrender then to gallant hugh it truly will be best bring your mock votes along with you and laugh at all the rest thus ayrshire yet may prosperous be with such a brave commander and if youre pleased our joy to see that will indeed be candor the real interest  if he can i have never heard his lordship say that this report is true but if it is the noble earl must not take it amiss if some of the best friends of his family should disdain what they think degrading to him and feel obnoxious to themselves amongst those friends i myself am one of the warmest both as an enthusiast for ancient feudal attachments and as having the honor and happiness to be married to his lordships relation a true montgomerie whom i esteem whom i love after fifteen years as on the day when she gave me her hand  but i have an objection to sir adam fergusson on account of a paltry money question which being now under the arbitration of three of our lords of session i forbear to exhibit it till the result is known  mr macadam of craigengillan as able and as spirited a man as any in his majestys dominions and sir john whitefoord who is honor itself both gentlemen of extensive interest in ayrshire have also objections to him which they have stated to me and will tell any body who thinks it worth while to ask them  in these circumstances the house of eglintoune can hardly expect that the great county of air the yorkshire of scotland will be brought implicitly to wheel and vote for sir adam fergusson merely that a bargain which should never have been made may be fulfilled i myself have reason to hope that many of the real freeholders of ayrshire will support me at the election for next parliament against which i have declared myself a candidate colonel montgomerie has had the great honor of being chosen by the real freeholders may i not have it in my turn ed anche io son pittore by the time this parliament is over he may be content to be vejanius armis herculis ad postem fixis  i shall certainly stand upon the substantial interest of the gentlemen of landed property and if upon a fair trial i should not succeed in that object of ambition which i have most ardently at heart i have resources enough to prevent me from being discontented or fretful perhaps sir adam fergusson may support me why should he not i know of no objection the honorable baronet can have to me though i am sorry that i have an objection to the honorable baronet i have asked his vote and interest by a letter his answer has neither granted nor refused my application he waves it on the common civil ground that it is too soon to decide in the mean time i shall endeavor to deserve the support of the real freeholders by exerting myself as much as i possibly can to serve either the county in general or individuals of it and when a man does the best he can he may perhaps have his reward but this countrycity member has led me off from edinburgh to which i now return and i do say that if issuing an effectual conge delire by which sir adam fergusson is made member for the capital of scotland be not power with a witness i am at a loss to conceive what power is  as to all this power assumed by mr dundas i must say miror but i certainly do not blame him as cato says when his gallant son marcus is brought in dead who would not be that youth  the proverb says a living dog is better than a dead lion what then must a living lion be but under what genus under what species are they to be ranked whose pusillanimity is the cause that this lion alone domineers in the forest our late and present situation brings to my remembrance some verses in an old poem which i have heard my father repeat they are a kind of imprecation applicable to a coalition which in the last age took place in scotland  may also these men of many wiles ambages may eke thae men of money wimples sir james and sir john dalrymples with wi their new allies the dundases rule all aw our lords and lairds like asses yet i will do mr dundas the justice to declare that large as his power is he has not much abused it he has indeed taken very good care of his relations and why should he not though to be sure flesh and blood must feel his having put his young nephew over the heads of i know not how many of us as solicitor general but i do not believe that he has been cruel oppressive or vindictive i know but of two wrong things that he has done one was attacking sir lawrence dundas in the county of orkney in his own manor where he was a father to the people as that hospitable that splendid that imperial baronet said to me with tears in his eyes the other was persuading my honored father a venerable judge in the decline of his life to embark in county politics from which he had ceased for twenty years and make a parcel of unsubstantial votes which he abhorred in order to support sir adam fergusson in ayrshire against the old and the real interest of the county but both these instances were the effects of politics which i see to be poison to the mind i have therefore no more objection to mr dundass being sole protector of scotland than any other man if we must be so ruled nay i have an interest that he should be the person for there is an hereditary friendship between our families we were at college together we have often enjoyed  the happier hour of social pleasure   and i trust to the generosity of his feelings that as he knows he once did me a severe injury which i have from my heart forgiven he will be anxious to make me full amends if ever it shall be in his power the desire of elevation is as keen in me as in himself though i am not so well fitted for party exploits  as nero wished that the people of rome had but one neck that he might if he pleased cut them off at a single stroke  so a deep an artful politician will be desirous to contract the body which he wishes to command it is easier driving four horses in hand than six besides while there are fifteen judges the danger that they may not be all tractable is proportionally multiplied when compared with the number ten there may be a proud an eloquent alemoor who will watch like a dragon  a sturdy elliock who will not bend  a firm stonefield who not only has a will of his own but if one in high place trusting that he is sheltered in his situation presumes to be coarsely insolent can tell it him in his ear aye and to his beard  an honorable rockville who being of higher rank than any of them before he became a judge will not stoop  will not truckle  will not be led  but will deliver his own honest good sense with the mild dignity that becomes him  it is very agreeable to consider that one bad judge cannot contaminate a number who are good yet when we take the converse of the proposition we shall find one good judge can prevent the evil of many bad ones he can hold up truth and justice so conspicuously that bad judges have not hardiness enough to turn aside from them and if they should he can alarm the country when a man of probity and spirit a lord newhall whose character is ably drawn in prose by the late lord president arniston father of the treasurer of the navy and elegantly in verse by mr hamilton of bangour  when such a man sits among our judges should they be disposed to do wrong he can make them hear and tremble my honored father told me that sir walter pringle spoke as one having authority even when he was at the bar he would cram a decision down their throats  duncan forbes of culloden when lord president of the court gave every day as a toast at his table here is to every lord of session who does not deserve to be hangedl lord auchinleck and lord monboddo both judges but since his time are my authority for this i do not say that the toast was very delicate or even quite decent but it may give some notion what sort of judges there may be it is well known that forbes by the single weight of his character assiduously and boldly urged made a very great alteration to the better upon the court and showed unum hominem pluris valuisse quam civitatem  a number of judges taken from different parts of the country diffuses and divides that private and imperceptible influence which must ever be in a narrow country one prejudice is checked and counterbalanced by another a judge from the north of the tay is corrected by a judge from the south of the tay and is again corrected by him in his turn  i solemnly declare i mean no reflection against the lords of session farther than that they are not exempted from the frailties incident to man  that human nature is human nature every where and in a narrow country is more liable than in a great country to what i shall call  honest bias  with a plausible appearance it has been propagated from company to company that were there fewer lords of session there would be more security from their responsibility as disgrace which is light when shared amongst a number falls heavy upon a few  but against this you shall have an unanswerable argument  if they are honest and honorable men they will not be the less so that they are fifteen if they are not and mean to do wrong a junto of ten can do it with more facility non meus hic sermo est i owe it to lord palmerston from whose conversation there is always something to be borrowed i humbly thank his lordship for it and beg he may pardon my imperfect report of it he gave it me at lord ossorys i cannot refrain from mentioning the place because i am very vain to fit at the table of fitzpatrick the respect for whose ancient and noble blood is not lessened but increased by the character of its present representative which as i feel is saying a great deal i flatter myself fitzpatrick was convinced if he was  i will answer for it all the world shall not make him flinch  and now my countrymen let me entreat you to assemble again in your counties and boroughs and corporations and public bodies of every kind and petition parliament against diminishing the number of the lords of session unless parliament will totally alter the judicial procedure of scotland upon some wise plan after it has received your approbation i would also have you to address the king against so alarming a measure it is the glory of the reign of george iii that he has given independency to his judges his majesty will graciously listen to what you humbly and honestly tell him relative to what he has much at heart  the good administration of justice in his dominions  do not despond and imagine that english members of parliament will be totally inattentive to what so much concerns you my old classical companion wilkes with whom i pray you to excuse my keeping company he is so pleasant did indeed once tell me when i asked him to attend a scottish contest in the house of commons no no damn it not i i will have nothing to do with it i care not which prevails it is only goth against goth  but he is now an older member of the great council of the nation and i hope will not grudge to take a little trouble for you by way of doing penance for his biting and scratching in the north briton  you may hope for aid from the lord rector of the university of glasgow mr burke who dislikes and dreads reform in parliament who spoke this very session against it like an angel and whose benignant heart will feel for your just anxiety to mr burke i was much obliged when he was in power and it grieved me that he embraced what in all sincerity i thought such a measure as justified his removal from office  for his interest is dear to me as my own by his removal the kings administration was deprived of the assistance of that affluent mind which is so universally rich that as long as british literature and british politics shall endure it will be said of edmund burke regum equabat opes animis  you will be listened to by my gallant colonel james wortley stuart who for sterling good sense information discernment honor and honesty and spirit is not exceeded by any of them as diminishing the number of our judges would diminish the influence of the crown he probably will not like it  you will be listened to by that brave irishman i have always stood up for the irish in whose fine country i have been hospitably and jovially entertained and with whom i feel myself to be much congenial in my tour to corsiea after relating from general paoli a remarkable instance of bravery in carew an irish officer at the siege of tortona i thus do generous justice to the irish in opposition to the english and scots  it is with pleasure that i record an anecdote so much to the honor of a gentleman of that nation on which illiberal reflections are too often thrown by those of whom it little deserves them whatever may be the rough jokes of wealthy insolence or the envious sarcasms of needy jealousy the irish have ever been and will continue to be highly regarded upon the continent  my book was first published in      the irish were then still under a cloud what a glorious day has burst upon them now quod felix faustumque sit captain macbride the cousin of my wife and the friend of my heart a man whose valor has resounded in so many parts of the ocean and whose seat in parliament has not been purchased by bribery of servility but given him by a free election he has come into the house of commons borne upon the swelling bosoms of the worthy electors of plymouth who knowing him best are the best judges of his merit and have been most eager to reward it by a triumphant testimony such as heroes were honored with in old rome  i think you may also depend upon mr lee with whom my intimacy has been chiefly formed since i made him dangle at the end of a rope as attorney general in my east india letter  what liberality of mind must he have  though he is not such a bigot as i am and would be glad to have some reform in parliament yet i dare say when he is made acquainted with the state of this case he will manfully oppose the attempt i love mr lee exceedingly though i believe there are not any two specific propositions of any sort in which we exactly agree but the general mass of sense and sociality literature and religion in each of us produces two given quantities which unite and effervesce wonderfully well to his great reputation as a barrister my voice can add nothing but he has kindly enabled me to bear testimony to his private worth i know few men i would go farther to serve than jack lee  have confidence in sir matthew white ridley that stately that pleasing northumbrian who exhibits an instance of what it is strange should be rare  independent opulence  he was a general in the late tumultuous parliament army he fought he encouraged and he cheered  with a fight on my merry men all  till his wisdom and his tenderness for his country prevailed over his pride and he was the first to sall back and give the signal for retreat if my sanguine hope has not deceived me sir matthew will be for us  i even think it possible that you may be protected by the man  i will not say of the people  for i am too much in earnest to fill my mouth with party cant away away with blue and buff and all such wretched foolish stuff the times pale cast which  johnson in his dictionary has to sickly v a from the adjective to make diseased to taint with the hue of disease not in use but it shall be in use it is a word of power we cannot do without it sicklies you demands a grave  a solemn hue but i will say the man of great of extraordinary abilities  of most extensive of infinite political knowledge  who can do much good if he will and we may hope he shall when the adjustment of circumstances above my reach will let him  yes my friends mr fox may protect you his clear understanding can at once distinguish between a reform which promises some beneficial consequence and a demolition which it is demonstrated must be ruinous  and shall we be so unjust to the minister of the crown to the second william pit as to apprehend that he will not hear us he who first took he who still holds the reins of government with the hearty concurrence the generous applause of an admiring nation he whose nobleness of soul has so remarkably shown how open he is to conviction i can have no doubt that when he has made himself master of the subject sees that the articles of the union would be infringed and knows how very unpopular this bill is  i can have no doubt that he will send for the minister for scotland and tell him in a determined tone dundas dundas for shame here is a rock upon which we might have split as fox did upon his india bill i will hear no more of this court of session job it is a monstrous measure let it be quashed  great sir forgive my thus presumptuously thus rashly attempting for a moment to forge your thunder but i conjure you  in the name of god and the king i conjure you  to announce in your own lofty language that there shall be a stop put to this conspiracy which i fear might have the effect of springing a mine that would blow up your administration believe me sincere when i now tell you that although i with all deference cannot join you in one point  a reform in parliament  for the reasons i have given  such is my confidence in your talents and virtues such my sense of the good you have done and my hope of the good you are yet to do that though not blessed with high heroic blood but rather i think troubled with a natural timidity of personal danger which it costs me some philosophy to overcome i ampersuaded i have so much real patriotism in my breast that i should not hesitate to draw my sword in your defense it is the royal cause i tremble at the recollection of that parliamentary anarchy from which your magnanimity delivered us a return of such confusion would be now a more dreadful calamity we should be forced in wild dismay to exclaim chaos is come again  my countrymen have i not heartened you somewhat by pointing out to you so many eminent men to whom we may fly for refuge and obtain it  sir george saville whose name though he be dead is enough to rouse every dormant spark of public spirit had a political maxim which is striking and i believe will be found true he said that in whatever way any nation was governed for any considerable time it ought to be governed in that manner it was proved by experience that that kind of government was adapted to that people if they maintained their freedom they ought to be free if they submitted to slavery they ought to be slaves this letter was printed thus far    may      when i had the honor to dine in company with mr justice wills to whom i am indebted for many civilities at the court holden at the old bailey london and he told us from his father my lord chief justice wills that when his father was no more than a kings counsel he visited john duke of argyll at his seat at adderbury he found him sitting in his great chair and a number of the nobility and gentry of scotland standing round him  vulgi stante corona  the great vulgar are certainly worse than the small the duke said my dear wills will not you have a chair and mr wills was accordingly seated but not one of those nobility and gentry presumed to sit in his graces presence he was the minister for scotland  o servum pecus  do not i beseech you my countrymen allow prescription to run against you do not let your equity of redemption be foreclosed  what says our own fletcher of saltoun there is not perhaps in human affairs any thing so unaccountable as the indignity and cruelty with which mankind suffer themselves to be used under pretense of government  when peter the great czar of muscovy was in england he wished to see the punishment of keelhailing he asked the king to show it him sir said he i cannot unless a man be found who deserves it  that shall be no objection said the czar take one of my fellows  the king of england nobly replied know sir that when a man of any nation whatever has set his foot upon english ground he is a freeman he is entitled to the protection of the laws of this country  the application of this illustrious anecdote to the protection which the people of scotland may expect from english members of parliament is very obvious we are now one people though a river here there an ideal line divides what once were only sister kingdoms are not we then on the north of the tweed to participate of british moderation in government as well as those on the south of the tweed and are any despots of our own land to be permitted to oppress us i hope not  we may then say to the english members in the strong language of dr young in one of his tragedies  o guard us from ourselves  it will be in vain to attempt hurry and evasion and cajoling  it will be in vain to employ what powers of lively ridicule our taskmasters possess and to represent this alarm to be similar to the absurd hueandcry against the change of the style which hogarth so exquisitely burlesques give us our eleven days  give us our five lords of session  believe me it is no joke and it cannot be made like a joke a violation of the articles of the union and an extinction of one third of our judicial relief which is even now inadequate to the wants of our country are serious things or else there is nothing serious in mortality shall one of the troubles of life which make the pensive hamlet balance whether one ought to throw off the burden of it be augmented by another shall the laws delay be rendered still more tedious by stretching the insolence of office  in my zeal to prevent what appears to me a most pernicious innovation i may have been somewhat intemperate in my expression i hope allowance will be made for it for though agitated and indignant i am free from rancour i write for both sides of the tweed though my warning letter goes directly to scotland i mean that it should reverberate on england but it would hurt me very much if by any misapprehension it could possibly be thought that any extensive severity in this pamphlet for pauca macula there will ever be in all human institutions is pointed against the honorable judges who at present compose the court of session under the authority of which i have practiced the law lo these nineteen years  most potent grave and reverend signors my very noble and approved good masters and therefore though i can scarcely for a moment suppose it necessary i do now in most explicit terms disavow an intention so injurious i have argued hypothetically and we all know that an hypothesis referable to a distant and imagined period which i trust shall never arrive may be formed as strongly and even extravagantly as imagination can figure  but the permanency of the constitution of the court as fixed by article    of the treaty of union is not imaginary for in corrobaration of the passage which i have already transcribed i beg leave to add that after specifying the qualifications then requisite for lords of session that same article of the treaty says yet so as the qualifications made or to be made for capacitating persons to be named ordinary lords of session may be altered by the parliament of great britain does not this make it perfectly clear that the constitution of the court may not be altered exceptio firmat regulam in casibus non exceptis  in a former part of this letter i suggested as a regulation of improvement upon the administration of justice in our unalterable court of session that the ten senior judges or only the five senior judges should sit in the inner house as the court of review but it now occurs to me that it is not always certain that the oldest judges will be the wisest and therefore i would rather have them to sit seven and seven alternately with the president four with him or a presiding judge in his room to make a quorum to review the separate decisions of the ordinary lords let the suitors have time to make their election of either of those courts of seven let the president deliver his opinion but have no vote unless where there happens to be an equality of voices and as at present no decree is final till after two consecutive judgments of the inner house let there for the second judgment be a privilege to obtain a new trial before the whole fifteen as at present upon cause shown and let the whole fifteen sit one week in each month for rejecting or receiving such applications and deciding upon them my suggestions are offered with great diffidence but they are all legal they do not infringe the sacred constitution of the college of justice  i have one other circumstance to communicate but it is of the highest value i communicate it with a mixture of awe and fondness  that great personage who is allowed by all to have the best memory of any man born a briton and is known by those who know him best to have a very sound understanding and a very humane heart may probably recollect that in a conversation with one of the most zealous royalists of the age he was graciously pleased to give general paoli the just praise of putting law into a people who were lawless  what barbarous oppression what political guilt would it be in part to extinguish law amongst a brave people who have long enjoyed it and who agreed to the abolition of their own government upon the faith of unalterable articles of union in consequence of which they are now at a great distance from the seat of government to which it is not easy for their voice to extend  this letter hastily written upon the spur of the occasion is already too long yet allow me my friends and countrymen while i with honest zeal maintain your cause  allow me to indulge a little more my own egotism and vanity they are the indigenous plants of my mind they distinguish it i may prune their luxuriancy but i must not entirely clear it of them for then i should be no longer as i am and perhaps there might be something not so good virtus laudata crescit  sum superbiam quesitam meritis i last year claimed the credit of being no timeserver i think i am giving pretty good proof that i am not so this year neither though ambitious i am uncorrupted and i envy not high situations which are attained by the want of public virtue in men born without it or by the prostitution of public virtue in men born with it though power and wealth and magnificence may at first dazzle and are i think most desirable no wise man will upon sober reflection envy a situation which he feels he could not enjoy my friend my maecenas atavis edite regibus lord mountstuart flattered me once very highly without intending it  i would do any thing for you said he but bring you into parliament for i could not be sure but you might oppose me in something the very next day  his lordship judged well though i should consider with much attention the opinion of such a friend  before taking my resolution  most certainly i should oppose him in any measure which i was satisfied ought to be opposed i cannot exist with pleasure if i have not an honest independence of mind and of conduct for though no man loves good eating and drinking simply considered better than i do  i prefer the broiled bladebone of mutton and humble port of downright shippen to all the luxury of all the statesmen who play the political game all through  it is my system to regard in a public capacity  measures and not men in a private capacity  men and not measures i can discuss topics of literature or any other topics with mitred st asaph with wyndham of norfolk with capel loft with dr kippis with dr price with the reverend mr john palmer yet there are points of government in some of them and points of faith in others as to which had i any thing to do in the administration of this country i should withstand them to the face i can drink i can laugh i can converse in perfect good humor with whigs with republicans with dissenters with independents with quakers with moravians with jews they can do me no harm my mind is made up my principles are fixed but i would vote with tories and pray with a dean and chapter  while i arraign what strikes me as very wrong in mr henry dundas and the lord advocate in their public conduct i am ready to meet them on friendly but equal terms in private to the lord advocate i am most willing to allow all his merit he has risen to the head of our bar no man with us ever pushed the business of a lawyer to that extent that he has done he has made it a peruvian profession yet he is free from the sordidness which sometimes attends those who get a great deal of money by laborious employment upon every occasion that i have known him tried he was generous and he is a very friendly man i should be exceedingly ungrateful if i did not acknowledge it  that mr dundas and he should think of attempting such a bill as this must make us wonder and for a moment show us how weak the ablest men are upon some occasions i may without offense account for it by using the very expression of mr dundas himself when attacking at the bar of the house of lords a decree of the court of session in the case of a schoolmaster where i was counsel on the other side i can swear to the phrase  they have been seized with some infatuation  i cannot allow myself to imagine that mr dundas means to make poor scotland the scapegoat to be sacrificed on the altar of reform and to please the minister with a small one because he has been disappointed of a great he shall have a reform of the court of session since he cannot have a reform of parliament to which by the bye i did not know till the other day that mr dundas himself notwithstanding appearances has always been a friend  no no this cannot be william pit would despise such pitiful game aut caesar aut nihil is his motto  poor is the triumph over the timorous hare we must go to the aeneid for his prototype at puer ascanius mediis in vallibus acri gaudet equo jamque hos cursu jam superat illos spumantemque dari pecora inter inertia votis optat aprum aut fulvum descendere monte leonem   the suspicion of such a sacrifice could be hatched only in scotland where before the heretable jurisdictions were abolished a man was tried for his life in the court of one of the chieftains the jury were going to bring him in not guilty but somebody whispered them that the young lord had never seen an execution upon which their verdict was  death and the man was hanged  though our young minister has not yet seen a reform i hope the court of session shall be spared  then trust me percy pity it were and great offense to kill any of these our harmless men for they have done no ill i exhort you my friends and countrymen in the words of my departed goldsmith who gave me many nootes atticae and gave me a jewel of the finest water  the acquaintance of sir joshua reynolds  i again exhort you to fly from petty tyrants to the throne apply to the king the fountain of law justice and jurisdiction your application will not be in vain  my ingenious friend mr tyers in his admirable political conferences makes lord strafford defending to pym his attachment to charles i express the very thoughts in my breast  in my highest flights whilst a commoner my heart was never averse to monarchy i was then neither a puritan nor an arminian the more opportunities i possess of knowing the king the more strongly am i attached to his person and authority a king of england is not to be reduced to the insignificance of a doge of venice since the murder of buckingham who ruled i confess with a very high hand the king has no favorite he has taken upon him the task of being more his own minister and therefore you have not so much reason to apprehend any violation of popular rights  my much respected great grandfather that worthy gentleman david boswell of auchinleck thomas boswell was the first lord of auchinleck pronounced affleck ayrshire after the estate had fallen to the crown by the forfeiture of the very ancient family of that ilk i e of the same name there being no record nor tradition of any other family having it i am told the afflecks of england are the heirs of the forfeited family i am proud of the connection but should be unwilling to resign to them the estate of which they have now no need thomas boswell was a descendant of the family of balmuto in fife whose estate was purchased in this century by a younger son of my family the wife of thomas boswell was a daughter of campbell of londoun and a granddaughter of the forfeited affleck he was honored in   0  with a charter from james iv of scotland dilecto familiari nostro  pro bono et fideli servitio nobis prestito he was killed with his king at the fatal field of flodden in      fighting against the english though he was himself of old yorkshire extraction being descended of the respectable family of bosville or boswell for both they and we have spelt it both ways at different times of gunthwait in the west riding after a separation for ages i united our branch in cordial friendship with the stock our chief the late godfrey bosville esquire as honest a man as perfect an example of the noblest work of god as ever breathed that friendship is continued with his son william bosville esquire who with his fathers honest heart has the curiosity of ulysses which he has gratified very extensively he is to let me have a freehold in yorkshire a small bit of the old manor which will connect us from generation to generation  if it should be asked what has this note to do here i answer  to illustrate the author of the text and to pour out all myself as old montaigne i wish all this to be known and you who censure it have read it and must therefore know it i am at home in yorkshire and i last year assisted at that glorious meeting where loyalty and liberty united in addressing his majesty  a true heart of oak with a vigorous mind and a robust body secured our male succession his uncle though he had four daughters the eldest of whom was married to lord cathcart who would have been glad to have had our old rock was feudal enough to give him the estate that lord used to say he never saw a man in his life that he did not think himself his master i pejor avis cannot say so much but this i will say that i call no man master without reserve when i have fixed my opinion upon an important question i maintain it as a point of conscience as a point of honor and the sovereign himself would find me tenacem propositi as i humbly but firmly was upon the subject of the american war i am a tory but not a slave  i am possessed of an essay dictated to me by dr johnson on the distinction between a whig and a tory in which it is shown by the wondrous powers of that illustrious mind that there is but a shade of difference between a moderate whig and a spirited tory  between reasonable men of each party much would i yield rather than shake the reverence due to majesty by opposition but there may come an enterprise of great moment as to which it would be deeply culpable to conceal my sentiments  as to which i may think myself obliged to be a faithful an intrepid an inflexible monitor  let me conclude with eclat  with one of the finest passages of john homes noble and elegant tragedy of douglas to the liege lord of my dear native land i owe a subjects homage but even him and his high arbitration i would reject within my bosom reigns another lord honor sole judge and umpire of itself   i have the honor to remain my friends and countrymen your very faithful humble servant james boswell london may      postscript since this letter was finished i have read  the rights of juries vindicated in the case of the dean of st asaph in the kings bench where mr erskine added so much to the luster of his professional character and inconsiderable as my approbation may be i cannot refrain from saying that mr welchs speech upon that occasion appears to me for legal knowledge acute reasoning and true constitutional spirit to be a masterly performance and to establish beyond question that the juries of england are judges of law as well as of fact in many civil and in all criminal trials let me be also permitted to add one to the number of his majestys subjects who heartily honor mr justice wills for his clear free yet temperate doctrine delivered as a judge not unworthy to have been one at the trial of the seven bishops  that my principles of resistance may not be misapprehended any more than my principles of submission i protest that i should be the last man in the world to encourage juries to contradict rashly wantonly or perversely the opinion of the judges on the contrary i would have them listen respectfully to the advice they receive from the bench by which they may often be well directed in forming their own opinion which and not anothers is the opinion they are to return upon their oaths but where after due attention to all that the judge has said they are decidedly of a different opinion from him they have not only a power and a right but they are bound in conscience to bring in a verdict accordingly thus it was in the late case of spence at edinburgh which i have mentioned the jury with every bias for the security of their own property and peace with every disposition as good citizens to check a desperate rage of mobbing were nevertheless satisfied that that young soldier my client then the prisoner at the bar upon the general issue compounded of law and of fact to use the evermemorable words of baron air in colonel gordons trial was not guilty of the felonious fireraising or arson with which he was charged and therefore they acquitted him at which my heart rebounded it is but justice to add that we have at edinburgh a most respectable gentleman sir william forbes of pitsligo who when sitting as a juryman and hearing one of the judges mutter audibly that the law must be left to the court rose in his place and with a proper courage asserted the full right of himself and his brethren which had a very good effect  in the press and speedily will be published in one volume octavo printed for charles dilly london the journal of a tour to the hebrides with samuel johnson l l d  by james boswell esquire  o while along the stream of time thy name expended flies and gathers all its fame say shall my little bark attendant fail pursue the triumph and partake the gole pope this journal which was read and liked by dr johnson will faithfully and minutely exhibit what he said was the pleasantest part of his life and while it gives the remarks which mr boswell himself was able to make during a very curious journey it will convey a specimen of that conversation in which wisdom and wit were equally conspicuous
