an extraordinary case of lacerated vagina at the full period of gestation  with observations tending to show that many cases related as ruptures of the uterus have been lacerations of the vagina  by william goldson member of the corporation of surgeons in london  exempla rara non reticenda etiam causa incognita ita enim scitu digna infinita praeteribuntur quare veritatis studiosus omne debet quod conspiciat etiamsi eum angat causa sedulo exponere  galen de cause pulls london printed for j murray no    fleet street and c elliot edinburgh  mdcclxxxvii  introduction ruptures of the uterus have been considered as accidents mortal for the most part in their nature when part of the child remains in utero authors give some general directions for delivery but agree in its fatal tendency if the child has escaped wholly into the cavity of the abdomen considering any attempts to deliver except by the caesarean operation as fruitless this was the opinion of dr hunter his high and deserved reputation has stamped such authority upon it that practitioners in general give up their patient for lost without attempting any thing for her relief the caesarian operation in this country has been attended with such ill success that very few men are bold enough to recommend it supposing that it would only be an addition to the patients sufferings without affording any prospect of relief  dr douglas physician to the asylum some months since published a case where he succeeded in the delivery of a child from the cavity of the abdomen and the woman recovered from whence he infers that those accidents which admit the child to escape through a rupture of the uterus are not necessarily fatal and that the delivery is to be effected without having recourse to the caesarean operation with more ease than has been imagined  the case which is now submitted to the consideration of the public was a laceration of the vagina happening early in parturition the circumstances of which having been clearly marked during the life of the patient and confirmed by dissection after her death throws a new light upon this part of midwifery and renders it probable that many cases deemed irremediable from being considered as ruptures of the uterus were only lacerations of the vagina and admitted of effectual assistance from art  this case having given rise to many doubts upon the subject of ruptured uterus induced me to enquire how far authors in general have been accurate in their observations upon examining such cases as were in my possession i found that many which are related as ruptures of the uterus were in fact lacerations of the vagina instances of which i shall give in cases from vander wiel bonetus dr douglas pouteau and others  from a case communicated to me by a friend i am further enabled to give some account of the circumstances attending a laceration of the vagina when the head being so low as to be wedged in the pelvis the child did not escape into the cavity of the abdomen on examining the circumstances of some cases described as proceeding from ruptures of the uterus this appears sometimes to have happened without being discovered  the observations annexed respecting the circumstances in which lacerations of the vagina differ from ruptures of the uterus in the escape of the child or placenta into the abdomen and the obstructions to delivery and the other practical inferences drawn are such as i hope will merit the attention of practitioners  as dr douglass observations on an extraordinary case of ruptured uterus is the latest publication on the subject i shall have occasion to advert to it oftener than to any other if it has been any means of dispelling the idea of the impossibility of recovery in accidents of this nature which has so long been the general received opinion supported by the highest authorities i flatter myself that the following pages will be a further inducement to dispel our fears as they tend to prove the great probability there is that the escape of the child into the cavity of the abdomen happens oftener from lacerations of the vagina than from ruptures of the uterus  wm goldson portsmouth common march         n extraordinary case of lacerated vagina on august the  0th      i was desired by mr william waller of gosport to visit mrs wilkins with my partner mr aylward she was a patient of mr wallers and had been above twenty four hours in labor after the membranes had broke and the os internum been considerably dilated the labor pains suddenly went off the childs head could be no longer felt and very dangerous symptoms had come on we met there in consultation his father and dr waller  mrs wilkins was a large woman much used to laborious exercise of a dark complexion about thirtysix years of age inclining to be lusty her constitution was naturally strong and generally healthy she was then in labor with her fourth child her former labors had been always lingering but was at each time delivered of a living child without more than ordinary assistance during the present pregnancy she was not able to move with so much ease as with her former children complaining of much pain in the left hypogastrium  we were informed by mr waller that he was called to her assistance about a fortnight before but finding that the pains were spurious he ordered her an opiate which gave her relief and she continued easy until the preceding day when being again sent to about six oclock in the morning he then found her in labor after waiting some time the pains beginning to increase he made an examination and found that the os internum was dilated to the size of a crown piece the membranes broke and the waters were evacuated upon a further examination in the usual manner the head was found to present but being only able to reach it with the point of his finger he could not exactly ascertain its situation in respect to vertex or fontinel considering it a lingering labor he waited for the efforts of nature the childs head advanced by slow degrees and after some hours the prospect of a more speedy delivery seemed to be apparent by the further dilatation of the os internum although the head did not appear to be much engaged in the pelvis she was about this time seized with a cramp in her left foot and leg which afterward extended to her belly on the return of every pain while he was directing a camphorated anodyne liniment another severe pain came on which caused her to cry out most vehemently oh the cramp the cramp and which she afterward said she believed was in her womb this was soon after followed by a discharge of blood from the vagina which continued for some time  mr waller then observed that the labor pains abated in their strength and that they were succeeded by such as are common in colic with peculiar twisting in her bowels he directed an emollient glyster which was repeated with an anodyne but not finding so much relief from these as he expected her pulse being full and quick he took away about eight ounces of blood from her arm and left her about two oclock giving directions that she might be kept as cool as possible the weather being very warm  he saw her again between four and five oclock and found that the true labor pains had not returned but that in addition to the other symptoms she then complained of considerable thirst had vomited frequently was very restless in great pain when moved and felt a great degree of pain when he put his hand upon her belly upon examining the state of the labor he could feel no presentation the childs head having receded in this situation he thought it proper to repeat the glyster and ordered her in the evening another anodyne together with a saline julep with hopes that real and efficient pains would return by the morning he left her  on visiting her in the morning very early her attendants informed him that she had been very thirsty and restless all night her vomiting had been more severe and that she was in great pain when turned complaining of a heavy lump which sell from side to side it did not appear from an inspection of the cloths that there had been any further hemorrhage upon inquiring more particularly it could not be found that she had made any urine except as it came away involuntarily  on considering that there had been no return of real pains and that the other symptoms were more urgent he began to think that her case was of a more serious nature than he had at first apprehended he therefore thought it proper to acquaint her friends with the opinion he entertained of the danger of her situation requesting them to send for such other persons of the faculty as they might wish should be consulted  when we visited her which was about noon we found her extremely restless complaining of great pain about the region of the pubis her face was covered with a cold sweat her pulse was moderately full and rapid she felt great anxiety about the praecordia her breathing was thick and short with intense thirst and continual efforts to vomit as it was observed that she had made no water for some time except what by the urinous smell of the cloths appeared to have come away involuntarily we determined to introduce the catheter but nothing passed except a little bloody sanies the bleeding was repeated and an antiphlogistic treatment agreed upon  when we considered her situation more fully and compared the several symptoms of cramp and succeeding hemorrhage the retrocession of the child her severe thirst vomiting and great pain about the region of the pubis with the symptoms which occurred in the case of ruptured uterus published by dr douglas there was such similarity between them that we agreed in the propriety of introducing the hand for a more particular examination  we accordingly visited her again about three oclock and mr william waller proceeded to make an examination there was no difficulty in passing his hand upon the posterior part he felt a considerable tumor which was moveable and which was not the childs head he likewise found his hand in contact with the intestines whence it was evident that our suspicions were well grounded immediate delivery was the only means of relief and his endeavors to get at the feet soon succeeded they were brought into the vagina and secured with a noose but it required a considerable degree of exertion to disengage the breech after the arms were brought down the head followed with ease little or no discharge ensuing  the child was large and had been dead no doubt ever since its escape from the uterus the placenta which was likewise in the cavity of the abdomen followed without any difficulty  not being determined as to the nature of the tumor which mr waller felt upon the posterior part as the woman had suffered so little in delivery we concurred in opinion that he should again examine the state of the parts upon introducing his hand he soon sound that the tumor receded before his fingers and that it was the contracted uterus it was evident to him that the uterus was not ruptured but that there was a laceration of the vagina at the place where it is attached to the cervix uteri through which his hand would pass with ease into the cavity of the abdomen the os internum was so contracted that it would not admit more than two fingers and he was convinced that it had not been injured she sound herself considerably relieved when we lest her at four oclock an anodyne was directed to be taken in the evening     st  we visited her early in the morning when we found that her spirits were good her attendants informed us that she had passed a much better night than could have been expected she was capable of turning without any inconvenience her thirst pain in the abdomen and vomiting were still violent anodynes with salt of wormwood and lemon juice to be taken during the effervescence were directed for her she had frequent stools with tenesmus the nurse was ordered to let her drink be mint tea with rice gruel  the symptoms evidently arising from the injury done to the abdominal viscera by the childs remaining so long among them after its escape from the uterus induced us to entertain some rays of hope from the success which had attended the case related by dr douglas that she might recover but the approach of the evening convinced us that our hopes were groundless every symptom was become more urgent with a very distressing sense of suffocation from globus hystericus she had made no water and from the urinous smell of the cloths we could not entertain the least doubt but that the bladder was ruptured specially when we called to our recollection that the same had been observed before delivery  in this distressing state nothing was lest for us to do more than to alleviate her pain and make the small remainder of her life as easy as possible for which purpose her anodyne medicines were repeated     d  the persons who watched with her during the night informed us that she had been very restless complained of great pain in her belly with intense thirst and that she had been constantly vomiting her countenance was greatly altered the quantity of fluid thrown up was out of all proportion to the quantity drank the tenesmus still continued but without any evacuations her anodynes were repeated and an opiate glyster ordered to be injected in the evening     d  we found her more composed and we understood she had been so through the greater part of the night she continued in the same state until about eleven oclock before noon when she died perfectly sensible  we obtained permission to open the body the same evening  the abdomen was much tumified upon making a longitudinal incision through the integuments a quantity of confined air rushed out the peritoneum was inflamed and in some places beginning to sphacelate the intestines were remarkably distended with flatus their external coats were tinged with yellow and inflamed through their whole extent the ramifications of the vessels appeared of a beautiful red as if they had been injected some spots were observed in several places beginning to sphacelate and they were for the most part connected by a slight adhesion to each other the omentum was contracted and inflamed there was a considerable quantity of bloody serum in the cavity of the abdomen the whole of the viscera had that appearance which has been generally observed on dissecting women who have died of a puerperal fever  the uterus and its appendages in situ appeared perfectly sound excepting the left ovarium which contained about fourteen ounces of a colorless fluid in a single cyst there was no appearance of the vesica urinaria on passing a catheter it went immediately into the cavity of the abdomen confirming our suspicion that the bladder was ruptured on raising the uterus above the pelvis we were immediately convinced how accurate mr waller had been in the description he gave us on examining the state of the parts directly after delivery  the os internum and cervix uteri were uninjured the vagina was thin and was lacerated transversely on the superior part close to its attachment to the uterus the laceration was nearly through one half of its circumference on the fore part but inclining to the left side the bladder from its connection with the vagina had suffered at the same time being ruptured through the whole of its posterior part at least in proportion to the size of the laceration which had taken place in the vagina we observed that it had extended to the outer surface of the uterus tearing off an angular piece of its peritoneal coat about half an inch in length the uterus was contracted to the usual size it is observed to be in so short a space after delivery its peritoneal coat near the fundus showed an appearance of ucipient mortification the os  was contracted as mr wal  served so that without dii  could not introduce more than two fingers  as the nature of the case was evident we did not proceed further in the dissection but contented ourselves with preserving the parts on making an incision into the uterus it was found in most places to be nearly an inch thick its internal surface appearing in a healthy state and contained a small proportion of the membrana decidua which had been left behind  lacerations of the vagina have been mentioned by authors as sometimes happening from laborious parturition but i do not recollect to have heard or read any account where the child had escaped by such means into the cavity of the abdomen or that they have ever conceived such an accident to be probable i have selected some cases which are related as ruptures of the uterus but which are apparently accidents of this nature thus can be reconciled only by the confusion into which authors have fallen in their divisions of this viscus  anatomists at present are pretty nearly agreed in dividing the uterus into fundus cervix and os internum supposing that the whole of the uterus measures three inches in length they for the most part allow the fundus to occupy the space of one inch and a quarter the cervix to take up one inch and three quarters and the os internum to project within the vagina about a quarter of an inch but when we consider how indeterminate they have heretofore been on this subject we shall not be surprised on examining some of the following cases which are related as ruptures of the cervix to find them lacerations of the vagina from the concurrent testimony of writers it is evident that the vagina has been frequently considered as the collum uteri  columbus in his description of the uterus says colli vel cervicis nomine in utero non corpus illud quod supra descripsimus fed partem illam intelligimus in quam mentula tanquam in vaginam immittitur columb de re anat xi      bartholinus gives the name of collum breve minus to that part which is now called the

bartholini anatom i  0   deventer expressly takes notice of the confusion which attended this division of preceding writers nomen tamen vaginae prefero nomini colli quia saepius autores eodem utentes vaginam ab ipso utero aegre distinguere possunt deventer nov lum obstetr p      case i a case of lacerated vagina from vander weil related by him as a rupture of the uterus  the daughter of jonas pergo had been delivered of four children having very difficult labors with all of them while pregnant with the fifth she suffered a considerable degree of uneasiness her pains were much more urgent when in labor and came on earlier than in her former pregnancies continuing with violence until the third day before delivery when they ceased the midwife could not by any endeavors deliver her the child which was supposed to have been dead some days and which appeared afterward to have been the case from the separation of the cuticle presented with its hands bent behind its neck and the face obliquely upwards toward the pubis  the symptoms becoming more and more violent she being not only faint and feverish with oppression on the praecordia attended with rigors but having vomited up some green faeces which arose he says from the foetus pressing upon the rectum so that they could not find their passage thence cornelius solingius an experienced surgeon was sent for with him to her relief in a short time he delivered her of a dead child as he could not easily bring away the after birth he introduced his hand along the funis but found that it was in contact with the intestines before it came to the placenta which was sound soon after hanging down in three parts within the abdomen out of the uterus from the child having been expelled three days the uterus was so hard and contracted that at first he supposed it to be a scirrhus he separated the placenta from the uterus to which he says it still adhered the cartilage which connected the bones of the pelvis was soft and they were separated from each other nearly the breadth of a finger  the woman died the same day and the body was opened on the next in the presence of vander weil and his brother  the abdomen was much tumified on making an incision into it nothing escaped except a quantity of foetid air and some coagulated blood of a good color which came he says from the cotyledons or mouths of the vessels of the uterus at the time when the placenta was detached from it he passed his hand through the vagina and again found himself in contact with the intestines the uterus receding above the pubis a rupture was observed at the inferior and posterior part just above the os internum at that place where the common membrane from the peritoneum covers and surrounds the uterus as well as the rectum through which rupture the whole of the child except the parts which presented had passed into the cavity of the abdomen this he assigns as the cause why the pains ceased and the mother became easier a few days before delivery stalpaart vander wiel observe rar med cent prim obs lxvi   in the examination of this case i shall confine my remarks to the delivery of the placenta and the appearances upon dissection  after the child was delivered solingius finding that the placenta did not easily follow introduced his hand along the funis with an intention to extract it but found himself in contact with the intestines the placenta being  extra uterum in the cavity of the abdomen the uterus from which he supposes the child to have escaped some days before was contracted and felt so hard  ita ut initio scirrhum crederet in the next sentence he speaks of separating the placenta from the uterus this cannot be reconciled with what he had before related of the placenta being  extra uterum otherwise than by supposing that the placenta while in the abdomen adhered to the external surface of the uterus its adhesion to the surface of the viscera in some other cases having been found to be very considerable douglass case of rupt uterus p    boneti sepulchret anatom lib iii sect      a review of the circumstances which follow the introduction of his hand will elucidate the case when compared with the appearances which were observed on opening the body after death  in the first place no mention is made of any difficulty in introducing the hand through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus which must have been considerable from its contracted state if the attempt had been made  secondly as his hand came immediately in contact with the intestines if the placenta had been within the uterus the intestines must likewise have been within it which does not by any means appear from the narrative  and lastly if his hand had been within the cavity of the uterus how could he have judged of the degree of its contraction so as to have thought it at first to have been a scirrhus  if we consider the case as a partial separation of the vagina from its attachment to the cervix uteri then every one of these objections are surmounted with ease his hand on passing along the funis would have found an easy introduction into the cavity of the abdomen and he would have been in contact with the intestines before his hand arrived at the placenta the uterus would have been found on the anterior part and have felt contracted like a ball so that at first it might have been mistaken for a scirrhus neither of which could have possibly happened if his hand had been within its cavity besides his expression is so clear in respect to its contraction dure admodum compactum atque in se contractum comperit as to leave no room to suppose any thing to have been included within it  we find that on dissection after relating the external appearance of the abdomen and what issued on making an incision into it he passed his hand he says per vulvam and again felt the intestines and what is very material in forming a determination on the nature of the case found the uterus receding above the pubis  recedentemque supra os pubis uterum reperit to use the expression of dr douglas in his late publication it fled before the tips of his fingers  i think it must be evident to every one that the uterus would not have receded before his hand if its attachment to the vagina had remained entire it must have resisted the touch  the place where the rupture is said to have been was at the inferior and posterior part a little above the os internum where the common peritoneal membrane is continued from the rectum to the uterus  now the same peritoneal coat which surrounds the whole of the abdominal viscera in its passage from the rectum to become the external coat of the uterus is inflected over that part of the vagina which is attached to the cervix uteri beginning to form the peritoneal coat of the uterus at the place where the vagina is joined to the cervix a little above the os internum in the same place on the anterior part the vagina was lacerated in the case before related and i think on comparing the different parts of vander wiels relation with each other it is clear that the injury in both cases was nearly similar the only difference being that in one the laceration was in the posterior and in the other in the anterior part of the vagina  case ii a case of lacerated vagina as related by bonetus from leonardus doldius  in the year      a woman of hagenaw in alsace  0 years of age who had been the mother of seven children at the full time but all of them born dead died in labor of the eighth on the third day without being delivered the night before her pains had been violent in the extreme the women who were present made many efforts to deliver her but they were not able to afford her the least help  on opening the body they were very cautious in making their incision into the abdomen that they might have a distinct view of the uterus in situ the muscles were hardly divided when the back of the child was wounded they had no suspicion of what it really was supposing it at first to be the uterus but on continuing the incision they found it to be a full formed foetus with signs of putridity from the separation of the cuticle without the uterus in the cavity of the abdomen it lay with the face to the sacrum and its body extended at full length at first nothing preternatural was observed there being no appearance of contusion wound ulceration or abscess they wondered much at the singularity of the case but this was cleared up when they sound the uterus torn ruptured or rather broken off  the child was still connected by the sunis to the secundines which were retracted upon the left side toward the spleen and adhered so fast that they had some difficulty to separate them the uterus was so contracted that it did not exceed the size of the placenta near the cervix directly under the bladder there was a portion of membrane hanging down about the thickness of the dissecting knife and not exceeding the breadth of half a palm which was a part of the separated uterus uteri abrupti  the rest of the uterus with its proper orifice and the secundines were retracted so that it was totally separated from the cervix or sinus muliebris and all the other parts to which it had before been attached he attributes this accident to the malconformation of the pubis which was too much flattened in oneti sepoiret anatom lib iii sect      the above case requires no comment as i think it is evident that there was a total separation of the uterus from its attachment to the vagina  i remember to have read a case where the same accident happened from the violent efforts of an accoucheur to introduce his hand to deliver  case iii the case of mrs manning as related by dr douglas  we find that the woman who is the subject of this case was in her  th pregnancy low in stature about  0 years of age and of a weak constitution but in general healthy when the doctor was first called to her the membranes had been ruptured eight hours and the pains had continued regular from that time yet though the os tincae was considerably dilated the child did not advance he found her extremely restless complaining of excessive pain in the region of the pubis each return of pain caused her to writhe and twist as if suffering from violent colic very unlike the urging throes of common labor but her pulse was calm and regular nor did she make any particular complaint excepting of the pain about the pubis this being the state of the case there seemed to be no reason to induce him to precipitate the delivery  about nine oclock the same evening the midwife informed him that the patient had had a discharge of blood from the vagina which however did not continue and that the pains had ceased about half an hour after six oclock since which retching with an incessant craving for drink had come on  he now found her face lengthened and bedewed with cold sweat her pulse scarcely to be felt her breathing short and quick with great anxiety but still complaining of no pain excepting about the pubis by examination in the common way he says i could distinguish nothing excepting a round moveable substance which i supposed to be the head of the child but being only able to reach it with my fingers i could not determine with any certainty what it was the woman appeared to be in extremis and my mind was so wholly occupied by her danger as to preclude all reasoning with respect to the cause he determined upon immediate delivery as the only chance of relief there was no difficulty he says in passing my hand and the substance which i had supposed to be the child fled before the tips of my fingers by following it i at last found my hand in a cavity which in no sort resembled that of the uterus i was then forcibly and painfully struck with the nature of the case and on examining all round with caution and gentleness i could with certainty determine that my hand was in the cavity of the abdomen the child being on the fore part on the back part the contracted uterus like an oblong ball and the intestines hanging among any fingers there was no obstruction to the turning and extraction of the child excepting in the passage of the head through the brim of the pelvis the placenta which was likewise in the abdominal cavity had so clung to the intestines that he was again under the necessity of introducing his hand to detach it which was not difficult the uterus seemed he says to have been ruptured transversely on the lower and fore part some distance above where the vagina is connected with it and it was more contracted in its size than i thought possible in the few hours which had elapsed since the accident  after a variety of changes and alarming symptoms arising from peritoneal inflammation the poor woman fortunately recovered and in about six weeks waited upon the doctor at his own house to return thanks when he persuaded her to permit his neighbor dr osborn to examine per vaginam he thought the os tinae somewhat more open externally than it usually is and dr douglas himself fancied he felt rather more fullness than is common about the cervix uteri but they both agreed that there was nothing in the touch so different from what is observed in the natural state as to have excited any idea of previous disease had they not known the complaint with which she had been afflicted  after examining the body of mrs wilkins and ascertaining the nature of the injury i began to consider the above case in a different light from what i did on the first perusal of it the doctor represents it as a case of ruptured uterus i now perceive it to be a case of lacerated vagina  the circumstance which he relates of a round moveable substance which upon introducing his hand he found to be the contracted uterus like an oblong ball was so similar to what mr waller described and which every one of us had an opportunity of observing during the dissection that i have no doubt remaining in my own mind that there could have been any difference between the two cases mr waller and the other gentlemen who were present concur likewise with me in the same opinion  in the preceding pages i have had occasion on a review of the case from vander weil to advert to a similar occurrence when i expressed my doubts how the degree of contraction can be ascertained unless the hand of the accoucheur has been passed on the outside of the uterus i cannot suppose that while the fundus is contracted above the rupture the os internum will remain for several hours nay days dilated and show no disposition to contract the fibers i should apprehend which form its texture will assist its contraction in as great a degree as that of the fundus  dr douglas as well as vander weil found that the uterus receded on introducing his hand is it possible that the uterus should have receded before his hand if its attachment had been entire it must have made some resistance yet we find that when he touched it it fled and upon following it his hand went not into the uterus but into a cavity which in no sort resembled it can it be supposed from this relation so pointedly marked that his fingers ever passed the os internum the uterus must have been fixed if he had entered into its cavity but he says that he was obliged to follow it and at length found his hand within the abdomen the child being on the fore part on the back part the contracted uterus like an oblong ball  case iv a case of lacerated vagina from pouteau related by him as a rupture of the uterus  he was called to the assistance of a woman who had been a considerable time in labor under the care of a midwife she had been seized the day before with a hemorrhage on which the child which had before presented with the head was no longer felt on examination his hand entered at once into a cavity which appeared large on the fore part he felt a round substance of the size but not the solidity of a childs head yet there was not any thing to be felt which could assure him of a child being there the woman died soon after without being further examined on opening the body the child and placenta were found in the cavity of the abdomen entirely out of the uterus which was of the size of a childs head of five years old and was the round body which had been felt per vaginam the rupture was on the posterior and interior part and then about three or four inches long poutean page       when the easy introduction of his hand into a cavity which appeared large at a time when the uterus was contracted to the size of a childs head his perceiving by the touch during his attempt to deliver a round substance which afterward on dissection he found to be the contracted uterus and the state of the rupture being then about three or four inches long when this accident happens in the uterus the size of the rupture is soon diminished rungius relates that the intestines were kept up by his hand until the rupture was sufficiently contracted to prevent their descent dr hamiiton says he had an opportunity of examining how amazingly the rupture was diminished by the contraction of the uterus la motte observes that on dissection the rupture would not admit the tip of his little finger and in other cases we find similar remarks how are we then to account for his finding the rupture to be so very extensive at a time when the uterus was so much contracted  are considered i think that i shall not be too hasty in pronouncing it to have been a separation of the uterus from its posterior attachment to the vagina  as in ruptures of the uterus so in lacerations of the vagina if the head of the child should be advanced so far into the pelvis as to be wedged before a laceration takes place it will remain there and we shall be deprived of one criterion the retrocession of the presenting part to guide us the cessation of the true pains must lead us then to judge of the nature of the case when attended with vomiting and other symptoms as described in the relation of the preceding narratives the following cases is an instance of this kind  case v a case of lacerated vagina where the head was engaged in the pelvis before the accident took place communicated by a friend  a b aged about  0 was taken in labor with her third child on april   th      at four oclock in the morning the waters soon came away on examination the head of the child was found to be low in the pelvis a considerable stricture was observed in the vagina and the sacrum projected rather forward at its apex about five hours after she was first taken in labor she began to complain of pains in her belly which she distinguished from those of labor at three oclock in the afternoon a physician an eminent teacher of midwifery in london was called in at which time from the degree of stricture the part of the head which presented could not be exactly ascertained he ordered her an injection which was given but without any effect on enquiring it appeared that since she began to complain of the pain in her belly the labor pains had ceased a single blade was introduced with ease and some endeavors made to deliver but without success the doctor considering it wrong to struggle against nature or do any thing without the assistance of pains left her giving directions for an enema to be injected and four or six ounces of blood to be taken away  he returned at half past five when very little alteration could be perceived she had no labor pains and the pains continued the same in the abdomen which she now complained was become tender injections were ordered copious and stimulant four were given without any return the forceps were at length applied and used moderately with an intent to bring on a return of true pains but a slight discharge of the glysters was the only effect a little ground was at length gained and by increasing the force for a considerable time she was delivered of a dead child the placenta came away immediately after she made water frequently during the labor and had it drawn off before the use of the forceps she was thirsty and vomited frequently though little in quantity by her cries she did not seem to suffer more pain than is usually felt in her delivery  her pulse were quick after she was in bed she was disposed to vomit and passed a restless night the pain in her belly continued distinct from after pain she lived until the morning of the   th during which time her pulse were generally   0 or more her skin hot she complained of great pain and tenderness of the abdomen she vomited frequently and her urgings to vomit were great  from no local injury being supposed to have happened and from the presence of the lochia and other symptoms the case was considered as truly puerperal and treated as such  on dissection the intestines were found to be inflamed with an exudation of lymph on their surfaces and the gall bladder was large and distended with bile the uterus was contracted to the size of double fist black and beginning to sphacelate the vagina was found to be lacerated at its connection to the cervix uteri anteriorly no vestige of the stricture remaining although in the case which gave rise to these observations the bladder was unfortunately injured yet it does not follow that this must necessarily happen always for in this case we see that a laceration may take place on the anterior part without its being injured and from other cases we are taught that the posterior or lateral parts are as often liable to the accident as the anterior part of the vagina   it is to be observed that the woman had fallen down a day or two before she was taken in labor and that the same gentleman had delivered her two years before with forceps on account of the same stricture  how far the sixth case quoted by dr douglas might be similar to the above i have some doubts but the circumstances attending it render it probable  it appears that the woman had been in labor the best part of the day with very strong pains before the rupture is supposed to have taken place the head was firmly wedged in the pelvis but in attempting to open it suddenly gave way to the force applied  now let us consider for one moment the nature of the case if a rupture had taken place in the uterus as the head was firmly wedged in the pelvis the feet must have been the part protruded whence when i recollect the strong contractile power of the uterus when a part of the child only has escaped through a rupture of the uterus the contraction as related by authors is great hildanus gives a case where the head of a child had passed through a rupture of the uterus which had contracted so strongly round its neck that he says it had no doubt been strangled by it hildani centur i observe       and the length of time intervening between the attempt to open the head and the time when the rupture is supposed to have happened i cannot persuade myself that the child would have escaped so easy into the cavity of the abdomen as he found it did  if the vagina was lacerated it is easy to account for the sudden retrocession of the child it is evident that the uterus being only attached in one place its resistance against the pressure could only be partial the fundus would be inclined and the os internum raised in proportion therefore when the head was pressed back it would find an easy admittance through the laceration into the cavity of the abdomen from the endeavors of the uterus to free itself the body with the placenta would soon follow the rupture being near the cervix is i think some support to what i have advanced i shall likewise endeavor to show in another place that the placenta being in the cavity of the abdomen may be considered as a collateral proof  i am inclined to believe that the whole of the child very seldom escapes from a rupture of the uterus i am however very well convinced that it is always the consequence of a laceration of the vagina unless it should happen to be as firmly wedged in the pelvis as in the cases i have just noticed  on a review of fifteen cases quoted by dr douglas we shall find that the child escaped into the cavity of the abdomen in seven in no vi vii x xi xii xiii and xiv i have already endeavored to show that no vi and xi were lacerations of the vagina and i shall draw some inferences from no xii when i come to speak of the placenta being out of the uterus tending to show a degree of probability of that being of the same nature of no vii we have a very uncertain account as from motives of delicacy it is not particularly entered into no x without doubt must have been a ruptured uterus i think that the two last cannot be considered in point as they were at an early period of gestation and the accidents happened from external violence  in the remaining eight no i ii iii iv v viii ix and xv only part of the child had escaped from the rupture indeed in the two first it does not appear that any part had escaped it is therefore evident that setting aside the two cases from external violence in only one out of thirteen the child escaped wholly from a rupture of the uterus  i am also inclined to believe that the placenta being in the cavity of the abdomen is an occurrence which very seldom happens excepting in those cases where the vagina is lacerated the size of the rupture when it happens in the uterus must be diminished almost immediately after the child has escaped and the contraction of the uterus must be increased by its endeavors to propel the placenta it is therefore almost impossible that the placenta should escape into the abdomen it might indeed sometimes happen if the funis should be much twisted round the childs neck or body in almost every case where we have a certainty that the accident was a rupture of the uterus we find that the placenta remained behind  when a laceration takes place in the vagina the propulsion of the placenta is not different from what happens in common parturition as every contraction of the uterus forces it toward the os internum from whence it passes after the child into the cavity of the abdomen but when there is a rupture in the uterus every contraction must be an impediment to its propulsion by diminishing the size of the aperture through which it must pass to be found among the viscera  in the case of mrs wilkins where we can entertain no doubt of the nature of the accident the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the abdomen in that of mrs manning in those from vander weil bonetus and pouteau and in the sixth case quoted by dr douglas all of which i have endeavored to show were of the same nature the placenta was likewise found among the viscera  there are two more instances among the cases quoted by dr douglas where the same occurrence is said to have happened in no x and xii  the first communicated by dr garthshore is against the opinion i have formed that being as i have before observed evidently a rupture of the uterus in the other from saviard it appears that the child presented favorably with every appearance that the labor would be soon finished yet the pains ceased at once after two days continuance the presenting part receded and only the placenta was to be felt she died undelivered and when the body was opened the child and secundines were in the abdomen among the viscera the feet of the child touching the stomach of the mother the intestines were all fretted and the omentum rotten and stinking but the uterus was of the natural appearance i have not saviards book to refer to but i think from a review of this account i shall be able to draw some inferences in my favor  from the manner in which he expresses himself that the uterus was of its natural appearance we may be led to suppose that no injury had happened to it when we recollect the circumstance that after the presenting part had receded the placenta alone was to be felt i apprehend but a small degree of doubt concerning the nature of the case will remain  after the body was opened the secundines as well as the child were found in the abdomen as the placenta was to be felt on examination after the rupture had taken place how can it be supposed that the rupture was in the uterus the uterus must have been at that time considerably contracted and the aperture so much diminished as to have rendered the escape of the placenta impossible  hence i am clearly of opinion that the placenta being felt on examination after the rupture had taken place and being afterward found in the abdomen is a great proof that the accident was not in the uterus but in the vagina  out of eight cases therefore where the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the abdomen there is the greatest probability to suppose that seven of them were lacerations of the vagina  the difficulty attending delivery when the vagina is lacerated must be very trifling when compared to that which will occur if the accident happens in the uterus in the case of mrs wilkins the only resistance was in bringing down the breech which all the gentlemen present agreed arose from the protuberance of the childs belly projecting over the fundus of the contracted uterus which as the extraction went on was brought lower down and of consequence pressed the breech of the child over the pubis after this was overcome not the least difficulty whatever occurred in the case of mrs manning it does not appear that there was any resistance to the delivery of the breech but we find there was a considerable obstruction in the passage of the head through the pelvis i am somewhat inclined to believe that this might have arisen from the same cause although dr douglas supposes it to have proceeded from the narrowness of the pelvis  in those cases where the uterus has been ruptured the difficulty will be increased or diminished in proportion as more or less of the child has escaped into the cavity of the abdomen  if the rupture should be so extensive as to admit the child to escape entirely out of the uterus from the natural disposition of its fibers the uterus will almost immediately contract and the size of the rupture will become less of consequence in proportion to the degree of contraction which takes place if the rupture should be so small as to admit the protrusion of part of the child only a stricture will be formed upon such part as has escaped which will require a considerable degree of force to overcome as from its endeavors to expel the part which remains the uterus will still continue to contract in performing the caesarean operation m soumain found that the edges of the incision made in the uterus pressed so close upon the foetus that he could hardly get his fingers in to extract it mem de lacad chirurg paris mem xx  hence we may account for the alternate though ineffectual pains which in some cases have been observed to continue for some time after the rupture has taken place and i believe we may be led to form a probable opinion that when this happens some part of the child still remains within the uterus  the hand of the accoucheur when he sits down to deliver must be passed through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus and from thence through the rupture the difficulty attending the passage of the hand will be in proportion to the degree of contraction but unfortunately it is very seldom that the nature of the case is known so early as to induce us to make any attempt to deliver before the uterus is considerably contracted after the resistance from the diminished state of the rupture is overcome and the hand passed into the abdomen the feet in general may be soon found and brought down with some ease but as the operator proceeds and the legs come forward every inch of the child as the extraction takes place will create a fresh resistance from its increasing bulk the irritation which must be given to the uterus by the introduction of the hand will increase its endeavors to contract and make considerable addition to the difficulty caldani of bologna in a letter to haller relates some experiments made on the uterus of a bitch which show the great degree of contraction that takes place even after death on any stimulus being applied to it vide van swietens comment sect        the nearer likewise the rupture happens to the fundus or cervis the greater degree of ease or difficulty will ensue in the first instance the extraction will be made nearly in a direct line in the other and which most commonly happens that part of the child which remains in the abdomen must form an angle with the feet and legs while they are passing through the vagina and the degrees of such angle will be decreased or increased in proportion as the rupture may happen to be either near the cervix or further toward the fundus  very little more exertion will be required than what is obliged to be made use of in a common case where the child is turned when the feet are the only parts that have escaped when the legs have protruded as far as the knee the resistance will be considerably more powerful as in such case the hand must be passed to a greater distance through the rupture in search of the feet but how much more must the difficulty be increased if the aperture should be large enough to admit the child to pass out of the uterus as far as the hips indeed i apprehend this situation to be worse than when the whole of the child has escaped as in that case there may be some hope that the resistance might be overcome and the child extracted by the feet but when the child has escaped as far as the hips such a very considerable distension if not further laceration of the rupture must take place and so great a degree of force must be made use of to overcome the contraction in order to gain sufficient room to bring the feet back as leave little room to hope for success in fact when i reflect on the very great difficulties that must arise when any considerable part of the child has escaped i do not at all wonder that authors have concurred in pronouncing the accident mortal and giving no encouragement for attempting relief except by having recourse to the caesarean operation  in addition to mrs mannings case of which we have had occasion to speak so often eight others are adduced by dr douglas to evince the ease with which delivery may be performed in cases of ruptured uterus no i iv v vi vii viii ix and xv on reading them over with attention i have observed that the situation of the child in most of them was such as to create the smaller degree of resistance according to the opinion i have entertained in respect to the difficulty attending delivery  in the first which was related to heister by rungius it does not appear that the child or any part of it had ever been in the cavity of the abdomen indeed dr douglas is of the same opinion himself as he says the recovery of the patients no i and ii may have been in a great measure owing to the viscera having sustained little or no injury as there is no reason to suppose that the child in either case had been in the cavity of the abdomen vide observat on extr case of rupt uter p     this may give us some idea of the prospect we have of recovery when a rupture takes place but cannot be brought to show the ease with which delivery may be performed when the whole or part of the child has escaped from the uterus  in no iv which is taken from la motte observation     the feet were the only parts out of the uterus and the rupture was at the fundus whence the extraction was not attended with much difficulty for two reasons the endeavors made use of were in a direct line in the first instance and in the second the feet being the only parts that had escaped the hand of the accoucheur was introduced until it came to the knees so as to bring them down and disengage the feet after which no more difficulty would arise than what happens in a common case of turning  in no v likewise from la motte observation     it appears that the child had escaped out of the uterus as far as the hips or even further part of the body being in the cavity of the abdomen the child was turned he says and extracted with considerable ease en moins dun miserere as he expresses it himself i cannot think with dr douglas that la mottes observations are related with such plainness and candor as to claim our most perfect confidence in this instance we have a case the most difficult that can possibly happen and yet the delivery was performed with the greatest ease imaginable i really am of opinion that the relation is not founded in fact i apprehend that he has either magnified the proportion of the child which was out of the uterus or that he has concealed the difficulty he must have met with in case such a considerable part of the child had been in the abdomen  i have advanced some reasons in a former part of these observations when speaking of the head of the child being wedged in the pelvis at the time when a laceration happens tending to show that no vi was a laceration of the vagina  we have a very defective account of no vii as from motives of delicacy to the gentleman who attended the patient dr douglas does not think himself at liberty to enter more particularly into it  in no viii from peu the time elapsed between the accident and the delivery is not related but i am inclined to believe that it was done very soon after from the apparent facility with which it was accomplished there appears likewise some deficiency in the contractile power of the uterus by the excessive hemorrhage that followed we find however that he delivered with great caution to avoid doing further injury to the uterus this seems to intimate some degree of resistance although none is mentioned  dr douglas observes that the great contractile power of the uterus is favorable to the process of healing by bringing the divided parts more into contact but he says the presence of any considerable extraneous substance even in the abdomen seems in some degree to counteract this power of contraction dogls case of ruptured uterus p     if the uterus after the expulsion of its contents does not contract as in common parturition we must expect a considerable flooding in the above case we are told that it was excessive in the cases of mrs wilkins and the others which i have related as lacerations of the vagina the hemorrhage was not very great that a considerable hemorrhage will follow however from a laceration of the vagina as well as from a rupture of the uterus we have the authority of veslingius bis enim notavi cum uteri vagina secundum latus dextrum esset disrupta quamvis foetus extinctus integre cum secundis educeretur subsequente ex laceratis hypogastricis vasis enormi sanguinis profluvio matrem paulo post fato pariter cessisse  j veslingii observe et epist     and the uterus was found contracted to the usual size it would have been in the same space of time if no extraneous body had been in the cavity of the abdomen  in no ix from steidele it appears that the head had escaped from the rupture he brought down the feet with ease but found some difficulty in extracing the rest of the foetus this diffaculty must evidently have arisen from the stricture formed by the edges of the rupture round the childs neck whence i think it cannot be considered as much support to evince the ease with which delivery is performed any more than the last case where the patient expired while the accoucheur was endeavoring to bring the head through the pelvis  lacerations of the vagina i have before observed have been taken notice of by authors yet it does not appear that they have had any idea of the childs escaping by such means into the cavity of the abdomen if the case which gave rise to these observations in which the nature of the accident could not be mistaken and my reasoning on the different cases i have adduced are allowed to have any weight i think i may venture to draw the following conclusions  first that the whole of the child escapes into the cavity of the abdomen much oftener from a laceration of the vagina than from a rupture of the uterus  secondly that from the little difficulty with which delivery is accomplished in lacerations of the vagina there is a greater prospect of recovery in such accidents than when the uterus is the seat of the injury  it is evident that the gloomy idea of inevitable death has not only been the means of checking such endeavors as might have been sometimes successful but that it has likewise been often the means of preventing us from knowing the real nature of the injury i hope practitioners in future will from the fortunate event of the case of mrs manning related by dr douglas and the new light thrown on the subject by the case i have related of mrs wilkins entertain a more favorable opinion of the success likely to attend their endeavors in a situation where nothing but immediate delivery can afford the least prospect of recovery  when first i made my private remarks on mrs wilkinss case i did not intend to enter further into the subject than to draw the case up sair and send it to some periodical publication as worthy the attention of the medical world but the similarity between it and that of mrs manning was so striking that the more i considered it the more reasons i saw to induce me to publish it in the present form  the nature of the subjct has obliged me to enter very fully into the merits of dr douglass case that he should be liable to cr in forming an opinion on the nature of the accident is not to be wondered at when we consider how silent authors have been upon it and how seldom accidents of this nature occur i have not the honor of being known to him but i am confident from the liberality of his sentiments as a gentleman that he will not consider the liberty i have taken as personal or in any other light than as a discharge of the duty every man in the profession owes to the world it has a claim upon us to elucidate any occult part of the science and every man is bound by the laws of humanity to comply with it whenever an opportunity offers exempla rara non reticenda etiam causa incognita ita enim scitu digna infinita
