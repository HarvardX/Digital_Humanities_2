well and knowing him know me left solely heir to all his lands and goods which i have bettered rather than decreased and i have thrust myself into the world happily to wive and thrive as best i may my business asks haste old signior and every day i cannot come to woo let specialties be therefore drawn between us that covnants may be kept on either hand  baptista yes when the special thing is well obtained my daughters love for that is all in all  petruchio why that is nothing for i tell you father i am as peremptory as she proudminded and where two raging fires meet together they do consume the thing that feeds their fury though little fire grows great with little wind yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all so i to her and so she yields to me for i am rough and woo not like a babe  grumio nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an old trot with never a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal   baptista as i have showed you sir the coarser side now let me tell you she is young and beauteous brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman her only fault and that is fault enough s that she is intolerably froward f that you can away with she is yours  grumio i pray you sir let him see her while the humor lasts of my word an she knew him as well as i do she would think scolding would do little good upon him she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so why that is nothing an he begin once she will find her match i will tell you what sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat  you know him not sir   baptista and will you woo her sir  petruchio why came i hither but to that intent think you a little din can daunt my ears have i not in my time heard lions roar have i not heard the sea puffed up with winds have i not heard great ordnance in the field and heavens artillery thunder in the skies have i not in a pitched battle heard loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clangue and do you tell me of a womans tongue that gives not half so great a blow to hear as will a chestnut in a farmers fire tush tush scare boys with bugs  baptista then you are the man the man for cathrine and her father too that shall she know and know my mind at once i will portion her above her gentler sister newmarried to hortensio and if with scurril taunt and squeamish pride she make a mouth and will not taste her fortune i will turn her sorth to seek it in the world nor henceforth shall she know her fathers doors  petruchio say thou me so then as your daughter signior is rich enough to be petruchios wife be she as cursed as socrates zantippe she moves me not a whit  were she as rough as are the swelling adriatic seas i come to wive it wealthily in padua if wealthily then happily in padua  baptista well may thou woo and happy be thy speed but be thou armed for some unhappy words  petruchio aye to the proof as mountains are for winds that shake not though they blow perpetually catharine and the musicmaster make a noise within  musicmaster within help help  catharine within out of the house you scraping fool  petruchio what noise is that  baptista oh nothing this is nothing  my daughter

do look pale  baptista what will my daughter prove a good musician  musicmaster i think she will sooner prove a soldier iron may hold with her but never lutes  baptista why then thou can not break her to the lute  musicmaster why no for she has broke the lute to me i did but tell her she mistook her frets and bowed her hand to teach her fingering when with a most impatient devilish spirit frets call you them quoth she i will fret your fools cap and with that word she struck me on the head and through the instrument my pate made way and there i stood amazed for awhile as on a pillory looking through the lute while she did call me rascalfidler and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms as she had studied to misuse me so  petruchio now by the world it is a lusty wench i love her ten times more than ever i did oh how i long to have a grapple with her  musicmaster i would not make another trial with her to purchase padua for what is past i am paid sufficiently if at your leisure you think my broken fortunes head and lute deserve some reparation you know where tenquire for me and so good gentlemen i am your much disordered humble servant exit baptista not yet moved petruchio

sword taken out of the town armory with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipd with an old mothy saddle the stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampasse insected with the farcy full of windgalls sped with spavins raied with the yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots waid in the back and shoulder shotten near legged before and with a half checked bit and a headstall of sheepleather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling has been often burst and now repaired with knots one girt six times piecd and a womans crupper of velure which has two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there piecd with packthread   baptista who comes with him  biondello o sir his laquey for all the world caparisond like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot hose on the other gartered with a red and blue list

speed you to his country house to prepare for his reception and if he finds not things as he expects em according to the directions that he gave you you know he says what follows this message he

you brother pedro when the priest should ask if catharine should be his wife aye by gogswounds quoth he and swore so loud that all amazed the priest let fall his book and as he stooped again to take it up this madbraind bridegroom took him such a cuff that down fell priest and book and book and priest now take them up quoth he if any list  pedro what said the wench when he rose up again  biondello trembled and shook for why he stamped and swore as if the vicar went to cozen him but after many ceremonies done he calls for wine a health quoth he as if had been aboard carousing to his mates after a storm quafft of the muscadel and threw the sops all in the sextons face having no other cause but that his beard grew thin and hungerly and seemed to ask his sops as he was drinking this done he took the bride about the neck and kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack that at the parting all the church echoed and i seeing this came thence for very shame and after me i know the

fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor it blots thy beauty as frosts bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable  petruchio why well said kate  catharine a woman moved is like a fountain troubled muddy illseeming thick berest of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will dain to sip or touch a drop of it  bianca sister be quiet   petruchio nay learn you that lesson  on on i say  catharine thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labor both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold while thou lie warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt  baptista now fair befall thee son petruchio the battles won and thou can keep the field  petruchio oh fear me not   baptista then my now gentle cathrine go home with me along and i will add another dowry to another daughter for thou art changed as thou had never been  petruchio my fortune is sufficient here is my wealth kiss me my kate and since thou art become so prudent kind and dutiful a wife petruchio here shall doff the lordly husband an honest mask which i throw off with pleasure far hence all rudeness wilfulness and noise and be our future lives one gentle stream of mutual love compliance and regard  catharine nay then i am all unworthy of thy love and look with blushes on my former self  petruchio good kate no more  this is beyond my hopes  goes forward with catharine in his hand such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman owes to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sower and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord how shameful it is when women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway where bound to love to honor and obey  finis
