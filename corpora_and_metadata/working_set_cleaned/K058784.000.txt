reasons for not replying to mr waltons full answer in a letter to p t p  by the author of the minute philosopher  ex fumo lucem dublin printed by m rhames for r gunne bookseller in capelstreet mdccxxxv  reasons for not replying to mr waltons full answer etc i there are some men that can neither give nor take an answer but writing merely for the sake of writing multiply words to no purpose there are also certain careless writers that in defiance of common sense publish such things as though they are not ashamed to utter yet other men may well be ashamed to answer whether there be any thing in mr waltons method of vindicating fluxions that might justify my taking no further notice of him on the abovementioned considerations i leave you and every other reader to judge but those sir are not the reasons i shall assign for not replying to mr waltons full answer the true reason is that he seems at bottom a facetious man who under the color of an opponent writes on my side of the question and really believes no more than i do of sir isaac newtons doctrine about fluxions which he exposes contradicts and confutes with great skill and humor under the masque of a grave vindication  ii at first i considered him in another light as one who had good reason for keeping to the beaten track who had been used to dictate who had terms of art at will but was indeed at small trouble about putting them together and perfectly easy about his readers understanding them it must be owned in an age of so much ludicrous humor it is not every one can at first sight discern a writers real design but be a mans assertions ever so strong in favor of a doctrine yet if his reasonings are directly levelled against it whatever question there may be about the matter in dispute there can be none about the intention of the writer should a person so knowing and discreet as mr walton thwart and contradict sir isaac newton under pretense of defending his fluxions and should he at every turn say such uncouth things of these same fluxions and place them in such odd lights as must set all men in their wits against them could i hope for a better second in this cause or could there remain any doubt of his being a disguised freethinker in mathematics who defended fluxions just as a certain freethinker in religion did the rights of the christian church  iii mr walton indeed after his free manner calls my analyst a libel vindication p   but this ingenious gentleman well knows a bad vindication is the bitterest libel had you a mind sir to betray and ridicule any cause under the notion of vindicating it would you not think it the right way to be very strong and dogmatical in the affirmative and very weak and puzzled in the argumentative parts of your performance to utter contradictions and paradoxes without remorse and to be at no pains about reconciling or explaining them and with great good humor to be at perpetual variance with yourself and the author you pretend to vindicate how successfully mr walton has practiced these arts and how much to the honor of the great client he would seem to take under his protection i shall particularly examine throughout every article of his full answer  iv first then says mr walton i am to be asked whether i can conceive velocity without motion or motion without extension or extension without magnitude to which he answers in positive terms that he can conceive velocity and motion in a point  p   and to make out this he undertakes to demonstrate that if a thing be moved by an agent operating continually with the same force the velocity will not be the same in any two different points of the described space but that it must vary upon the least change of space now admitting thus much to be demonstrated yet i am still at a loss to perceive how mr waltons conclusion will follow to wit that i am greatly mistaken in imagining there can be no motion no velocity in a point of space  p  0 pray sir consider his reasoning the same velocity cannot be in two points of space therefore velocity can be in a point of space would it not be just as good reasoning to say the same man cannot be in two nutshels therefore a man can be in a nutshel again velocity must vary upon the least change of space therefore there may be velocity without space make sense of this if you can what have these consequences to do with their premises who but mr walton could have inferred them or how could even he have inferred them had it not been in jest  v suppose the center of a falling body to describe a line divide the time of its fall into equal parts for instance into minutes the spaces described in those equal parts of time will be unequal that is from whatsoever points of the described line you measure a minutes descent you will still find it a different space this is true but how or why from this plain truth a man should infer that motion can be conceived in a point is to me as obscure as any the most obscure mysteries that occur in this profound author let the reader make the best of it for my part i can as easily conceive mr walton should walk without stirring as i can his idea of motion without space after all the question was not whether motion could be proved to exist in a point but only whether it could be conceived in a point for as to the proof of things impossible some men have a way of proving that may equally prove any thing but i much question whether any reader of common sense will undertake to conceive what this pleasant man at inference undertakes to prove  vi if mr walton really meant to defend the author of the fluxionary method would he not have done it in a way consistent with this illustrious authors own principles let us now see what may be sir isaacs notion about this matter he distinguishes two sorts of motion absolute and relative the former he defines to be a translation from absolute place to absolute place the latter from one relative place to another see schol def viii philos not princip math mr waltons is plainly neither of these sorts of motion but some third kind which what it is i am at a loss to comprehend but i can clearly comprehend that if we admit motion without space then sir isaac newtons account of it must be wrong for place by which he defines motion is according to him a part of space and if so then this notable defender has cut out new work for himself to defend and explain but about this if i mistake not he will be very easy for as i said before he seems at bottom a back friend to that great man which opinion you will see further confirmed in the sequel  vii i shall no more ask mr walton to explain any thing for i can honestly say the more he explains the more i am puzzled but i will ask his readers to explain by what art a man may conceive motion without space and supposing this to be done in the second place to explain how it consists with sir isaac newtons account of motion is it not evident that mr walton has deserted from his old master and been at some pains to expose him while he defends one part of his principles by overturning another let any reader tell me what mr walton means by motion or if he can guess what this third kind is which is neither absolute nor relative which exists in a point which may be conceived without space this learned professor says i have no clear conception of the principles of motion  p    and in another place  p   he says i might have conceived velocity in a point if i had understood and considered the nature of motion i believe i am not alone in not understanding his principles for myself i freely confess the case to be desperate i neither understand them nor have any hopes of being ever able to understand them  viii being now satisfied that mr waltons aim is not to clear up or defend sir isaacs principles but rather to contradict and expose them you will not i suppose think it strange if instead of putting questions to this intrepid answerer who is never at a loss how often soever his readers may i entreat you or any other man of plain sense to read the following passage cited from the thirty first section of the analyst and then try to apply mr waltons answer to it whereby you will clearly perceive what a vein of raillery that gentleman is master of velocity necessarily implies both time and space and cannot be conceived without them and if the velocities of nascent and evanescent quantities i e abstracted from time and space may not be comprehended how can we comprehend and demonstrate their proportions or consider their rations primae and ultimae for to consider the proportion or ratio of things implies that such things have magnitude that such their magnitudes may be measured and their relations to each other known but as there is no measure of velocity except time and space the proportion of velocities being only compounded of the direct proportion of the spaces and the reciprocal proportion of the times does it not follow that to talk of investigating obtaining and considering the proportions of velocities exclusively of time and space is to talk unintelligibly apply now as i said mr waltons full answer and you will soon find how fully you are enlightened about the nature of fluxions  ix in the following article of mr waltons full answer he says diverse curious things which being derived from this same principle that motion may be conceived in a point are altogether as incomprehensible as the origin from whence they flow it is obvious and natural to suppose ab and ba see not phil princip math l   lem   to be rectangles produced from finite lines multiplied by increments mr walton indeed supposes that when the increments vanish or become nothing the velocities remain which being multiplied by finite lines produce those rectangles  p    but admitting the velocities to remain yet how can any one conceive a rectangular surface to be produced from a line multiplied by velocity otherwise than by supposing such line multiplied by a line or increment which shall be exponent of or proportional to such velocity you may try to conceive it otherwise i must own i cannot is not the increment of a rectangle it self a rectangle must not then ab and ba be rectangles and must not the coefficients or sides of rectangles be lines consequently are not b and a lines or which is the same thing increments of lines these increments may indeed be considered as proportional to and exponents of velocity but exclusive of such exponents to talk of rectangles under lines and velocities is i conceive to talk unintelligibly and yet this is what mr walton does when he makes b and a in the rectangles ab and ba to denote mere velocities  x as to the question whether nothing be not the product of nothing multiplied by something mr walton is pleased to answer in the affirmative and nevertheless when ab is nothing that is when a and b are nothing he denies that ab  ba is nothing this is one of these many inconsistencies which i leave the reader to reconcile but says mr walton the sides of the given rectangle still remain which two sides according to him must form the increment of the flowing rectangle but in this he directly contradicts sir isaac newton who asserts that ab  ba and not a  b is the increment of the rectangle ab and indeed how is it possible a line should be the increment of a surface laterum incrementis totis a et b generatur rectanguli incrementum ab  ba are the words of sir isaac see not phil princip math l   lem    which words seem utterly inconsistent with mr waltons doctrine but no wonder that gentleman should not agree with sir isaac since he cannot agree even with himself but contradicts what he says elsewhere as the reader may see even before he gets to the end of that same section wherein he has told us that the gnomon and the sum of the two rectangles are turned into those two sides by a retroverted motion  p    and    which proposition if you or any other person shall try to make sense of you may possibly be convinced that this profound author is as much at variance with common sense as he is with himself and sir isaac newton  xi mr walton in the ninth page of his vindication in order to explain the nature of fluxions says that to obtain the last ratio of synchronal increments the magnitude of those increments must be infinitely diminished notwithstanding which in the twenty third page of his full answer he charge me as greatly mistaken in supposing that he explained the doctrine of fluxions by the ratio of magnitudes infinitely diminished it is an easy matter for any author to write so as to betray his readers into mistakes about his meaning but then it is not easy to conceive what right he has to upbraid them with such their mistakes if i have mistaken his sense let any one judge if he did not fairly lead me into the mistake when a man puzzleth his reader says and unsaith uses ambiguous terms and obscure terms and puts them together in so perverse a manner that it is odds you can make out no sense at all or if any a wrong sense pray who is in fault but the writer himself let any one consider mr waltons own words and then say whether i am not justified in making this remark  xii in the twentieth page of his full answer mr walton tells us that fluxions are measured by the first or last proportions of isochronal increments generated or destroyed by motion a little after he says these ratios subsist when isochronal increments have no magnitude now i would fain know whether the isochronal increments themselves subsist when they have no magnitude whether by isochronal increments we are not to understand increments generated in equal times whether there can be an increment where there is no increase or increase where there is no magnitude whether if magnitudes are not generated in those equal times what else is generated therein or what else is it that mr walton calls isochronal i ask the reader these questions i dare not ask mr walton for as i hinted before the subject grows still more obscure in proportion as this able writer attempts to illustrate it  xiii we are told  p    that the first or last ratio of the isochronal spaces has a real existence forasmuch as it is equal to the ratio of the two motions of two points which motions subsisting when the isochronal spaces are nothing preserve the existence of the first or last ratio of these spaces or keep it from being a ratio of nothings in order to assist your understanding it must not be omitted that the said two points are supposed to exist at the same time in one point and to be moved different ways without stirring from that point mr walton has the conscience to call this riddle a full and clear answer to make sense of which you must suppose it one of his ironies in the next and last article of his performance you still find him proceed in the same vein of raillery upon fluxions  xiv it will be allowed that who ever seriously undertook to explain the second third and fourth fluxions of sir isaac newton would have done it in a way agreeable to that great mans own doctrine what sir isaacs precise notion is i will not petend to say and yet i will venture to say it is something that cannot be explained by the three dimensions of a cube i frankly own i do not understand sir isaacs doctrine so far as to frame a positive idea of his fluxions i have nevertheless a negative conception thereof so far as to see that mr walton is in jest or if in earnest that he understands it no more than i do  xv sir isaac tells us that he considers indeterminate quantities as flowing or in other words as increasing or decreasing by a perpetual motion which quantities he denotes by the latter letters of the alphabet and their fluxions or celerities of increasing by the same letters pointed over head and the fluxions of fluxions or second fluxions i e the mutations more or less swift of the first celerities by the same letters pointed with double points and the mutations of those mutations of the first mutations or fluxions or celerities of increasing which he calls fluxions of fluxions of fluxions or third fluxions by three points the fourth fluxions by four points the fifth by five and so on see his treatise de quadratura curvarum  sir isaac you see speaks of quantity in general and in the analyst the doctrine is exemplified and the case is put in lines now in lines where there is only one dimension how are we enabled to conceive second third or fourth fluxions by conceiving the generation of three dimensions in a cube let any one but read what sir isaac newton or what i have said and then apply what mr walton has written about the three dimensions of a cube and see whether the difficulties are solved or the doctrine made one whit the clearer by this explication  xvi that you may the better judge of the merit of this part of mr waltons performance i shall beg leave to set down a passage or two from the analyst as it is impossible to conceive velocity without time or space without either finite length or finite duration it must seem above the power of man to comprehend even the first fluxions and if the first are incomprehensible what shall we say of the second and third fluxions etc he who can conceive the beginning of a beginning or the end of an end somewhat before the first or after the last may perhaps be sharpsighted enough to conceive these things but most men i believe will find it impossible to understand them in any sense whatsoever one would think that men could not speak too exactly on so nice a subject and yet we may often observe that the exponents of fluxions or notes representing fluxions are confounded with the fluxions themselves is not this the case when just after the fluxions of flowing quantities were said to be celerities of their increasing and the second fluxions to be the mutations of the first fluxions or celerities we are told that  represents a series of quantities whereof each subsequent quantity is the fluxion of the preceding and each foregoing is a fluent quantity having the following one for it is fluxion diverse series of quantities and expressions geometrical and algebraical may be easily conceived in lines in surfaces in species to be continued without end or limit but it will not be found so easy to conceive a series either of mere velocities or of mere nascent increments distinct therefrom and corresponding thereunto analyst sect          compare what is here said with mr waltons genesis of a cube and you will then clearly see how far this answerer is from explaining the nature of second third and fourth fluxions and how justly i might repay that gentleman in kind and tell him in his own language that all his skill is vain and impertinent vind p     xvii but it does not become me to find fault with this learned professor who at bottom militates on my side and in this very section makes it his business directly to overthrow sir isaac newtons doctrine for he says in plain terms that there can be no fourth fluxion of a cube  p    that is there can be no second fluxion of a line and a fortiori no third fourth fifth etc insomuch that with one single dash of his pen mr walton destroys to the great relief of the learned world an indefinite rank of fluxions of different orders that might have reached from pole to pole i had distinctly pointed out the difficulties in several parts both of my analyst and defense and i leave you to judge whether he explains or even attempts to explain one of them instead thereof he tells us of the true dimension of a cube generated by motion whence he takes occasion as has been observed to explode sir isaacs own doctrine which is utterly inconsistent with mr waltons and can you now doubt the real design of this egregious vindicator  xviii before ever sir isaac newton thought of his fluxions every body knew there were three dimensions in a cube and that a solid might be generated by the motion of a surface a surface by the motion of a line and a line by the motion of a point and this in effect is all we know from mr waltons explication as for his dwelling so minutely on the genesis of the solid parts of a cube a thing so foreign from the purpose the only rational account i can give of it is that mr walton by puzzling the imagination of his vulgar readers hoped the better to disguise his betraying the doctrine of his great client which to a discerning eye he manifestly gives up and instead thereof humourously substitutes what all the world knew before sir isaac was born to wit the three dimensions of a cube and the genesis thereof by motion  xix upon the whole i appeal to you and every intelligent reader whether this thing which walton is pleased ironically to call a full answer does not carry throughout a fly insinuation that the profound science of fluxions cannot be maintained but by the help of most unintelligible paradoxes and inconsistencies so far indeed as affirmations go he shows himself an able support of sir isaac newton but then in his reasonings he drops that great man upon the most important points to wit his doctrine of motion and his doctrine of fluxions not regarding how far the demonstration of his famous principia is interested therein to convince you still more and more of the truth hereof do but reflect a little on mr waltons conduct can you think it probable that so learned and clearheaded a writer would have laid down such a direct repugnancy to common sense as his idea of motion in a point for the ground work of his explanation had it been his real intention to explain or can you suppose he would have been absolutely silent on so many points urged home both in the analyst and defense which it concerned a vindicator of sir isaac not to have overlooked can you imagine that if he meant seriously to defend the doctrine of fluxions he would have contented himself with barely asserting that sir isaac newton in the introduction to his quadrature of curves in the second lemma of the second book and in the scholium to the first section of the first book of his principles of philosophy has delivered his doctrine of fluxions in so clear and distinct a manner without the least inconsistency in terms or arguments that one would have thought it impossible for any person not to have understood him  p  0  xx is it possible i say that mr walton could in earnest hope we should take his bare word as so much more credible that sir isaacs and not rather have endeavored to answer the questions and reconcile the difficulties set forth in my defense of freethinking for instance in sect xxxvi wherein i entreat my antagonist to explain whether sir isaacs momentum be a finite quantity or an infinitesimal or a mere limit adding if you say a finite quantity be pleased to reconcile this with what he says in the scholium of the second lemma of the first section of the first book of his principles cave intelligas quantitates magnitudine determinatas sed cogita semper diminuendas sine limite if you say an infinitesimal reconcile this with what is said in the introduction to his quadratures volui ostendere quod in methodo fluxionum non opus sit figuras infinite parvas in geometriam introducere if you should say it is a mere limit be pleased to reconcile this with what we find in the first case of the second lemma in the second book of his principles ubi de lateribus a and b deerant momentorum dimidia etc where the moments are supposed to be divided i shall scarce think it worth my while to bestow a serious thought on any writer who shall pretend to maintain sir isaacs doctrine and yet leave this passage without a reply and the reader i believe will think with me that in answer to difficulties distinctly proposed and insisted on to offer nothing but a magisterial assertion is a mere grimace of one who made merry with fluxions under the notion of defending them and he will be further confirmed in this way of thinking when he observes that mr walton has not said one syllable in reply to those several sections of my defense which i had particularly referred to as containing a full answer to his vindication but it is no wonder if with sir isaacs doctrine he should drop also his own arguments in favor thereof  xxi i have been at the pains once for all to write this short comment on mr walton as the only way i could think of for making him intelligible which will also serve as a key to his future writings on this subject and i was the rather inclined to take this trouble because it seems to me there is no part of learning that wants to be cleared up more than this same doctrine of fluxions which has hitherto walked about in a mist to the stupefaction of the literati of the present age to conclude i accept this professors recantation nor am at all displeased at the ingenious method he takes to disguise it some zealous fluxionist may perhaps answer him  finis books printed for richard gunne bookseller in capelstreet l s d letters from a persian in england to his friend at
