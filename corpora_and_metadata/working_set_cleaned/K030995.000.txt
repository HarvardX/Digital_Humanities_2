the read their page    l    dele not an appendix to the representation etc since the publication of my book on the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerating slavery in england several unforeseen circumstances have obliged me to consider that subject more strictly in order to obviate the insinuations of some interested persons who still endeavor to inculcate and maintain even in this island the ungenerous west indian notions concerning property in slaves  upon these dangerous princip several violent outrages have lately been committed for the recovery of such pretended property and several negroes have been knocked down and kidnapped by ruffians hired for that purpose and have been hurried on ship board in order to be transported to the west indies in open contempt of the english laws and of the habeas corpus act in particular which denounces heavy penalties against those who attempt to transport any person whatever from this kingdom against their will for i have shown in my former treatise in pages  0 to    that negroes and all other aliens are the kings subjects when resiant in this kingdom and that they are entitled to the protection of the english laws in general and of the habeas corpus act in particular the same arguments are further enforced in pages     to      in pages     to     of the same book will be found a full answer to such arguments as had then been offered concerning any right which the master may have acquired to the perpetual service of a man and in pages     and     it is i hope demonstrated that the service of a slave cannot justly be compared to the service of an apprentice and that a contract cannot be implied in such a case as some learned men have insinuated  in the fourth and last part of the said tract the doctrines of villenage are shown to be obsolete so that the least claim of perpetual service cannot be justified thereby  these references to my former work are inserted here partly to avoid a recapitulation of these necessary points and partly that those who have any concern at present in such matters may thereby be enabled to consider and examine these several heads without the trouble of reading the whole book which is not so compendious as the author could wish it having been wrote at several different periods as occasion offered and new arguments were opposed during the time that an action which was shamefully prolonged depended against the author and one of his brothers for having accidentally not officiously assisted a poor negro servant who was kidnapped and confined in the poultry compter without a warrant and there sold to a west india planter to be transported to jamaica  it has already been proved in the places before referred to that no right whatever can be acquired to the perpetual service of a man without a contract and that such a contract cannot be implied unless the free consent of both parties is implied likewise and clearly proved nevertheless as some sordid and tenacious contenders for this kind of imaginary property are still so inconsiderate as to risque all the penalties of a praemunire besides heavy fines by venturing to seize and carry away by force their quondam slaves i am willing for the present to admit their plea of private property merely that i may examine the weight of it and balance it with the negroes property in his own person which in a land of justice does equally demand some share of our consideration  the authors and abettors of the scandalous and inhuman outrages of which i complain cannot possibly ground their defense on any other point whatsoever than this single plea of private property and the necessary obligation of the courts of justice to secure to every man his own now if a negro man or any other human being whatever is considered as property in this country he falls under the head of chattels and must necessarily so far i mean as the masters right ought to be considered be ranked under that denomination  now a chattel is res estimabilis a thing to be valued a thing merely of a pecuniary consideration and the slaveholder accordingly rates his supposed property in a man at a base price not more upon an average than the value of a good horse viz  0 l  0 l or  0 l to the disgrace of human nature whereas on the other hand the negro though considered as a chattel with respect to the masters claim yet being himself also a man has certainly a superior right and title to his own person a claim of natural property in himself which is inestimable far above all pecuniary consideration for with respect to his side of the question the human body is above all price corpus humanum non recipit aestimationem principia legis and aequitati p    surely his liberty to him is inestimable  at least the english law presumes that it is so libertas est res inestimabilis jenk cent    now let the idea of the chattel even at the highest price it will bear be weighed and compared with the subject of the last mentioned maxim and let justice hold the scale  shall we doubt whether the estimable claim or the inestimable claim is to be preferred  the law regards the person above his possessions  life and liberty most  freehold and inheritance above chattels etc ibid p     so that chattels we find are but of a very inferior consideration being ranked only in the third degree  law favors life liberty and dower and cannot therefore give the preference to the masters mere mercenary claim of property without a manifest contradiction to itself  and the law abhors falsehood variance contrariety etc  lex angliae non patitur absurdum   cook     lex rejicit pugnantia incongrua jenk cent   0          it is true indeed that the law in this case may seem to suffer or permit a wrong by the masters losing his supposed right and property but if we consider that the admitting such a property would be a want of mercy in the law nay even an act of cruelty which the law abhors toward those persons who have a superior because a natural interest in the determination of this question it must appear to demonstration that the law does no wrong when it rejects the lesser claim of estimable property in favor of that natural interest which is inestimable and therefore howsoever the imaginary proprietor may think himself aggrieved yet the law is vindicated herein when we consider that every claim of property is absolutely unjust in itself and must necessarily be set aside through the mercy of the law if it interferes or is inconsistent with that natural and equitable claim to personal security which the law of this kingdom has always favored for the law of england is a law of mercy lex angliae est lex misericordiae   inst     so that each slaveholder must still be obliged to allow that the law even in this unavoidable decision against himself does injury to no man  lex nemini operatur iniquum  nemini facit injuriam  let the slaveholder remember also that his being thus deprived of his imaginary property cannot be considered otherwise let him make the most of it than merely as a private loss whereas if such an unnatural right be admitted without due consideration of the superior personal right of the negro a worse vassalage than the ancient villenage the ancient villenage was long since extinguished through the virtue and continual opposition of the kings courts in favor of the common law which i have elsewhere shown so that such another unjust tyranny cannot possibly be admitted without an apparent violation of the common law would in time be introduced into this free christian country by which the public would be materially injured as well in honor as in morals and national safety therefore the law will rather endure a particular mischief as the loss of private property than a general inconvenience lex citius tollerare vult privatum damnum quam publicum malum co lit      thus stands the common law with respect to the point in question and it is not i apprehend in the least altered by statute law so that unless the advocates for slavery can prove that it is altered we may safely conclude with the following maxim that whatever was at common law ana is not taken away by statute remains still co lit      i flatter myself that no gentleman of the law will attempt to contradict or set aside the established maxims which are here quoted because such a behavior would necessarily draw upon them that just censure and contempt which the learned author christopher seyniarmayne or st german who died in      of the doctor and student expresses in his viiith see the english translation printed in      page    chapter against all lawyers without exception to dignity that presume to contradict approved maxims  the fourth ground of the law of england says he stands in diverse principles that be called in the law maxims the which have been always taken for law semper habita et tenta sunt pro lege in this realm so that it is not lawful for any that is learned to deny them for every one of those maxims is sufficient authority to himself  thus far the translator but we may gather from the words of the excellent author himself see the latin edition in   mo printed in   0  page     that men who deny these maxims are no longer worthy to be talked with  for he adds in tanto quod cum negantibus ea viz maxima non est ulterius arguendum quartum fundamentum legis angliae stat in diversis principiis quae a peritis legis angliae maxima vocantur quae semper habita et tenta sunt pro lege in hoc regno angliae quibus non est licitum alicui legis perito contradicere quia unumquodque maximorum illorum est sibi ipsi fides in tanto quod cum negantibus ea non est ulterius arguendum   a more modern but not less respectable author has furnished us with a maxim nearly to the same effect viz those that forego or set aside the law of the land deservedly incur from thence a perpetual stain of infamy  legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt sir ed cook iiid inst      thus the plea of private property in the persons of men must necessarily fall to the ground when it is measured by the maxims of the common law  i have not designedly done any injustice to this plea and though i may perhaps have treated my subject injudiciously and not according to method yet i defy the most interested advocate for slavery to give more real weight or value to such kind of property than what i have already stated if at the same time the learned judge blackstones arguments concerning the three origins of slavery be duly considered  i have quoted these arguments at length in my former tract from page     to     but shall nevertheless repeat them here and pledge them as unanswerable by the most able casuist or even by the learned author himself were he to undertake it but this i speak only comparatively referring to his great abilities not his will for though i have been obliged to guard against some doubtful expressions in other part of his works see my former tract pages     to     yet i have too good an opinion of that worthy gentleman to conceive that he will ever entertain any real inclination for so ungenerous a task  the three origins of the right of slavery says he assigned by justinian are all of them built upon false foundations as first slavery is held to arise jure gentium from a state of captivity in war whence slaves are called mancipia quasi manu capti the conqueror say the civilians had a right to the life of his captive and having spared that has a right to deal with him as he pleases but it is untrue position when taken generally that by the law of nature or nations a man may kill his enemy he has only a right to kill him in particular cases in cases of absolute necessity for selfdefence and it is plain this absolute necessity did not subsist since the victor did not actually kill him but made him prisoner war is itself justifiable only on principles of selfpreservation and therefore it gives no other right over prisoners but merely to disable them from doing harm to us by confining their persons much less can it give a right to kill torture abuse plunder or even to enslave an enemy when the war is over since therefore the right of making slaves by captivity depends on a supposed right of slaughter that foundation failing the consequence drawn from it must fail likewise but secondly it is said that slavery may begin jure civili when one man sells himself to another this if only meant of contracts to serve or work for another is very just but when applied to strict slavery in the sense of the laws of old rome or modern barbary is also impossible every sale implies a price a quid pro quo an equivalent given to the seller in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer but what equivalent can be given for life and liberty both of which in absolute slavery are held to be in the masters disposal  his property also the very price he seems to receive devolves ipso facto to his master the instant he becomes his slave in this case therefore the buyer gives nothing and the seller receives nothing of what validity then can a sale be which destroys the very principles upon which all sales are founded  lastly we are told that besides these two ways by which slaves fiunt or are acquired they may also be hereditary servi najcunter the children of acquired slaves are jure naturae by a negative kind of birthright slaves also but this being built on the two former rights must fall together with them if neither captivity nor the sale of ones self can by the law of nature and reason reduce the parent to slavery much less can they reduce the offspring upon these principles the law of england abhors and will not endure the existence of slavery within this nation so that when an attempt was made to introduce it by statute   edward vi c   which ordained that all idle vagabonds should be made slaves and fed upon bread water or small drink and refuse meat should wear a ring of iron round their necks arms or legs and should be compelled by beating chaining or otherwise to perform the work assigned them were it never so vile the spirit of the nation could not brook this condition even in the most abandoned rogues and therefore this statute was repealed in two years afterward coms   vol p     thus it is clear that there can be no claim of right to the perpetual service of a man which is not originally founded either in rapine theft or notorious injustice for it must be obvious to every person who is not blinded by the desire of gain says the author of a short account of the slave trade etc which i caused to be reprinted in      p    that the right by which these men hold the negroes in bondage is no other than what is derived from those who stole them who having no other title but that which robbers have over their prey could not convey any better to the purchaser and that therefore to continue to hold them in bondage for wordly advantage by no other right than that which those guilty men give them is consenting to and partaking of their guilt  therefore when a notorious outrage and breach of the peace is committed under the pretense of any such groundless claim of service the magistrate who neglects to relieve the person oppressed and to punish the offenders is certainly a partaker of their guilt and no upright and conscientious judge who does not set up his own will above the laws of the land can possibly entertain any doubt in his mind about the punishment of such offenders for when the laws of the land and especially the habeas corpus act are expressly and clearly on one side of the question without the least exception whatever concerning any difference or distinction of persons and when the only plea on the other side of the question is absolutely without foundation either in natural equity or the established law and customs of this country what room can there be for doubt and how would a judge be able to justify an arrest of judgment in such a case  every judge is or ought to be sworn that he will minister justice indifferently or without respect of persons to all men  se justitiam ministraturum indifferenter omnibus hominibus fortescue de laudibus leg angliae chap    and therefore if the laws and established customs of the land with respect to the present question make no distinction of persons whether bond or free white or black neither can a judge without risquing the guilt of perjury  i have proved in page     of my former tract that the laws of england in the late reign were esteemed obnoxious to any involuntary bondage without a just cause and to all private jurisdictions whatsoever so that an extension of the influence see the act of  0 geo ii entitled an act for taking away and abolishing the heretable jurisdictions in that part of great britain called scotland etc benefit and protection of these laws was considered as a relief to our fellow subjects in scotland from all private oppression i mean the late pernicious vassalage of scotland the extinction of which has happily produced the present flourishing state of arts trade and manufactories amongst our brethren in that part of the island  but as the claim of private property in the persons of men is the very root and foundation of the worst kind of vassalage i must observe that if any judge should hereafter venture to suspend the execution of the english laws in consideration of any such kind of pretensions whatever he might be said to stab the constitutional freedom of two great and ancient kingdoms at one blow for how should our fellow subjects at the other end of the island be able to trust in the parliamentary promise of the influence benefit and protection of the kings laws to be extended as far as scotland if the said laws were really liable to be rendered ineffectual even in england by a mere groundless doubt of one single judge  a doubt is certainly a very insufficient excuse for an arrest of judgment in any case whatever unless strong and probable grounds are alleged to justify it but a groundless doubt upon the present question would be more particularly criminal because it would probably tend to the introduction of the diabolical see a note in my former tract page     where this hard epithet is proved tyranny and injustice of our west indian colonies whereby human nature is vilifyed and degraded to the rank and level of brute beasts for not only the grossest oppression of our fellow man but even murder ibid page    and    is there tolerated and marriage excluded ibid page     as i have shown in the notes to my former work ibid page    to    the last of these pages    is now earnestly recommended by the author to the serious perusal of all persons who have any influence in government if they sincerely wish prosperity to england   whatever tends to the same point viz the degradation of human nature and the introduction of that consummate wickedness which must of course prevail wherever slavery is tolerated does certainly promote the work and service of the grand enemy of mankind and consequently ought to be esteemed highly offensive to almighty god  some persons may perhaps allege in vindication of the supposed doubt above mentioned that the legislature has at different times given encouragement to the african slave trade however detestable and pernicious to mankind it may be esteemed and that the same ought to be accounted an acknowledgment that property in slaves is in some degree lawful  such arguments and insinuations i have frequently heard but let the advocates for slavery make the most of them they can yet shall they not be able to avail themselves of any such strained consequential doctrines for suppose that the legislature should unwarily happen to do wrong in any particular point whatsoever and that any one of their subjects in a judicial character should instead of giving them warning of the evil be ready to go before them in it and should even show himself prone to carry the mischief to a much higher pitch than the legislature ever conceived or intended by endeavoring to render ineffectually one of their most solemn acts relating in some respect to the same point which we will suppose to have remained unrepealed and in full force and which might therefore have been used as a just and honest expedient to save the honor of the legislature and correct the inadvertent evil such a neglect and contempt of a positive and established statute added to a disregard of natural as well as national justice ought to be esteemed as a sufficient reason for condemning such a man as a most undutiful subject and dangerous politician  but to carry the argument still further let us suppose what i trust will never come to pass that even the legislature itself should become so miserably degenerate as to repeal or annul the habeas corpus act and adopt instead of it the most horrid and diabolical of the west indian laws yet even in this case the natural unlawfulness and wickedness of such principles as those laws contain would still remain for no legislature on earth which is the supreme power in every civil society can alter the nature of things or make that to be lawful which is contrary to the law of god the supreme legislator and governor of the world mischief may be framed and established by a law but if it be it is mischief still as much so as it was before it was established though its being so may make men insensible of their guilt or bold and fearless in the perpetration of it for too many among christians are contrary to christs exhortation more influenced by the fear of man than by the fear of god  it is really a serious subject and i own it raises a serious concern in my mind that such barbarity should be suffered in christian nations it is enough to make a mans heart ach unless he has not lost all love and regard to his kind to think that so many thousands of the human race should be sacrificed every year to that greedy voracious god mammon short account of the slave trade p      the number of negro slaves bought in one year only viz      on the coast of africa from cape blanco to rio longo amounted to  0   00 persons according to a particular state of that trade inserted in the gazetteer of the  th of july      these miserable creatures it is said were bought by barter for european and indian goods chiefly at    l sterling each  now it is dreadful to consider what multitudes of men must have been killed merely in the attempt to take so many wretched captives for sale and again what multitudes out of so large a number would die as usual in their passage to the west indies and america either of grief and despair or by being inhumanly stifled in the holds of ships besides the large proportion nearly one half that would die of the seasoning as it is called after their arrival in the plantations and lastly that all the remainder of this vast multitude of  0   00 miserable human beings will probably be worn out by hard service and oppression in the space of about    years or less according to the average rate of some calculations that have been published these considerations i say must needs inspire us with indignation and horror even though the evil at present is at a considerable distance from us but if the advocates for the unnatural and unlawful claims against which i contend should receive such encouragement as to confirm their pretensions the same must inevitably introduce by degrees a toleration of the west india slavery with all its direful consequences into this kingdom which added to the manifold corruptions and depravties into which this kingdom has already unhappily fallen will certainly cause our measure of iniquity to overflow and in all probability draw down upon us some dreadful and speedy national calamity the irish at the first council of armagh in the reign of k henry the ii were persuaded and they had but too much cause for it that the miseries with which their island was then afflicted were the effect of gods wrath for their having tolerated slavery amongst them see rapin   vol p      besides that severe judgment which is already but too apparent amongst us i mean that deplorable hardness of heart and abandoned spirit of injustice which has rendered the
