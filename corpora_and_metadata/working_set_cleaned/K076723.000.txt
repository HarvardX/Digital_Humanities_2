highness george prince of wales sir the author of these fables flatters himself that the principles of a steadfast loyalty imbided in his earliest days from the example and instruction of a father who had the honor to serve your royal highnesss illustrious ancestors near fifty years in a military station principles ripened and established by a conviction that the public welfare depends on the increase and prosperity of the august house of brunswic may claim some indulgence for the many imperfections of a composition which he thus presumes to lay at your royal highnesss feet  if a laudable desire to sow the seeds of moral truth if an ardent zeal for our civil and religious liberties if a sincere attachment to his majestys person whose mild government preserves to us those invaluable blessings whose paternal care and bright example afford us the happy prospect of their being transmitted to latest posterity  if motives such as these shall appear to have warmed the authors breast

fell out that meeting at olympic rout for goddesses have had their day to be as modern ladies gay two females mostly known by name one virtue called  the other fame disputed who should lead or follow into the presence of apollo the matter after verbal fight was brought before the god of light when fame remarked for nimble tongue addressing first complained of wrong shall i declaimed the winged fair who boast such eyes so fine an air with almost every beauty graced be thus in competition placed with such a formal homely creature without one fashionable feature shall i to whom the great resort whom monarchs have been proud to court provoking fate midst wars alarms to gain possession of my charms precedence yield to one so mean amongst the great so seldom seen whom rustic cots can better please than dear enchanting palaces the very thought is filled with shame and judgment gives in right of fame she paused  apollo then desired such answer as the cause required which virtue thus with modest grace an easy shape and cherub face declared before the court in brief thence justly claiming fit relief this girlish female god of day to knaves and fools a frequent prey of high connections boasts in vain light phantoms of her idle brain greatness you will own  without my care a baseless castle in the air and rural cots where i resort much nobler than a vicious court it is true she posts the world around and fills it with a mighty sound over mankind rules in various spheres and leads them captive by the ears yet what of this when often she flies to propagate the grossest lies and wounds in blackest guilts defense the cause of spotless innocence here then let ill timed difference end on worth and justice i depend the judge who heard with much respect his sentence passed to this effect spoke all his thoughts without disguise the impartial camden of the skies virtue no doubt may justly claim precedence from contending fame though monumental falsehoods pass with fools because engraved on brass though villains of gigantic size in marble statues vainly rise though titles coronets and state like gewgaws deck the unworthy great though venal authors gild a name which sacred truth would brand with shame a cheated peoples loud huzzas with all the farce of earthly praise by virtue unsupported fail and vanish like the passing gale then madam fame deceitful beauty it is fit that you confess your duty for though exalted by a throne you cannot long exist alone virtue observe i recommend as kindest parent truest friend beneath whose just and gentle sway you will live till time itself decay i look into the womb of time and view a yet unnoticd clime by neptunes azure flood enclosed where harrassd freedom safe reposed shall gain you with a gracious smile to live as friends in britains isle to beam your luster round her throne and mark her monarch all your own fable ii the nile and the sea life a dependant chain appears with links to join its several spheres show judging reason when you will one placed on high there is higher still till strained progression mounts the sky and melts in vast infinity pride like a prism such tints reveals as wisdoms naked eye conceals how idly vain then mortal man whose fleeting life is but a span though raised on fortunes boldest wing a rich a brave a happy king who thinks with selfsufficient spirit all centers in his boundless merit who void of gratitude and sense disclaims parental providence whence all above and all below wealth happiness and courage flow the king of rivers sevnmouth nile which yearly floods the neighboring soil which loads with grain the teeming earth and gives a thousand harvests birth  once like a human coxcomb thought his power alone those blessings wrought  what is he cried the thirsty sea in competition set with me my springs my streams support its tide whose mighty gulf must unsupplied turn to a wild and barren shore the boasting watery world no more to scatter blessings round i reign and fertilize a vast domain which wisely annual homage pays in fit returns of grateful praise while yonder congregated flood does none or very little good  and yet its haughty billows rise as if to brave the unheeding skies what stoic here could check a smile to hear the sea compared with nile the selfsufficient river spoke in sounds like clouds of thunder broke till even its crocodiles began to vie with huge leviathan and thought they must in reason be of greater size and quality old ocean heard and though disdain had best repaid a speech so vain he chose with condescension mild thus to rebuke his eldest child restrain presuming brook thy pride though thou and all thy springs were dried thy petty tribute hardly missed in glory i should still exist who gives the suns exhaling beams the moisture to supply thy streams who gives the fleecy clouds their rain to sprinkle thirsty earth again thou but returnst what i have lent to form a fruitful continent raised in thy own opinion high thou think not that beyond the sky there dwells a power a general source who gave the elements their course who gave the lower world its birth of water framing it and earth who fixed to each the proper bound and mantled them with ether round who marked the glorious sun his way who bid it shine and give the day who spangled over with gems of light the mild cerulean robe of night who gave in his omnipotence to beasts their strength to man his sense who clothed the birds with plumed grace who fishes formed a scaly race who fixed the seasons varying round with different fruits and emblems crowned the eyeenlivning pregnant spring with vegetation on its wing the bridegroom summer decked with flowers and blooming natures strongest powers autumn in golden honors clad the peasants humble hopes to glad hoar winter with its chilly train of earthrefreshing frosts and rain it is providence which all bestows no atom selfexistent grows twas providence created me and hence was formed a source for thee it is providence that gives again thy borrowed waters to the main it is providence suspends them high condensed in clouds twixt earth and sky it is providence with boundless powers that melts them to propitious showers from providence all blessings flow which animated beings know it is providence which reigns through all which guides and shields this earthly ball content with thy exalted state learn wisdom  and be truly great  remember thy majestic flood the eternal gave for others good not for thyself alone designed but to enrich and bless mankind  perform on natures stage thy part well satisfied with what thou art wisely support thy rank and spirit by aiming at superior merit nor vainly seeking higher style in claiming more be less than nile like human fools who with such care build baseless castles in the air which rise at magic follys call and with the breath of reason fall thus venerable ocean said  and sunk beneath the waves his head fable iii the just lion a fox impelled by hungers cries had made a lamb his sacrifice when just as every thing was fit to revel on his dainty bit a lordly panther passing by beheld it with voracious eye and being nobly born of course the foxs dinner seized by force with this remark  though peasants starve peers as they please should always carve reynard through fear must needs obey so licked his chaps and slunk away yet still though not in body strong his feeling heart would bear no wrong to leos court with speed he flew there standing in the monarchs view stated at full the oppressive case with simple truth and piteous face concluding thus  my prince i know will most impartial justice show wherefore to his decision i submit my life and property the weak the nameless and the poor where virtue reigns must be secure the lion heard with honest wonder and cried if i permit such plunder the monarchy of beasts will then degenerate into that of men  but other views shall guide my sway and every rank our laws obey summon lord panther  straight he came  and boldly answered to his name confessed the injured foxs charge in all its several points at large yet confidently seemed to think that vulgar creatures meat and drink should to indulge his want or whim just as he chose belong to him you know my liege continues he i am one of noble progeny  who if occasion urged me could alliance prove to royal blood  shall paltry reynard dare complain nor meet as sure he ought disdain titles and rank are my defense but what can save his insolence for my own part i am content his crime should be his punishment then let him gracious liege i pray this once go unchastisd away the lion worthy of his place with sparkling eye and awful grace spoke thus and bade his court attend  this panther once my valued friend convicted thus of proud oppression by evidence and selfconfession however he thinks the action light i banish from my heart and sight shall noble birth from justice save shall titles serve to screen a knave shall subjects be afraid to speak and shall the strong devour the weak the chain of prudent order broke authority becomes a joke and thus applied however sublime preeminence becomes a crime it never shall my friends be said when dust entombs this royal head to stain our name in future years that leo sheltered lawless peers  subjects observe what i decide to shame and sting dishonest pride this panther on the fox shall wait six tedious months in servile state and when occasion gives the charge still watch for prey or hunt at large but never presume to taste a bit till reynard graciously thinks fit selfknowledge thus a friend may be and blunt the edge of tyranny may teach him that the lordly part is seated in a noble heart which rather would itself endure some pangs of want than rob the poor if ever to shame our laws and sense i meet again such violence justice shall doom severer fate to punish the licentious great nor will i mark me subjects own ought noble but the good alone fable iv the mountain and cloud a mountain which might justly vie with atlas to support the sky for ages had with boundless pride oerlookd the plains on either side and thought from his prodigious birth he ought to rule their humbler earth though graced with corn and fruit and flocks in contrast to his barren rocks on which instead of ought that grows hung tempests dark and endless snows one sullen care  his follys doom  still rankled in his flinty womb that while the radiant source of day beamed over the vales with kindly ray an envious cloud eclipsing light wrapped his majestic head in night impatient of supposed disgrace and fond to show his hideous face like some amongst the human kind to all their grossest failings blind who selfsufficiently reveal what prudence wisely would conceal he thundered forth his plaint aloud against the dark impending cloud how long foul vapor will thou dare to shroud my brows and taint my air shall i who raging tempests sconr though on the wings of lightning borne shall i whose strength can never fail though even a deluge should assail be thus obscured  vile cloud away and give me to the eye of day stung with this insolent address the cloud replied  i must confess gigantic neighbor what you speak declares that you though great are weak what worth or beauty can thou show that is equal to the plains below what laboring oxen till thy soil what harvests pay the peasants toil what fruits what herbage grace thy sides what useful river over thee glides what forests nod upon thy brows never ruffled by industrious ploughs why steril mass of rugged stone with skin of thriftless moss oergrown should thou proclaim thy giant size as if from thence desert could rise or make objections to my shade suspended over thy towering head without reflecting it is the fate attending on superior state to have or me or some such other perhaps a tempestbreeding brother around by way of caution glide to check the swell of monstrous pride while humble and contented plains an emblem of their village swains with justice claim in being less a larger share of happiness in their obscure unenvied station than in thy cloud topt exaltation which spite of all the strength you boast in sudden ruin may be lost thus spoke the cloud as if inspired and with a passing gale retired when straight a subterraneous sound like distant thunder bellowed round the mountain felt convulsive pain and trembling shook through every vein fable v the eagle and jay an eagle whom we soon might prove descended from the bird of jove had we or time or cause to trace the progress of his royal race diminished fame and weakened sway by placing friendship on a jay a bird who like dissembling man played well the game of  cat in pan not one of all the feathered kind so nicely knew the monarchs mind not one with such persuasive art could learn the fecrets of his heart nor gain with much superior sense and loyalty such confidence this prattling favorite often slew in quest of news which false or true he whispered to his masters ear whose greatest weakness was to hear the jay to serve each selfish end appeared a very sanguine friend would often lament that subject hearts were pregnant with destructive arts that nothing could but watchful eyes prevent deep laid conspiracies declared he knew that many birds were noted for disloyal words who therefore ought to feel disgrace in banishment from court and place urging his prince with rigrous claws to put in force tyrannic laws with mischiefworking hints like these he roused such groundless jealousies that every night the eagles dreams were haunted with seditious schemes his tortured fancy often viewed by different deaths his life pursued his scepter broke his throne oerturnd his race destroyed and palace burned till made by perturbation sour he felt each pain of thorny power and bowed beneath the cumbrous weight of friendless solitary state with one sole blessing that the jay paid faithful homage to his sway his truest friends perceived him shy suspicion gloomd his piercing eye a speechless cold and distant state made loyalty and love abate disorder crept throughout his realm while he sat trembling at the helm yet none presumed to ask the reason lest freedom might be construed treason at length the monarch wearied out began to entertain some doubt whether his friend might not improve on trifles through excessive love as apprehension often has made a giant of an empty shade possessed of this incog he flew and wisely took a general view some plaints he heard but soon descried they sprung from his suspicious pride and met upon the whole content wherever his pleasing course he bent to find himself through every wood on every plain and every flood though censured in his regal part still monarch of each subject heart at length as with returning night he homeward winged his rapid flight skirting along a lonely wood near which an ancient castle stood from its declining mossclad wall by trembling age prepared to fall a well known voice assailed his ear he curvd his course and drawing near perceived the jay in this address the deep designing knave confess you think me loyal as i pay my courtly visits every day but penetration never will deem us leveehunters what we seem and on my word sir falcon know my friendship is but outward show were i the honest truth to own i wish to see you mount the throne our eagles but a silly fowl not two degrees above an owl without the least pretense on earth to royalty except his birth then let us find some specious cause suppose our liberties and laws to seize his crown and in his stead to place it on your abler head i have a tongue both quick and loud let me harangue the gaping crowd with promises  sure bait for fools  who serve as politicians tools i will bring about a revolution to mend our shattered constitution with honest rage the eagle warmed and with deathdealing talons armed pouncd unperceived upon the jay and snatched his felonlife away this sacrifice to justice made the injured eagle wisely said i find at length this prudent truth that choice of friends to age or youth is from the cottage to the court a matter of the last import from me let future monarchs learn by their own senses to discern nor exercise unsafe command by knowledge gained at second hand fable vi the farmer and sparrows a farmer saw with much regret some sparrows in his field of wheat and taking up a plundered ear exclaimed in rage what havocks here for this have i manured the soil and tilled it with laborious toil these feathered epicures  a curse to each industrious farmers purse  i will try without the least delay to kill to maim or fright away the thing no sooner said than done he brought with double charge his gun then plundrers cried resign your breath to leaden messengers of death and as his thoughtless rage inspired amongst the corn and birds he fired six victims fell  a joyful sight  he ran and seized them with delight aha he cries at length you are caught your dainties have been dearly bought from hence your brother thieves may know justice is sure though sometimes slow one sparrow who had yet some breath replied you triumph in our death we lie before your vengeful eyes no doubt a pleasing sacrifice yet foolish mortal see and own the unthought mischief you have done much more though rashly meant for good than twenty times our number could besides surviving friends will more revenging us invade your store what does your reason then avail if only weighed in passions scale we lose a doubtful life it is true but certain good is lost to you the farmer looked when lo he saw full fourscore yards of earless straw for such a tract the shot had made he saw with grief and sighing said i am a fool i own the name i doubly feel the loss and shame and find the man by passion wrought who turns to action sudden thought instead of profit or content will find occasion to repent then why should anger reason fetter reflection would have taught me better fable vii the knight errant in former times much worse they were than those which give us vital air for always be it understood the present are both great and good there lived so says our tale a wight whom scruples made an errant knight a more romantic headed ass than quixote charles or hudibras who in his moral feelings nice resolved to quell the monster vice a greater hydra ten degrees than that destroyed by hercules armed as he fancied capapie with reason and morality stronger though light to take the field than ajax boasted sevnfold shield a court he sought as proper soil to exercise his pious toil sincerity devoid of state conducted to the palace gate and seeking entrance gave her name corruption asked from whom she came which told he shook his hoary head and with a shrug important said admittance there could only be for those of highest quality yet stretching forth his itching palm with features and expression calm he hinted favor to the knight if softened by a perquisite our hero thinking once let in his work of glory might begin straight let some golden logic drop that cerberus might have a sop but ah in vain at every door corruption met him as before though proteus like in various guise to cheat his unsuspecting eyes for none of all the courtly tribe would move he found without a bribe wearied at length and what is worse encumbered with an empty purse he cried was virtue never here one answered is he friend a peer or commoner of large estate we know him not unless he is great discretion strove in vain to assuage our hero filled with fireeyd rage who fiercely swift destruction vowed to vice and all her train aloud his furious speech a lordly wag immediately pronounced scan mag and threatened with a special warrant the person of our poor knight errant who rather dreading such a case resolved to fly the ticklish place from court he sought a ladys route and conquest hoped beyond a doubt he stood and saw with painful eye the spotted witches circling fly and said more devastation springs from four ill painted pasteboard kings than ever was spread over public good by any tyrant since the flood at length a countess  nothing new  secured a pam to save her loo which gave occasion to the knight to speak at large against the bite when one and all the gamesters said he merited a broken head but said through grace and he might thank it they would only toss him in a blanket not satisfied he sought the city and said on change twas wondrous pity that mankind for each other made should try to overreach in trade that merchandise could only be a source of sordid usury that moral feelings were discarded and darling gain alone regarded that as the sage socrates  by virtue awed called markets once the seat of fraud so still he added to their shame they merited the hateful name a broker of the hebrew nation a knave by nature and vocation who knew his own defective heart assumed the irritative part declared that man who could defame and taint the traders spotless name that others might be kept in awe deserved the sharpest lash of law thus having sounded an alarm each conscious knave began to warm a hum of mischievous intent ran through the sons of cent per cent till once again our knight defeated before an host of foes retreated and wiser grown than heretofore resolved to combat vice no more the moral hence we hope is plain that mankind are so blind or vain so whirled by whim by passions tossed all but the name of virtues lost that good examples more prevailing than all enthusiastic railing and that the mans an errant knight who strives with general vice to fight fable viii the beau and butterfly thus speaks an adage somewhat old truth is not to be always told what eye but struck with outward show admires the pretty thing a beau which both by art and nature made is the sport of sense the toy of ladies a mortal of this tiney mold in clothes of silk adorned with gold and dressed in every point of sight to give the world of taste delight prepared to enter his sedan a birthday picture of a man cried out in vain soliloquy was ever creature formed like me by art or natures nicest care made more complete and debonnair i see myself with perfect joy of human kind the je ne scai quoy in every thing i rival france in fashion wit and sprightly dance so charming are my shape and parts i am formed for captivating hearts the proudest toast when in the vein i take at once by coup de main mort de ma vie it is magic all i look and vanquished women fall one of the race of butterflies an insect far more nice than wise who from his sunny couch of glass had listened to the two legged ass with intermeddling zeal replied unequaled folly  matchless pride shall thou a patchwork creature claim more lovely shape or greater name than one of us assert thy right stand naked in my critic sight to parent earth at once resign the produce of her golden mine give to the worm her silken store the dimond to golcondas shore nor let the many teeth you want be plundered from the elephant let native locks adorn thy head nor glow thy cheeks with borrowed red give to the ostrich back his plume nor rob the cat of her perfume here to the beaver yield at once his fur which crowns thy empty sconce in short appear through every part no more nor less than what thou art then little better than an ape will show thy metamorphosd shape while butterflies to death retain the beauties they from nature gain you will say perhaps our sojourn here is less by half than half a year that churlish winter surely brings destruction to our painted wings i grant the truth  now answer me  can beaus outlive adversity will milliners and tailors join to make a foppish beggar fine it is certain no  of glitter made  you surely vanish in the shade compared then who will dare deny a beau is less than butterfly fable ix socrates and the beau a grecian smart or buck or beau greece had her coxcombs too we know would needs his puny wit engage with socrates the moral sage this dupe to fashions flimzy rules like some we know  existing fools  religion deemed and even sense against politeness an offense  despised as vain all learned knowledge which youth derives from school or college  and said time only flew to waste unless with pleasure winged and taste full of himself with eager pace he sought the sages dwelling place which found like all the forward kind he left his complaisance behind pushed boldly in when lo his fight was struck with unforeseen delight to catch the philosophic ass contemplating a looking glass friend socrates the witling cries good morning  shall i trust these eyes  can gravity like yours enjoy so insignificant a toy i thought a mirror only fit where beauty holds the place of wit a plaything for the young and gay to fool their vacant hours away yet hold  perhaps unusual graces the eye of contemplation traces i will take myself a nicer view and give so great a man his due he cocked his glass  for every beau used such two thousand years ago then cried  ye gods how fine a creature what harmony of limb and feature what eagle eyes how grave a beard was ought more perfect ever reared though in the clouds a comedy of aristophanes you have made me gay it is now but simple truth to say for elegance of shape and clothes youre foremost of athenian beaus untouched with idle hasty passion by this ironic fool of fashion the man can bear all rubs in life who bore like him a scolding wife the moralist looked up and smiled then said i must instruct you child  you stare  nay think me not absurd  youre but a child upon my word know sir that years exceeding twenty nor partial fortune shedding plenty that titles person dress nor gait can dignify with mans estate beyond all honors show or pelf is both to know and rule thyself this mirror can if well applied assisting reason checking pride much more instructive lessons teach than folly and her train can reach  deign sprightly sir to take a view twas chiefly made for such as you  soon as it struck sir foplings eyes distended features showed surprise and well to own a truth they might at such a mortifying sight for lo the glass beyond a doubt had turned the reptile inside out he saw with pain his brainless scull of gewgaws and of fashions full and found that vice in every part had putrified his wretched heart says socrates good friend what now why sits amazement on your brow had you but strivn to deck your mind nor all your care to dress confined a fairer prospect then had been in such a kind reflector seen time yet is yours  employ it better  nor be to common sense a debtor let kind reflection justly tell the happy art of living well an art if i can ought discern fine gentlemen want much to learn the beau abashed retired in haste both disappointed and disgraced fable x the swallow and pike it is common amongst human kind all errors but our own to find nay often we lay severest blame when guilty of the very same what magic power can dim our sight or make us look through partial light selfapprobation thee i call the dear delusive source of all the hypocrite with sainted face will still hypocrisy disgrace lifts up in prayer his hands and eyes unblushing to the insulted skies while earthincumberd thought remains fast bound below in worldly chains yet calls devotion impious art which flows not pure and from the heart the gamester cries that shame should fix her brand upon dishonest tricks to slip a card or cog a die he calls the blackest infamy yet stake with him he is nothing loath wheneer he can to practice both the envious man affects surprise to hear of grudging hearts or eyes though all he sees another gain infects his worthless mind with pain narcissas husband six weeks dead even widow like she chose to wed amelia heard cried fie for shame and in a fortnight did the same liberia whose abandoned life with modesty holds constant strife exclaims what shame do those deserve who cannot keep a just reserve thus censure like a shuttlecock is bandied round the human flock and always takes its boldest wing from those who best deserve its sting the setting sun with eastward beams now lightly sparkled over the streams when eager in pursuit of food an hungry swallow skimd the flood myriads of flies must death endure to gorge the feathered epicure who rather sated with his prey turned serious work to wanton play and in his gambols needs must try how near the water he could fly so near the rash adventrer went to that precarious element that from his rushencircled bed a greedy pike raised up his head and darting as the swallow passed caught his unthinking victim fast a pinion broke then let him float within the compass of his throat while thousands and ten thousand flies buzzed loud thanksgiving to the skies that such an hungry monsters doom should be to find a living tomb the wounded bird made his defense by thus pretending innocence  what have i done good lordly pike to merit thus your dread dislike it was beneath your rank to follow a poor and inoffensive swallow so mild and tender in his nature as never to hurt a mortal creature audacious wretch the pike replied of guilt convicted soon as tried how dares thy coward cunning try to shelter life with sophistry why over this river did thou skim was it for profit slave or whim did thou not dare before these eyes to gorge innumerable flies insects whose right to life though small equals the greatest of us all whose tender fibers crushed retain as quick and deep a sense of pain besides my darling fish must be deprived of these unfit for me like me thou have no other right but greater strength and appetite if i am a murderer in thy view the flies may call thee murderer too yet still we only follow man to prey on what and whom we can thus pleading natures general law he gave the morsel to his maw fable xi the birth day the morn was come the brilliant morn on which fame said my lord was born the courtly sun  who more polite contributed unusual light  the vegetable world was seen exhibiting more vivid green the feathered songsters tuned their throats to louder and more jocund notes all nature smiled and looked more gay to honor the auspicious day nor could she reason must confess do for a titled mortal less  whom twentyone indulgent years had ripened for the house of peers at such an era custom pays a world of compliments and praise mere phantoms of external show which from the lip of interest flow for let the selfsame wondrous man so worshipped by a servile clan be stripped of titles and estate he is then no longer good nor great the birth day levee now were come and marshalled in the drawing room a medly of most curious creatures as different in designs as features here fawning priests with looks demure in hopes to get a better cure appeared to grace the friendly crowd and very low  for livings bowed  on to other side the sons of law their reverence make with distant awe no counsel sure would ever grudge a scrape or two  to be a judge even thy disciples mars beset the youthful rising coronet but where is he the race can shun when thou preferment bidst him run thy magic spur can quicken all to circle round this earthly ball to combat dangers cares and strife nay some to hazard fame with life amongst the rest one suitor came a stranger scarcely known by name who acting on a different plan declared himself the honest man this rustic blade approached the peer  i have reached he said my ninetieth year three score of which young lord have i been tenant to your family  then let me first with kindness prove your patronage and noble love though plain my coat my heart i trust has ever been in action just i boldly ask what these conceal and hope to win what they would steal your favor  not for selfish end  but more to show myself your friend i ask not wealth for common sense has made me rich in competence i ask not titles they must shame my humble parts and humble name but ask a boon which you may grant nor for another suit or want age bows my body to the grave remaining time i wish to save thus hasting off this stage of strife will you bestow some years of life the youthful peer whose heart was good and full as noble as his blood in sentiments as rank sublime perhaps the carlisle of his time  replied i understand thee not  what power have i to change thy lot of life or death  yet what is mine i promise freely shall be thine i have heard thy worth and dare afford to bind it with my solemn word oh noble youth returned the fire may heaven thy virtuous mind inspire each worthy deed of thine will be a year of added life to me  thus i may ask without a crime to lengthen out with joy my time his lordship heard with smiling face then rushed into a kind embrace and cried good father thy request shall live for ever in this breast and far as mortal frailty reaches i will practice what thy wisdom teaches nor will i specious show regard but worth in honest men reward and keep my favors there confined where virtues ornament the mind he said  the levee shrunk away  like night before the rising day fable xii the lion and fox a lion full of youthful blood who ruled at large a spacious wood whom flatterers had often told no spear could pierce no toil could hold like some amongst the human kind was plagued with an ambitious mind by birth possessed with ample store he sighed and vainly wished for more and restless deemed his royal lot pent up within too small a spot possessed of this in waking dreams he laid ten thousand frantic schemes projected conquests far and wide extended rule on every side saw savage nations fall before him and many thousands more adore him nay saw in his unbounded plan his scepter sway the tyrant man at length vouchsafing to impart the mighty purpose of his heart a fox who many years had been chief actor in each busy scene and therefore well knew how to fix the real worth of politics who warmed with patriotic zeal preferred to gain the common weal presumed without disguise to ask that he might share his princes task or happily cool by timely truth the ardour of impetuous youth why thus my friend the lion cries beyond myself i mean to rise and more texalt my present state henceforth to be surnamed  the great thou know the forest which lies south beyond the golden valleys mouth with awful caves and choice of sport where tiger keeps his mimic court i will seize by force the vast domain to add new strength and grace my reign from thence with most resistless force march to the sable rivers course hurl haughty leopard from his throne and make that plenteous realm my own then our victorious banners wave till elephant becomes my slave inferior princes at my call must homage pay and prostrate fall thus when a world salutes me king and boundless nations tribute bring i will turn toward my native soil and there enjoy my glorious toil the fox replied your royal name my liege and your immortal fame joined to your happy kingdoms good i tender dearly as my blood this forces truth upon my tongue and pardon claims should i be wrong look round and see with calm content the realm you govern by descent with heavens best gifts supremely blessed with plenty crowned and joy and rest see happiness through every part diffused to glad your princely heart each beast with pleasure howls your praise and views you with admiring gaze what then should more a king rejoice than loyaltys approving voice i know great sir that young in life unpracticed too in martial strife ambition cries your mighty paw should keep the prostrate world in awe but let the restless source of care be banished from your bosom far that fever of an heated mind to yours and general safety blind suppose for once the fairest view which fame and fortune could pursue suppose success with rapid force should urge you over a downhill course that every wind and every stream should waft you toward your golden dream nay grant beyong the utmost scope of warmest wish and boldest hope ten thousand cares unknown before surrounding will perplex you more our history like that of man will contradict your dangerous plan for jealous eyes must still pursue your conquests with malicious view compulsion sage experience shows an origin of restless foes and limbs beyond the body grown may overweigh perhaps your throne next let reflections eye advance and view with care precarious chance the fate of war in balance hung may speak with most persuasive tongue let fancy like a faithful scout bring to your sight a total rout behold your scattered warriors fly or vanquished in the battle die with fell revenge the conqurors burn to waste your kingdom in return on every side your subjects fall what power can banished life recall see desolations dreary face glare horrible in every place by no restrictive rulers awed see famine murder stalk abroad see all which seen makes nature shrink and learn my prince betimes to think you judge perhaps an active mind in peaceful times too much confined and think with glorys dreams possessed that all but war is slothful rest yet monarchs in the calmest hour may show the brightest beams of power to frame new wholesome laws or give due influence to those which

scars heroic signals of his wars by frequent conquests grew so vain that glory turned his martial brain and made the images of fight haunt all his wishes day and night a feathered quixote fit for battle with men with windmills or with cattle for if he might his prowess show he valued not what kind of foe one day an honest pointer went with humble competence content to scrape the dunghill for a bone which having hid he thought his own the cock observed with jealous eye crowd clapped his wings and drawing nigh declared by all the powers of fate no thief should plunder his estate the dog by

harmless lace must piety upon her back still wear a formal robe of black can none expire in honors bed but martial spirits bound in red it is all a farce and none but fools would judge by such contracted rules you have boldly charged me home with treason against the sacred power of reason but wherefore so all things on earth from some good purpose draw their birth and rightly managed serve

streaming from the great through each department of a state should as untainted snow be fair and spread around with virtuous care for be it either good or bad most ranks are fashionably mad an eagle who had seen with pain licentiousness extend its reign whose more than usual patriot eye saw most in birds of quality saw marriage like compulsive tether his lords and ladies link together with scarce a spark of love to light the scanty space of wedding night who saw gallants and mistresses the several parties better please who saw destructive cards and dice in triumph lead domestic vice who saw a love of foreign fashions with endless idle dissipations infect bats owls and carrion crows as well as gaudy wellplumd beaus who saw discretion yield to pride but chiefly on the female side kindly resolved by wisdom led a partner for his royal bed that subjects looking to the throne from virtues there might form their own the proselyte of prudent love he fixed his choice upon a dove whom nature had with partial care created good as well as fair with open hand benevolence the child of virtue and of sense dispersed her various bounties round with multitudes of blessings crowned a constant and engaging mate she smoothed her consorts cares of state whose captive heart each coming day owned more and more her gentle sway which never aimed at any power but that of sweetning every hour mothers from her might fully prove the raptures of maternal love and sure no offspring ever could bring more of joy or public good mild condescension smoothed her brow and taught ill judging pride to bow whenever she cood the subjects hung with rapture on her tuneful tongue and those were ever most admired who caught that goodness she inspired each couple like the royal pair still sympathizd in joy and care till hymen with peculiar grace was seen to smile in every place even fickle wanton sparrows now would fashionably keep their vow perfect in every scene of life reviewed as mother friend or wife the truly royal dove was seen to act to coo to look the queen with charming form and gentle mind almost the charlotte of her kind fable xvii the roman and barbarian when rome was in her height of glory so find we in historic story struck with her universal fame a traveling barbarian came who wished in all her parts to see that boasted seat of liberty a citizen engaged to show the stranger all he wished to know over all her sevn proud hills they strayed and various observations made the roman pointing to his guest those prospects which he fancied best there view our capitol he cries

before your footsteps trod the roman shore here the barbarian for that name those proud monopolists of fame the romans gave with partial sneer to all beyond their native sphere admitted on a curious view the several observations true yet seemed to say that solid sense never doated on magnificence did all says he this grandeur come by lawful means to lordly rome for why should many nations groan to deck a city not their own were she by emulative trade in wealth and power superior made did she not gain her boasted charms by rapine and the force of arms could all her pompous marks of state avert the unerring shafts of fate for once she must her ruin mourn like other empires in her turn could power and grandeur time defy nor romans like barbarians die could they procure a better lot in future worlds when here forgot could they on lifes precarious stage but add one scene to failing age could they from sickness take its pains or harmonize disordered brains could they with kind instructive art inform the head and mend the heart could they the hours misspent recall and shed divine content on all the world might then with justice come and worship your unrivaled rome but as it is  excuse a truth not the less certain though uncouth since sure it cannot be denied they only serve to pamper pride fable xviii the politic lion in life no error more appears than ill adapted characters who would not either laugh or cry the contrast of philosophy to see a valiant soldier loll and slumber in a prebends stall devoid of piety and knowledge who shames eeligion and the college his morals naught but outward show and shines a most irrevrend beau what other feelings strike the heart to see the grave physicians part disgraced by those as often is seen who good mechanics might have been to see a genius formed for trade a blundring pettyfogger made to see a farming country squire sent up a silent knight of the shire  to see a poet or musician commencing shallow politician in short to see as sense must own so many men turned upside down and reasons dictates cast aside by folly avarice or pride when each man in a proper place might act his part with decent grace a lion who with sovereign sway the forest ruled  one council day among the subject beasts declared that he and they must stand prepared a most tremendous war to wage demanding wisdom strength and rage let all he

warriors with such speed as suits a time of pressing need for this the wisest means pursue ourself will take the grand review his royal mandate spread about all royal beasts began their route the hare and ass with others came through duty more than love of fame whom when the cynic bear beheld with savage laugh he shook the field then said with an ironic sneer oh welcome valiant creatures here  what monarchs shrink at wars alarms when such as you cry out  to arms heroes for boundless conquest made  of nothing but disgrace afraid the bashful couple in dismay held down their heads and slunk away  too often modest worth and sense give place to hardened impudence just then the lion passing by beheld them with indulgent eye and having kindly asked their cases declared they should be fixed in places  which certainly though not so great as many others in the state had still their worth and were of use beyond the reach of proud abuse then turning to the bear he cried how durst you sir indulge your pride if you had been as wise as strong your sense would then have checked your tongue  good subjects must be dear to me whether of high or low degree indeed should i so grossly err unworthy creatures to prefer should i so far from prudence wander to make an ass or hare commander my subjects might with cause complain and stigmatize my simple reign but while i with impartial spirit pay due regard to honest merit while just gradation forward leads and beasts are valued for their deeds they will well perform their several parts and i reign monarch of their hearts those creatures you so much disdain when thus disposed shall credit gain the stentorass shall loudly rattle and bray with martial sound  to battle and on occasion help to bear provisions  while this nimble hare shall serve for which you will all confess she is well designed to go express  to scout and watch with curious eye the motions of our enemy thus or my judgment is outwitted their business and their powers are fitted in movements of a grand machine small wheels as well as great are seen  so may the least in any nation be put into an useful station and public good will flourish most where each supplies his proper post fable xix the charioteer a charioteer not one of those who galloped in olympic shows but one who on newmarkets sod was worshipped as a demigod who out of any thing could

politely by the gods old shaver must have taken the odds  exulting thus whipped sharp his cattle  who sprung and made the carriage rattle scarce had he gone three hundred yards ere adverse fate his course retards a failing wheel with crashing noise the speed of sanguine hope destroys and on the ground in full career lays low the astonished charioteer who cursed the chance in modish phrase and stard around with stupid gaze the sober cit came jogging on and saw dismounted phaeton he saw the prostrate ruin lie on which he cast a leering eye and thus addressed with taunting sneer  i did not

haste the worse we speed yet some with prudence still at strife post neck or nothing on through life but soft  farewell  for more delay will too much check my stinted way the sun declining loses light  i wish you luckless friend good night fable xx the angel and hermit a statesman who as records tell could vie in fame with machiavel had served his country several years with able head in different spheres and strange to tell had played his part even envy owned with honest heart though sometimes stung with partial blame to cramp if not to taint his fame a certain though a cruel case  sad consequence and tax of place at length impatient of the weight which hangs on those who guide a state his mind its secret wishes bent in solitude to seek content soon as reflection had inspired the pleasing prospect he retired fixed on a lonely rural spot and changed his palace for a cot his levees for the illustrious dead whom in their living works he read all equipage was dropped of course or shrunk into a single horse on whom he rode for sake of health which wisdom owns the richest wealth art had not with affected grace deformed this native lovely place where variegated prospects grew successively to charm the view where nature through the landscape smiled a picture beautifully wild where study found a still retreat and virtue seemed to fix her seat one day reclining in a shade by overspreading poplars made disposed at large to ruminate our voluntary hermit sat and safe he thought from listening ear thus praised his calm contented sphere hail a sequestered state  all hail  on woodcrownd hill or flowery vale where mind and body both advance their faculties by temperance where smiling health around us sails enbosomd in refreshing gales where faction with discordant voice no more can interrupt my joys where envy with her poisonous tongue no more can taint my fame with wrong where smiling fairfacd heartless friends no more will haunt for selfish ends where treachry darkest

shroud a lightencircled angel came who hailed the hermit by his name then said i have heard thy full pretense to solitude and abstract sense which shows no more in reasons eye than unsubstantial sophistry if man is formed of social kind the duties of his station bind to play an active part in life however perplexed with cares and strife withdrawing to inglorious rest is indolence or fear at best a profitless and mean escape unworthy of the human shape it is owned that crowns are painful things that care may haunt the best of kings yet making many millions blessed must calm the mind and give it rest can any feel such joy of heart as they who act a patriot part there lies the worth of being great and true preeminence of state in solitude you seem to say that virtue rules with settled sway but know that passions in restraint amidst temptations form the saint a sot if unsupplied with wine must drunkenness perforce resign a thief by locks and bars shut out may boast of honesty no doubt yet characters like these i trust are neither sober deemed nor just suppose your worth and what more hard had failed to meet a just reward that errors of capricious power darkened your welldevoted hour suppose through hate or want of sense some schemes were crossed on false pretense should reason give resentment scope creating thence a misanthrope of every vice which man has tried nones worse than overbearing pride accustomed to direct her helm why should you leave your native realm in danger to be tempesttost perhaps her pilot wanting lost with love of rural ease inspired if like the roman you retired prepared with patriot love to stand the bulwark of your native land so far with reason on your side retirement might be justified yet those whose talents most excel should study most the public weal no meaner wretch can nature own than he who lives for self alone fable xxi the proud ass apert and selfsufficient ass not half so wise as balaams was who passed a round of daily care in hawking goods from fair to fair through ervy was so void of sense he scorned a decent competence for such though born an abject slave his more than tender master gave one day a pampered steed passed on decked out in rich caparison a mettled creature full of fire and shaped like his arabian sire at whom our ass with mournful sigh strait cast a tearencircled eye then turning to his owner said how dearly do i earn my bread not that i bear too great a load nor often feel your painful goad but then unkindly you neglect to gain me as you might respect pray what is yon prancer more than me to merit so much finery wherever he comes the hostler shows attention to his gaudy clothes the freshest hay supplies his rack a currycomb runs over his back and best of wheaten straw is spread beneath his hoofs to form a bed while i with paltry pannier clad the very thought would make one mad though doomed to labor still more hard can never meet with just regard if beauty be his foremost

bridle place as may adorn this comely face a net were well to strike the sight no matter whether green or white besides twould guard my tender thighs in summer from perplexing flies with ribbands plait my tail and mane so let me just importance gain or soon expect that settled grief will weigh me down beyond relief for sure no other means can save your faithful creature from the grave the pedlar foolish as his beast complied with all the fond request and decked the ass with simple care then led him to a crowded fair where gazing hundreds stopped his way and kept the rareeshow at bay our longeard beau assuming state would mimic too the managed gait while many a rude and painful thump saluted him from head to rump much laughter and a world of jokes accompanied the merry strokes some curses too from either side were vented on his foolish pride till terrified he brayed aloud submission to the shouting crowd and promised thenceforth to appear in trappings suited to his sphere a maxim some of human kind would worthy heir observance find for pride betrays each forward fool to all the stings of ridicule fable xxii the lawyer and fox it happened once a son of law who kept three market towns in awe who in his most important look all littleton conveyed and cook though neither had he ever read to furnish out a tricking head for nature gave sufficient art to play the pettifogging part one golden rule who practiced long to do no right  nor suffer wrong  resolved to war against the fox who nightly stole his feathered flocks shall reynard cried old nisi prius not plunder only but defy us shall such a thief my poultry fleece my ducks my turkies hens and geese nay more last night his maw to cram he robbed me of a fatted lamb i am now resolved to set a trap and should i catch the slippery chap with oaken towel first i will bang him and then upon a gibbet hang him the fox so matters came to pass who with strict zeal kept michaelmas by eating goose  upon its eve went slyly laughing in his sleeve to pick up one  oh hardened sinner  for his and spouses annual dinner the morning clock with drowsy tone upon its bell had just struck one in dreamless balmy slumbers blessed even village curs were lulled to rest no longer flowed the murmuring rill which served to work a neighboring mill love wakeful god no vigil kept and hodge forgetting mopsy slept silence and darkness most profound enwrappd the fearless village round when reynard reached the lawyers yard and ran direct o fortune hard where lay the trap there found too late the iron grasp of cruel fate he struggled vainly to get loose and cursed his foolish love of goose the morn at length in saffron robe came gayly smiling over the globe attended by the jocund hours and all her vivifying powers when from his roost descending low sir chanticleer prepared to crow the captive saw when in dismay he screamd and winged his fearful way  dame partlett heard the dire alarm sure signal of approaching harm obeyed the well known faithful sound and like its echo fluttered round ducks geese and turkies joined the cry with such prevailing energy that from his bed the lawyer rose with haste which disregarded clothes and ran directly to the place where culprit lay in doleful case whom when he saw with raptured eyes i have caught thee then at last he cries and will myself both judge and jury let loose upon thee all my fury thou murderous rogue infernal thief of all consummate villains chief for nothing that i know of good but basely shedding helpless blood a lingering fate shall stop thy breath and give thee inch by inch to death poor reynard heard the dreadful doom and wished the lawyer in his room he trembled yet resolved to die with most heroic dignity and now beyond the verge of hope he gave his tongue its utmost scope shall i he cried sustain abuse nor let though bound resentment loose be silent while a monster talks because upon two legs he walks and boasts of something reason named which all his actions have disclaimed a monster shameful to his kind to every honest feeling blind with tongue of guile with heart of flint and soul of villainy the mint what you sir lawyer thieving call in foxes is no crime at all impelled by nature we pursue our destined game with honest view to satisfy  and what more right the urgent calls of appetite nor seek with avaricious skill for sake of sordid gain to kill besides no fox ever robs his brother but mankind plunder one another and such as you are doubly cursed of all the human robbers worst who find in every case a flaw and justice put to flight by law if then of right you make a plea for partial sentence passed on me resign at once your ill got pelf and much more justly hang yourself fable xxiii the conqueror and captive success intoxicates the brain and sometimes makes the wisest vain who that examines age or youth can controvert so plain a truth that sees false fame or solid pelf so much increase important self that lilliputian worth can rise a mighty brobdignag in size thence mild benevolence is lost and tyrant pride assumes its post it happened once  suppose the time the regal titles and the clime there reigned a prince of mighty power who having much still wanted more who frenchman like with envious eye beheld the realms of liberty and still for war would frame pretense of glory stained or self defense behold him to the field burst forth an emblem of the boisterous north when with its most tempestuous gales it desolates hills woods and dales his often tried martial prowess spread through neighboring states a general dread an ape of mighty caesars name he went he saw and overcame  over bulwarkd towns he made his way while ravished conquest owned his sway one kingdom gained the next he viewed with eyes ambitious and pursued fortune that vain capricious dame who eager seemed to urge his fame like other ladies then most pleased when most solicited and teasd with partial grace still deigned to bless his boldest actions with success whose only business was to fight whatever the cause or wrong or right till glutted he at length declined to indulge the fever of his mind yet fond of pomp and madly vain he brought in his triumphant train six captive kings sad spoil of war to draw like beasts his splendid car the day was fixed when such a sight he thought would give the throng delight by various means most subjects strove to show their loyalty and love arches were raised and trophies placed in every spot which might be graced the victor almost deified by popular applause and pride could scarce vouchsafe to cast his eye on any thing beneath the sky and silently appeared to say all nature must admit my sway at length a downward look he gave and chanced to view one royal slave who turning eyed with thought profound the chariot wheel that circled round the placid smile which over his face had shed a mild peculiar grace the easy air and just disdain with which he wore his golden chain alarmed the victor who demanded what his attention so commanded my mind the captive cries is bent to calm misfortunes with content as in that circling wheel i see of life the brief epitome the part which now is highest must one single turn replace in dust so thou though present laurels bloom may ere thy bones shall reach the tomb by some inverted stroke of fate have cause to mourn thy fallen state without a friend to sooth thy care none follow tyrants in despair while vulture conscience stings thy mind for endless wrongs to human kind the greatest prince should learn this truth that sure as age succeeds to youth so time devouring swallows all empires themselves but rise to fall however glorious and renowned since life is but a varying round swift as an arrow to the heart conviction sent her pointed dart pride wished indeed to stop its course but yielded to resistless force and said that she would taint no more the bosom of the conqueror who from the car descending gave his hand to every royal slave unloosd their shackles and declared his power should henceforth be their guard should stand a barrier to the weak and all oppressions fetters break the captives struck due homage paid and for their kind deliverer prayed more careful now of native blood the unshaken friend of peace he stood disbanded conquest with her train for virtues of a patriot

elf enraptured with delightful self beheld a lark who sung hard by with much contempt and scornful eye the songster heard with patient ears a multitude of daily sneers and bore them all however absurd nor answered once the coxcomb bird but like a wise domestic did whatever his tender master bid no business minded but his own and studied grateful songs alone no spartan in the pilfring art could play with more success his part than did the magpye when set free to bear young master company whatever his bill and strength could take he bore away for mischiefs sake for things thus lost if servants fought twas happiness supreme he thought his mistress too he told of all which in the kitchen could befall what sweethearts were admitted there how long they staid and what their fare nor could the maidens undescried a secret dish of tea provide nay rather tattler like than fail he would soon invent a curious tale one morning all he thought at rest the greatest knaves are fools at best in triumph to the lark he cries what ho you warbler of the skies if any spirit fired your heart how could you act this humdrum part thus idly pass an useless age within the limits of your cage and only strain with empty note your most unprofitable throat while i am so active in the house i scarcely miss a stirring mouse i see i hear and straight unfold whatever may make our mistress scold who loves you know or right or wrong to exercise her ceaseless tongue and when i have made a hideous pother flings me some nice tit bit or other  besides it is my constant plan to steal and hide whatever i can then shrewdly tell the servants name i wish to brand with loss and shame thus little short as i can see of human wit and policy my happy talents are displayed of nothing but our cat afraid while you so little notice claim scarce once a week i hear your name and like the wild ones of your breed have no regale but sod or seed a servant maid at mornings break by love or conscience kept awake heard maggys tale when fired with rage she flew directly to his cage then seized him and with many a thump conveyed him underneath the pump where dousd and drenched almost to death while yet he drew some doubtful breath tattler lardella cried take that then threw him to the hungry cat the lark who heard but did not see this boasters sad catastrophe reflected thus designing knaves to sordid selfish passions slaves assisted by dishonest guile it is true may shine in life awhile but where at length is all their gain enjoying sweets to purchase pain to boast i find with vicious pride of useful talents misapplied a knavish heart and tattling tongue from whence arises social wrong will happily bring or soon or late repentance with untimely fate on no ambitious purpose bent with competence and ease content i envy not the brightest parts devoted to pernicious arts let me enjoy the songster said an honest heart and peaceful head fable xxv the fine lady and the sun wretches there are and many too whose wishes only self pursue let partial fortune deign to grant whatever their whims or passions want they value not should mankind all to sure and swift perdition fall a female more than helen fair whose beauty was her favorite care assaulted by meridian heat sought out in vain a cool retreat the glowing air now grown intense through each apartment gave offense which caused her so relates our tale against the sun himself to rail i wonder says the dainty dame that such a vile obnoxious flame so rude to fashionable eyes should every day ascend the skies or quitting of a distant sphere be suffered to approach so near spotless as new descended snow in winters happy time i show but when the summers heat takes place six horrid freckles shame my face nor dare i paint  oh dire vexation for fear of dreadful perspiration i wish kind heaven eternal night adorned with milder candlelight would rule the world with kindly sway and banish telltale useless day who hears from love so sweet a sound as when with friendly darkness crowned no needless blushes then disgrace with awkward shame a ladys face how often does this sun advance to spoil a game of cards or dance what jewels can so brightly blaze outlustred by his rival rays what charms so faultless can appear when his revealing light is near which never suffers friendly art to play with kind disguise its part it is hence that
