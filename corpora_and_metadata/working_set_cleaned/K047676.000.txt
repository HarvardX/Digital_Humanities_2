zenobia  zenobia a tragedy  as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  by the author of the orphan of china  london printed for w griffin in catharinestreet strand  mdcclxviii  p   s   d  to mrs dancer madam in a country where addresses of this nature have generally waited upon the great upon a wealthy merchant a rich commissary or some new man from the sugarislands it will appear as surprising to many as no doubt it will to yourself that a new form of dedication should now be introduced for the trouble i am giving you it will however be unnecessary to make any further apology when i observe that in france where talents are honored it has been frequently the practice of the most celebrated wits to do justice to those who by their profession are the very organ of the muses a voltaire and a marmontel have paid their compliments to a clairon and why may not an english author inferior as he is and ever must be to writers of that class rival at least their politeness by addressing himself to mrs dancer one of the first ornaments of the british theater  there are indeed i must confess it some demands upon my gratitude on this occasion which even now are struggling to call my attention another way mr garrick madam has a claim to all the handsome things that can be said of him his politeness from the moment he saw the play his assiduity in preparing it for representation the taste with which he has decorated it and the warmth of his zeal for the honor of the piece are circumstances that call upon me for the strongest acknowledgements i could employ my pen with pleasure in thanking mr barry for the very fine exertion of his powers wherever the poet gave the smallest opportunity mr holland who had before now given spirit to such scenes as mine has renewed the obligation i could add others to the list but they and even mr garrick at their head must excuse me if i turn to mrs dancer and say with hamlet here is mettle more attractive  zenobia madam is your own entirely wherever my inaccuracy has left imperfections they are so happily varnished over by your skill that either they are not seen or you extort forgiveness for them and if the author is any where happy enough to snatch a grace beyond his usual reach it is multiplied by your address into a number of beauties like the sword in tassos jerusalem which when brandished by the hand of rinaldo appears to the whole army to be three swords  the fate of zenobia has been very extraordinary she was saved in her lifetime from the waters of the araxes by the hand of a shepherd and now she is saved from the critics by mrs dancer  in testimony of the fact the play madam is now inscribed to you by him who admires your talents and remains  your most obedient servant the author march        prologue spoken by mr holland of old  when greece in a declining age of lawless power had felt the barbarous rage this was the tyrants art  he gave a prize to him who a new pleasure should devise ye tyrants of the pit whose cold disdain rejects and nauseates the repeated strain who call for rarities to quicken sense say do you always the reward dispense ye bards  to whom french wit gives kind relief are ye not often the first  to cry stop thief say  to a brother do you ere allow one little sprig one leaf to deck his brow no  fierce invective stuns the playwrights ears wits poets corner ledgers gazetteers it is said the tartar  ere he pierce the heart inscribes his name upon his poisoned dart that schemes rejected by each scribbling spark  our christian system  stabs you in the dark and yet the desperate author of tonight dares on the muses wing another flight once more a dupe to fame forsakes his ease and feels the ambition  here again to please he brings a tale from a far distant age enobled by the grave historic page tacitus ann lib    sect    to end of    zenobias woes have touched each polished state the brightest eyes of france have mourned her fate harmonious italy her tribute paid and sung a dirge to her lamented shade yet think not that we mean to mock the eye with pilferd colors of a foreign dye not to translate our bard his pen does dip he takes a play as britons take a ship they heave her down  with many a sturdy stroke repair her well and build with heart of oak to every breeze set britains streamers free newman her and away again to sea this is our authors aim  and if his art waken to sentiment the feeling heart if in hit scenes alternate passions burn and friendship love guilt virtue take their turn if innocence oppressed lie bleeding here you will give  it is all he asks  one virtuous tear  dramatis personae pharasmanes mr aickin rhadamistus mr barry teribazus mr holland zopiron mr packer tigranes mr hurst megistus mr

 zelmira the interval is horrid big with woe with consternation peril and dismay and oh if here while yet the fate of nations suspended hangs upon the doubtful sword if here the trembling heart thus shrink with horror here in these tents in this unpeopled camp oh think zopiron in yon field of death where number soon in purple heaps shall bleed what feelings there must throb in every breast how long ambition will thou stalk the earth and thus lay wastemankind   zopiron this day at length the warlike king victorious pharasmanes closes the scene of war  the roman bands but ill can cope with the embattled numbers asia pours forth a firm undaunted host a nation under arms  and every bosom to deeds of glory fired  iberia then   zelmira perish iberia  may the sons of rome pour rapid vengeance on her falling ranks that he who tramples on the rights of nature may see his vassals overwhelmed in ruin may from yon field be led in sullen chains to grace the triumph of imperial rome and

tears   pharasmanes it must not be  he raises her by heaven renown in arms in vain attends me if the loved graces of thy matchless form are thus depressed and languish in affliction like flowers that droop and hang their pining heads beneath the rigor of relentless skies  zenobia if thou would raise me from the depths of woe forgive those captives whom thy fatal anger adjudgd to death nor let illtimed resentment fall on the prince your son  twas i  my tears  my piercing lamentations won his heart to arrest their doom   pharasmanes for traitors to my crown does ariana plead   zenobia for mild humanity my suppliant voice is raised  i point the means to add new glory to your fame in arms in naught so near can men approach the gods as the dear act of giving life to others  in feats of war the glory is divided to all imparted  to each common man  and fortune too shall vindicate her share   but of sweet mercy  the vast vast renown is all your own nor officer nor soldier can claim a part  the praise the honored praise adorns the victor  nor is the echo lost midst shouts of armies and the trumpets sound he conquers even victory itself than hero more  a blessing to the world   pharasmanes thy eloquence disarms my stubborn soul but wherefore urgent thus  amidst the band is there who claims thy soft solicitude  zenobia a hoary sage  alas a more than father  the best of men  preserver of my being  a blameless shepherd  rude of fraud and guilt innoxious through his life  oh mighty king spare an old man  a venerable sire naught has your fortune greater than the power to

honors wait him  honors fit for him who gave thee birth  for him whose virtue thy generous soul deems worthy it is esteem  zenobia our humble station seeks nor pomp nor splendour  we only ask unenvied and obscure to live in blameless innocence  to seek our calm retreat embraced in depth of woods and dwell with peace and humble virtue there  pharasmanes that coy disdain which shuns admiring eyes attracts the more exalting every charm no more of humble birth  thy matchless beauty like gems that in the mine conceal their luster was formed to dignify the eastern throne my scepter that strikes terror to each heart graced by thy decent hand shall make each subject adore thy softer sway  the glorious era of pharasmanes love  his date of empire with ariana shared henceforth begins and leads the laughing hours  but first the storm of war and wild commotion must be hushed  that mighty care now calls me to my throne to give the roman audience audience fit to strike a citizen of rome with awe when he beholds the majesty of kings  going enter teribazus teribazus dread sir the roman embassy approaches  from yonder rampart that invests your camp i heard their horses hoofs with eager speed beat the resounding soil   pharasmanes let em approach  and thou whose arrogance  but i forbear  when ariana pardons my resentment yields to her smile and looks away it is rage as when the crimes of men joves wrath demand and the red thunder quivers in his hand the queen of love his vengeance can disarm with the soft eloquence of every charm control his passions with resistless sway and the impending storm smile to serenest day  exit with his train zenobia teribazus  teribazus and may i then once more thou bright perfection may teribazus once again approach thee while thus my father  my ambitious father at sight of thee forgets his cruel nature and wonders how he feels thy beautys power oh may i  but i am too importunate  your looks rebuke me from you  and i see how hateful i am grown   zenobia mistake me not nor rashly thus arraign the looks of one whose heart lies bleeding here  thy generous worth is often the livelong day my favorite theme but oh for me  for wretched ariana the god of love long since has quenched his torch and every source of joy lies dead within me  teribazus that cold averted look  but i am used to bear your scorn  your scorn that wounds the deeper masked as it is with pity and esteem yet love incurable  relentless love burns here a constant flame that rises still and will to madness kindle should i see that hoard of sweets that treasury of charms yield to another to a barbarous rival who persecutes a son to his undoing  zenobia if arianas happiness would wound thee thou wilt never have cause to murmur or repine naught can divorce me from the black despair to which i have long been wedded   teribazus calm disdain i grant you well becomes the tyrant fair whom pharasmanes destines for his throne but oh in pity to this breaking heart give me in mercy give some other rival whom i may stab  without remorse may stab midst his delight in all his heaven of bliss and spurn him from the joys that scorpionlike shoot anguish here  here through my very soul  zenobia alas too generous prince the gods long since between us both fixed their eternal bar  terebazus what say thou ariana  ha beware nor urge me to destraction  love like mine fierce generous wild  with disappointment wild may rouse my desperate rage to do a deed will make all nature shudder  love despised not always can respect the ties of nature   driven to extremes the tenderest passion scorned may hate at length the object it adores and stung to madness  no  inhuman fair you still must be  in all vicissitudes in all the scenes misfortune has in store you still must be the sovereign of my soul but for the favored for the happy rival by heaven who ever he be  despair and phrenzy may strike the blow and dash him from your arms a sacrifice to violated love  zenobia why thus distract yourself with vain suspicions  you have no rival whom your rage can murder   none in the power of fate  oh teribazus the wretched ariana  long long since   my heart swells over  i

tear me piecemeal  it is just zenobia  i deserve it all   falls upon zopiron zopiron assist him guardian powers  your own high will guides these events  revive my prince revive  rhadamistus why thus recall me to despair and horror to bid me hate the light detest myself traitor to nature  traitor to my love  and yet zopiron  yet i am not plunged so far in guilt but thou may pity me  heaven i attest  yes you can witness gods i meant to perish with her  but the fates denied that comfort  from her circling arms the torrent bore me far  expiring senseless gasping in death the overflowing tide impetuous drove me on the unwishd for shore  there soon deserted by the merciless stream a band of romans as from syrias frontier they ranged the country round  descried me stretched pale and inanimate  with barbarous pity they lent their aid and chained me to the rack of inauspicious life   zopiron for wondrous ends mysterious providence has still reserved you to circulate the happiness of millions a patriot prince   rhadamistus would they had let me perish  what has a wretch like me to do in life when my zenobias lost  it is true my friend she begged to die  but that pathetic look her tears embraces and those streaming eyes still beauteous in distress  each winning grace her every charm should have forbid the deed and pleaded for her life  zopiron and yet my prince when selfacquitting conscience   rhadamistus selfcondemned my soul is racked  is tortured  not her child her unborn infant  the first fruit of love not even her babe could with the voice of nature plead for itself  or for it is wretched mother  they perished both  she and her little one and i survive to tell it   zopiron let not grief overwhelm your reason thus  what when your father your cruel father reeking from the blood of mithridates   rhadamistus naught but death was left yet even that last sad refuge was debarred me  ever since i have lived in misery  my days were colored all with anguish and despair long from the romans i concealed my name at length revealed me to a chosen friend   journeyd with him to rome and in full senate told all the dismal story of my woes the conscript fathers heard and dropped a tear  then to quick vengeance fired dispatched their legions to wage the war paulinus leads them on and now to me commits this embassy with fully delegated powers from rome  zopiron with one united voice armenia calls for mithridates heir  convinced by rumor that thou art lost the general cry demands your brother teribazus   rhadamistus he zopiron is to these eyes a stranger   zopiron hapless prince a cloud of woes lies brooding over his head a fair a lovely captive rules his heart her name is ariana and indeed no wonder she attracts his soft regard and kindles all the vehemence of love the tyrant eyes her too with fierce desire  and ruin nods over teribazus head  rhadamistus by heaven it shall not be  alas i know the pang of losing whom the heart adores  i will yield him up armenia  what are crowns but toys of vain ambition when the loved the dear pertaker of my throne is lost  enter tigranes zopiron what would tigranes  tigranes pharasmanes calls flamminius to his presence   rhadamistus i attend him  so tell your king   tigranes instant he waits thee roman  exit rhadamistus how my heart trembles at the awful meeting  zopiron then summon all your strength  the lapse of time from early youth when pharasmanes saw you afflictions inward stroke  that roman garb all will protect and cloak you from detection   rhadamistus zopiron yes in this important crisis when violated laws and injured men when my own wrongs are laboring in my heart the great occasion calls for firmest vigor yes in this interview i will maintain a romans part  in pharasmanes soul i will wake the furies of detested guilt and pour the rapid energy of truth till even to himself his crimes are known and the usurper tremble on his throne  end of the second act act the third pharasmanes on his throne tigranes zopiron officers etc pharasmanes where is this bold republican from rome this enemy of kings  tigranes thou bid the plebeian enter  pharasmanes vouchsafes him audience   enter flamminius pharasmanes now flamminius say what motive brings you to araxes banks to wage this slow this philosophic war  rhadamistus by me unworthy of the important charge by me unequal to the arduous theme the conscript fathers here explain their conduct and justify the ways of rome to kings  pharasmanes roman thou may declaim with all thy pomp of idle eloquence  rhadamistus no power of words no graceful periods of harmonious speech dwell on my lip  the only art i boast is honest truth unpolished unadorned  truth that must strike conviction to your heart truth that informs you  to usurp a crown for dire ambition to unpeople realms are violations of each sacred law and bid the roman eagle winged with vengeance to the araxes margin bend her flight to tell destruction it shall rage no more  pharasmanes and dares paulinus soldier  dare thou slave thus offer vile indignity and mouth the language of your forum to a king  rhadamistus rome knows and owns you as iberias king but not armenias   pharasmanes ha   rhadamistus the assembled senate acknowledges your vast renown in arms and honors the unshaken fortitude even of a foe  but sir the fortitude whose brutal rage lays nations desolate it is the glory of imperial rome to humble and subdue  it is the glory of rome that spares the vanquished it is her pride to set the nations free  to fix the bounds of the fell tyrants power  to trace the circle from which he must not move  these are the arts the bright prerogative of rome  of rome the mistress of the world whose conquering banners over asias realms so often have waved in triumph and made even kings her subjects   pharasmanes ha vain boaster  rhadamistus made oriental kings short by the knee accept their crown with tears of joy accept it and be the viceroys of a roman senate  pharasmanes and this to pharasmanes  has not yet a train of conquests taught you to revere this good right arm in war  this arm the parthians have felt with fatal overthrow  no spoil no trophies won from me have graced their triumphs no friends of mine were harnessed to their chariots  no captive chief like your own mangled crassus there roams a sullen ghost and calls for vengeance for vengeance still unpaid and calls in vain for the sad funeral rites  would rome presume to wrest armenia from me  lo my banners from frosty caucasus to phasis banks wave high in air and shadow all the land call your embattled legions  or does rome all conquering rome that mistress of the world does she at length by her ambassadors negotiate thus the war  rhadamistus rome sir commands the subject world for she adores the gods  and their all powerful aid   pharasmanes would thou dispute my lawful claim  arm thee with sword and fire not with vain subtleties and idle maxims  armenias crown is mine  derived to me heir to a brother and a son deceased   rhadamistus and can a murderer can the midnight ruffian prove himself heir  by the assassins stab   pharasmanes thou base reviler   comes forward and draws his fabre tigranes moderate your fury it were unjust   holding him zopiron the character he bears  the laws of nations   pharasmanes thou base insolent who dare to wound the ear of sacred kings with a black crime that is horrible to nature   rhadamistus yes horrible to nature  yet the world has heard it all  thou art the man of blood a brothers blood yet smokes upon thy hand  not his white age his venerable looks not even his godlike virtues could withhold thee  gashd over with wounds he falls  he bleeds he dies without a groan he dies  that is thy work thine murderer thine   pharasmanes no more  the hand of heaven shook from the blasted tree the withered fruit   rhadamistus forbear the impious strain  it is the style ambition speaks when for a crown it stabs then dares with execrable mockry dares traduce the governing allrighteous mind  pharasmanes he harrows up my soul  and do thou think a mad mans ravings   rhadamistus since that hour accursed have thou not plunged thee deeper still in guilt your son  your blameless son   pharasmanes his crimes provoked a fathers wrath  his and zenobias crimes   rhadamistus she too  untimely lost  unbidden tears forbear to stream nor quite unman me thus  pharasmanes in tears  by heaven thou woman hearted slave those coward symptoms have some latent spring that lies concealed within that treacherous heart  rhadamistus they are the tears humanity lets fall when soft eyed beauty dies untimely slain  but to avenge her death arrayed in terror the roman legions   pharasmanes lead em to the charge  thou quit my camp  if when yon sun descends thou lingerst here the title of ambassador shall naught avail to save thee from my fury  rhadamistus ever that resign armenia  till

pharasmanes roman farewell  do thou tigranes issue forth my orders from tent to tent that each man stand prepared for the dead midnight hour  with silent march then will i pour with ruinous assault

look he cast that plainly spoke his little bosom heaved with various passions still would he seek you in each well known haunt each bower each cavern like the tender fawn that through the woodland seeks it is mother lost exploring all around with anxious eye and looking still unutterable grief lonely and sad and stung with keen regret  zenobia did my child weep  not much i hope   megistus with soothing tales i labored to beguile him from his sorrow  i promised your return  a gentle smile brightened his anxious look he sighed content and then i led him to a safer dwelling among the shepherds of the syrian vale who all have sworn to guard him as their own and in due season lead him to the romans  zenobia oh may those shepherds know the kindest influence of the indulgent heavens  yet why

human blood is that a day of glory  i sir have traversed over the field of death where war had spent its rage  had thou beheld that scene of horror  where unnumberd wretches in mangled heaps lay weltring in their gore where the fond father in the gasp of death wept for his children  where the lover sighed for her whom never more his eyes could view where various misery sent forth it is groans

lost her  in despair  with yearning heart i ranged the country round in fond pursuit  this is my crime  sure it is no crime to love such blooming innocence   pharasmanes dispel thy fears  thy love for ariana speaks thy virtue  that graceful form that symmetry of shape that bloom those features those lovedarting eyes all all attract that there each fond admirer could ever gaze enamored of her charms  megistus alas whatever the symmetry of shape whatever the grace that reveals in her feature glows in her bloom or sparkles in her eye they all are transient beauties soon to fade and leave inanimate that decent form inward affliction saps the vital frame incurable affliction  fixed in woe her eyes for ever motionless and dim gaze on the fancied image of her husband  pharasmanes her husband  megistus yes a husband severed from her by fatal chance  him she for ever sees with fancys gushing eye and seeks him still in fond excursions of delusive thought she pines each hour and even in blooming dies as drooping roses  while the worm unseen preys on their fragrant sweets still beauteous look and waste their aromatic lives in air  pharasmanes the rose transplanted to a warmer sky shall raise it is languid head and all be well  megistus her husband still survives and far remote he wanders in armenias realm   pharasmanes no more to call her his  by all my promised joys his doom is fixed  do thou straight seek thy daughter my loveliest ariana  in her ear breathe the mild accents of a fathers voice and reconcile her heart to love and me  megistus your pardon sir  it were not fit my voice should teach her to betray her holy vows  pharasmanes when pharasmanes speaks   megistus my life is his  and when he wills it it is devoted to him  but sir though poor  my honor still is mine it is all that heaven has given me  and that gift the gods expect i never should resign  pharasmanes and do thou hesitate  what when a crown invites thy daughter to imperial splendour  megistus oh not for me such splendour  i have lived my humble days in virtuous poverty to tend my flock to watch each rising flower each herb each plant that drinks the morning dew and lift my praise to the just gods on high  these were my habits these my only cares   these hands sufficed to answer my desires and having naught  yet naught was wanting to me  pharasmanes away thou slave  i would not quite despise thee  or yield your daughter or my swiftest vengeance falls on thy hoary head  a monarchs love shall seize her trembling to his eager arms then spurn her back a prey to wan despair till bitter anguish blast each withered charm and rave in vain for love and empire scorned   exit megistus alone fell monster go  inexorable tyrant  perhaps i should have soothed his lion rage with feigned compliance  ha  why sudden thus   enter zenobia zenobia the important hour megistus now approaches  lo the last blushes of departing day but feebly streak yon dim horizons verge my rhadamistus comes to guide my steps  through devious paths seek thou zopirons tent  thus we shall lull suspicion   megistus i obey  may guardian angels spread their wings around thee   exit zenobia alone yes the blessed gods who through the maze of fate have led us once again to meet in life will prove the friends of virtue to the last  ha  teribazus comes   zenobia teribazus  teribazus and is it given once

for the lost afflicted teribazus   zenobia yes the tear falls and the sigh heaves for thee  thy elegance of mind  the various graces that bloom around thee and adorn the hero  nay other ties there are which strongly plead and bid me tremble for thee  and yet  sad recompense for all thy friendship to warn thee hence  to bid thee shun my ways is all the gratitude i now can offer   teribazus thus must we part   zenobia a rival is at hand  here in the camp  an unexpected rival  sent by the gods  the idol of my soul  teribazus what say thou ariana  has another usurped thy heart  unkind relentless maid  since first thy beauty dawned upon my sight how have i loved  repented  yet loved on  even against you  against myself i struggled  present i fled you  absent i adored  i fled for refuge to the
