  the rape of the lock an heroicomical poem in five cantos  written by mr pope   a tonso est hoc nomen adepta capillo  ovid london printed for bernard lintott at the crosskeys in fleetstreet       to mrs arabella fermor madam it will be in vain to deny that i have some value for this piece since i dedicate it to you yet you may bear me witness it was intended only to divert a few young ladies who have good sense and good humor enough to laugh not only at their sexs little unguarded follies but at their own but as it was communicated with the air of a secret it soon found its way into the world an imperfect copy having been offered to a bookseller you had the goodnature for my sake to consent to the publication of one more correct this i was forced to before i had executed half my design for the machinery was entirely wanting to complete it  the machinery madam is a term invented by the critics to signify that part which the deities angels or demons are made to act in a poem for the ancient poets are in one respect like many modern ladies let an action be never so trivial in it self they always make it appear of the utmost importance these machines i determined to raise on a very new and odd foundation the rosicrucian doctrine of spirits  i know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a lady but it is so much the concern of a poet to have his works understood and particularly by your sex that you must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms  the rosicrucians are a people i must bring you acquainted with the best account i know of them is in a french book called le comte de gabalis which both in its title and size is so like a novel that many of the fair sex have read it for one by mistake according to these gentlemen the four elements are inhabited by spirits which they call sylphs gnomes nymphs and salamanders the gnomes or demons of earth delight in mischief but the sylphs whose habitation is air are the bestconditiond creatures imaginable for they say any mortals may enjoy the most intimate familiarities with these gentle spirits upon a condition very easy to all true adepts an inviolate preservation of chastity  as to the following cantos all the passages of them are as fabulous as the vision at the beginning or the transformation at the end except the loss of your hair which i always name with reverence the human persons are as fictitious as the airy ones and the character of belinda as it is now managed resembles you in nothing but in beauty  if this poem had as many graces as there are in your person or in your mind yet i could never hope it should pass through the world half so uncensured as you have done but let its fortune be what it will mine is happy enough to have given me this occasion of assuring you that i am with the truest esteem  madam your most obedient humble servant a pope    the rape of the lock canto i what dire offense from amorous causes springs what mighty quarrels rise from trivial things i sing  this verse to c  l muse is due this even belinda may vouchsafe to view slight is the subject but not so the praise if she inspire and he approve my lays say what strange motive goddess could compel a wellbred lord tassault a gentle belle oh say what stranger cause yet unexplord could make a gentle belle reject a lord and dwells such rage in softest bosoms then and lodge such daring souls in little men sol through white curtains did his beams display and opened those eyes which brighter shine than they now shock had given himself the rowzing shake and nymphs prepared their chocolate to take thrice the wrought slipper knocked against the ground and striking watches the tenth hour resound belinda still her downy pillow pressed her guardian sylph prolonged the balmy rest twas he had summoned to her silent bed the morning dream that hovered over her head a youth more glittering than a birthnight beau that even in slumber caused her cheek to glow seemed to her ear his winning lips to lay and thus in whispers said or seemed to say fairest of mortals thou distinguished care of thousand bright inhabitants of air if ever one vision touched thy infant thought of all the nurse and all the priest have taught of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen the silver token and the circled green or virgins visited by angelpowrs with golden crowns and wreaths of heavenly flowers hear and believe thy own importance know nor bound thy narrow views to things below some secret truths from learned pride concealed to maids alone and children are revealed what though no credit doubting wits may give the fair and innocent shall still believe know then unnumberd spirits round thee fly the light militia of the lower sky these though unseen are ever on the wing hang over the box and hover round the ring think what an equipage thou have in air and view with scorn two pages and a chair as now your own our beings were of old and once enclosed in womans beauteous mold thence by a soft transition we repair from earthly vehicles to these of air think not when womans transient breath is fled that all her vanities at once are dead succeeding vanities she still regards and though she plays no more oerlooks the cards her joy in gilded chariots when alive and love of ombre after death survive for when the fair in all their pride expire to their first elements the souls retire the sprights of fiery termagants in flame mount up and take a salamanders name soft yielding minds to water glide away and sip with nymphs their elemental tea the graver prude sinks downward to a gnome in search of mischief still on earth to roam the light coquettes in sylphs aloft repair and sport and flutter in the fields of air know farther yet whoever fair and chaste rejects mankind is by some sylph embraced for spirits freed from mortal laws with ease assume what sexes and what shapes they please what guards the purity of melting maids in courtly balls and midnight masquerades safe from the treacherous friend and daring spark the glance by day the whisper in the dark when kind occasion prompts their warm desires when music softens and when dancing fires it is but their sylph the wise celestials know though honor is the word with men below some nymphs there are too conscious of their face for life predestined to the gnomes embrace who swell their prospects and exalt their pride when offers are disdained and love denied then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain while peers and dukes and all their sweeping train and garters stars and coronets appear and in soft sounds your grace salutes their ear it is these that early taint the female soul instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll teach infants cheeks a bidden blush to know and little hearts to flutter at a beau often when the world imagine women stray the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way through all the giddy circle they pursue and old impertinence expel by new what tender maid but must a victim fall to one mans treat but for anothers ball when florio speaks what virgin could withstand if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand with varying vanities from every part they shift the moving toyshop of their heart where wigs with wigs with swordknots swordknots strive beaus banish beaus and coaches coaches drive this erring mortals levity may call oh blind to truth the sylphs contrive it all of these am i who thy protection claim a watchful sprite and ariel is my name late as i ranged the crystal wilds of air in the clear mirror of thy ruling star i saw alas some dread event impend ere to the main this mornings sun descend but heaven reveals not what or how or where warned by thy sylph oh pious maid beware this to disclose is all thy guardian can beware of all but most beware of man he said when shock who thought she slept too long leapt up and waked his mistress with his tongue twas then belinda if report say true thy eyes first opened on a billetdoux wounds charms and ardors were no sooner read but all the vision vanished from thy head and now unveiled the toilet stands displayed each silver vase in mystic order laid first robbed in white the nymph intent adores with head uncovered the cosmetic powers a heavenly image in the glass appears to that she bends to that her eyes she rears the inferior priestess at her altars side trembling begins the sacred rites of pride unnumberd treasures open at once and here the various offerings of the world appear from each she nicely culls with curious toil and decks the goddess with the glittering spoil this casket indias glowing gems unlocks and all arabia breaths from yonder box the tortoise here and elephant unite transformed to combs the speckled and the white here files of pins extend their shining rows puffs powders patches bibles billetdoux now awful beauty puts on all its arms the fair each moment rises in her charms repairs her smiles awakens every grace and calls forth all the wonders of her face sees by degrees a purer blush arise and keener lightnings quicken in her eyes the busy sylphs surround their darling care these set the head and those divide the hair some fold the sleeve while others plait the gown and bettys praised for labors not her own the rape of the lock canto ii not with more glories in the etherial plain the sun first rises over the purpled main than issuing forth the rival of his beams lanchd on the bosom of the silver thames fair nymphs and welldrest youths around her shone but every eye was fixed on her alone on her white breast a sparkling cross she wore which jews might kiss and infidels adore  her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose quick as her eyes and as unfixd as those favors to none to all she smiles extends often she rejects but never once offends bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike and like the sun they shine on all alike yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride might hide her faults if belles had faults to hide if to her share some female errors fall look on her face and you will forget em all this nymph to the destruction of mankind nourished two locks which graceful hung behind in equal

the prize aspired resolved to win he meditates the way by force to ravish or by fraud betray for when success a lovers toil attends few ask if fraud or force attained his ends for this ere phoebus rose he had implored propitious heaven and every power adored but chiefly love  to love an altar built of twelve vast french romances neatly gilt there lay the swordknot sylvias hands had sown with flavias busk that often had rappd his own a fan a garter half a pair of gloves and all the trophies of his former loves with tender billetdoux he lights the pyre and breaths three amorous sighs to raise the fire then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes soon to obtain and long possess the prize the powers gave ear and granted half his prayer the rest the winds dispersed in empty air but now secure the painted vessel glides the sunbeams trembling on the floating tides while melting music steals upon the sky and softened sounds along the waters die smooth flow the waves the zephyrs gently play belinda smiled and all the world was gay all but the sylph  with careful thoughts oppressed the impending woe sat heavy on his breast he summons strait his denizens of air the lucid squadrons round the sails repair soft over the shrouds aerial whispers breath that seemed but zephyrs to the train beneath some to the sun their insectwings unfold waft on the breeze or sink in clouds

thames with pride surveys his rising towers there stands a structure of majestic frame which from the neighboring hampton takes its name here britains statesmen often the fall foredoom of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home here thou great anna whom three realms obey do sometimes counsel take  and sometimes tea hither the heroes and the nymphs resort to taste awhile the pleasures of a court

his burning ray the hungry judges soon the sentence sign and wretches hang that jurymen may dine the merchant from the exchange returns in peace and the long labors of the toilette cease  belinda now whom thirst of fame invites burns to encounter two adventrous knights at ombre singly to decide their doom and swells her breast with conquests yet to come strait the three bands prepare in arms to join each band the number of the sacred nine soon as she spreads her hand the aerial guard descend and sit on each important card first ariel perched upon a matadore then each according to the rank they bore for sylphs yet mindful of their ancient race are as when women wondrous fond of place behold four kings in majesty revered with hoary whiskers and a forky beard and four fair queens whose hands sustain a flower the expressive emblem of their softer power four knaves in garbs succinct a trusty band caps on their heads and halberds in their hand and part colored troops a shining train draw forth to combat on the velvet plain the skilful nymph reviews her force with care let spades be trumps she said and trumps they were now move to war her sable matadores in show like leaders of the swarthy moors spadillio first unconquerable lord led off two captive trumps and swept the board as many more manillio forced to yield and marched a victor from the verdant field him basto followed but his fate more hard gained but one trump and one plebeian card with his broad sabre next a chief in years the hoary majesty of spades appears puts forth one manly leg to sight revealed the rest his manycolourd robe concealed the rebel knave that dares his prince engage proves the just victim of his royal rage even mighty pam that kings and queens oerthrew and mowed down armies in the fights of lu sad chance of war now destitute of aid falls undistinguished by the victor spade thus far both armies to belinda yield now to the baron fate inclines the field his warlike amazon her host invades the imperial consort of the crown of spades the clubs black tyrant first her victim died spite of his haughty mien and barbarous pride what boots the regal circle on his head his giant limbs in state unwieldy spread that long behind he trails his pompous robe and of all monarchs only grasps the globe the baron now his diamonds pours apace the embroidered king who shows but half his face and his refulgent queen with powers combined of broken troops an easy conquest find clubs diamonds hearts in wild disorder seen with throngs promiscuous strew the level  thus when dispersed a routed army runs of asias troops and africks sable sons with like confusion different nations fly in various habits and of various dye the pierced battalions disunited fall in heaps on heaps one fate oerwhelms them all the knave of diamonds now exerts his arts and wins oh shameful chance the queen of hearts at this the blood the virgins cheek forsook a livid paleness spreads over all her look she sees and trembles at the approaching ill just in the jaws of ruin and codille and now as often in some distempered state on one nice trick depends the general fate an ace of hearts steps forth the king unseen lurked in her hand and mourned his captive queen he springs to vengeance with an eager pace and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky the walls the woods and long canals reply oh thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate too soon dejected and too soon elate sudden these honors shall be snatched away and cursed for ever this victorious day for lo the board with cups and spoons is crowned the berries crackle and the mill turns round on shining altars of japan they raise the silver lamp and fiery spirits blaze from silver spouts the grateful liquors glide and chinas earth receives the smoking tide at once they gratify their scent and taste while frequent cups prolong the rich repast strait hover round the fair her airy band some as she sipd the fuming liquor fanned some over her lap their careful plumes displayed trembling and conscious of the rich brocade coffee which makes the politician wise and see through all things with his half shut eyes sent up in vapors to the barons brain new stratagems the radiant lock to gain ah cease rash youth desist ever it is too late fear the just gods and think of vide ovid metam   scyllas fate changed to a bird and sent to flit in air she dearly pays for nisus injured hair but when to mischief mortals bend their mind how soon fit instruments of ill they find just then clarissa drew with tempting grace a twoedged weapon from her shining case so ladies in romance assist their knight present the spear and arm him for the fight he takes the gift with reverence and extends the little engine on his fingers ends this just behind belindas neck he spread as over the fragrant steams she bends her head swift to the lock a thousand sprights repair a thousand wings by turns blow back the hair and thrice they twitchd the diamond in her ear thrice she looked back and thrice the foe drew near just in that instant anxious ariel sought the close recesses of the virgins thought as on the nosegay in her breast reclined he watched the ideas rising in her mind sudden he viewed in spite of all her art an earthly lover lurking at her heart amazed confused he found his power expired resigned to fate and with a sigh retired the peer now spreads the glittering forfex wide tinclose the lock now joins it to divide even then before the fatal engine closed a wretched sylph too fondly interposed fate urged the sheers and cut the sylph in twain  see milton lib   but airy substance soon unites again the meeting points the sacred hair dissever from the fair head for ever and for ever then flashed the living lightnings from her eyes and screams of horror rend the affrighted skies not louder shrieks by dames to heaven are cast when husbands or when monkeys breath their last or when rich china vessels fallen from high in glittring dust and painted fragments lie let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine the victor cried the glorious prize is mine while fish in streams or birds delight in air or in a coach and six the british fair as long as atalantis shall be read or the small pillow grace a ladys bed while visits shall be paid on solemn days when numerous waxlights in bright order blaze while nymphs take treats or assignations give so long my honor name and praise shall live what time would spare from steel receives its date and monuments like men submit to fate steel did the labor of the gods destroy and strike to dust the imperial towers of troy steel could the works of mortal pride confound and hew triumphal arches to the ground what wonder then fair nymph thy hairs should feel the conquering force of unresisted steel the rape of the lock canto iv but anxious cares the pensive nymph oppressed and secret passions labored in her breast not youthful kings in battle seized alive not scornful virgins who their charms survive not ardent lovers robbed of all their bliss not ancient ladies when refused a kiss not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die not cynthia when her manteaus pinned awry  ever felt such rage resentment and despair as thou sad virgin for thy ravished hair for that sad moment when the sylphs withdrew and ariel weeping from belinda flew umbriel a dusky melancholy spright as ever sullied the fair face of light down to the central earth his proper scene repairs to search the gloomy cave of spleen swift on his sooty pinions flitts the gnome and in a vapor reached the dismal dome no cheerful breeze this sullen region knows the dreaded east is all the wind that blows here in a grotto sheltred close from air and screend in shades from days detested glare she sighs for ever on her pensive bed pain at her side and languor at her head two handmaids wait the throne alike in place but differing far in figure and in face here stood ill nature like an ancient maid her wrinkled form in black and white arrayed with store of prayers for mornings nights and noons her hand is filled her bosom with lampoons there affectation with a sickly mien shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen practiced to lisp and hang the head aside faints into airs and languishes with pride on the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe wrapped in a gown for sickness and for show the fair ones feel such maladies as these when each new nightdress gives a new disease a constant vapor over the palace flies strange phantoms rising as the mists arise dreadful as hermits dreams in haunted shades or bright as visions of expiring maids now glaring fiends and snakes on rolling spires pale specter gaping tombs and purple fires now lakes of liquid gold elysian scenes and crystal domes and angels in machines unnumberd throngs on every side are seen of bodies changed to various forms by spleen here living teapots stand one arm held out one bent the handle this and that the spout a pipkin there like homers tripod walks here sighs a jar and there a goosepye talks men prove with child as powerful fancy works and maids turned bottels call aloud for corks safe past the gnome through this fantastic band a branch of healing spleenwort in his hand then thus addressed the power  hail wayward queen who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen parent of vapors and of female wit who give the hysteric or poetic fit on various tempers act by various ways make some take physic others scribble plays who cause the proud their visits to delay and send the godly in a pett to pray a nymph there is that all thy power disdains and thousands more in equal mirth maintains but oh if ever thy gnome could spoil a grace or raise a pimple on a beauteous face like citronwaters matrons cheeks inflame or change complexions at a losing game if ever with airy horns i planted heads or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds or caused suspicion when no soul was rude or discomposed the headdress of a prude or ever to costive lapdog gave disease which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease hear me and touch belinda with chagrin that single act gives half the world the spleen the goddess with a discontented air seems to reject him though she grants his prayer a wondrous bag with both her hands she binds like that where once ulysses held the winds there she collects the force of female lungs sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues a vial next she fills with fainting fears soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears the gnome rejoicing bears her gift away spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day sunk in thalestris arms the nymph he found her eyes dejected and her hair unbound full over their heads the swelling bag he rent and all the furies issued at the vent belinda burns with more than mortal ire and fierce thalestris fans the rising fire o wretched maid she spread her hands and cried while hamptons ecchos wretched maid replied was it for this you took such constant care the bodkin comb and essence to prepare for this your locks in paperdurance bound for this with torturing irons wreathed around for this with fillets strained your tender head and bravely bore the double loads of lead gods shall the ravisher display your hair while the fops envy and the ladies stare honor forbid at whose unrivaled shrine ease pleasure virtue all our sex resign methinks already i your tears survey already hear the horrid things they say already see you a degraded toast and all your honor in a whisper lost how shall i then your helpless fame defend twill then be infamy to seem your friend and shall this prize the inestimable prize exposed through crystal to the gazing eyes and heightened by the diamonds circling rays on that rapacious hand for ever blaze sooner shall grass in hidepark circus grow and wits take lodgings in the sound of bow sooner let earth air sea to chaos fall men monkies lapdogs parrots perish all she said then raging to sir plume repairs and bids her beau demand the precious hairs  sir plume of amber snuff box justly vain and the nice conduct of a clouded cane with earnest eyes and round unthinking face he first the snuff box opened then the case and thus broke out  my lord why what the devil z  ds damn the lock before gad you must be civil plague on it it is past a jest  nay prithee pox give her the hair  he spoke and rappd his box it grieves me much replied the peer again who speaks so well should ever speak in vain but in allusion to achilles s oath in homer il   by this lock this sacred lock i swear which never more shall join its parted hair which never more its honors shall renew clipped from the lovely head where once it grew that while my nostrils draw the vital air this hand which won it shall for ever wear he spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread the longcontended honors of her head but umbriel hateful gnome forbears not so he breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow then see the nymph in beauteous grief appears her eyes half languishing half drowned in tears on her heaved bosom hung her drooping head which with a sigh she raised and thus she said for ever cursed be this detested day which snatched my best my favorite curl away happy ah ten times happy had i been if hampton court these eyes had never seen yet am not i the first mistaken maid by love of courts to numerous ills betrayed oh had i rather unadmird remained in some lone isle or distant northern land where the gilt chariot never marked the way where none learn ombre none ever taste bohea there kept my charms concealed from mortal eye like roses that in deserts bloom and die what moved my mind with youthful lords to rome o had i stayed and said my prayers at home twas this the morning omens did foretell thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell the tottering china shook without a wind nay poll sat mute and shock was most unkind a sylph too warned me of the threats of fate in mystic visions now believed too late see the poor remnants of this slighted hair my hands shall rend what even thy own did spare this in two sable ringlets taught to break once gave new beauties to the snowie neck the sisterlock now sits uncouth alone and in its fellows fate foresees its own uncurld it hangs the fatal sheers demands and tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands oh had thou cruel been content to seize hairs less in sight or any hairs but these   the rape of the lock canto v she said the pitying audience melt in tears but fate and jove had stopped the barons ears in vain thalestris with reproach assails for who can move when fair belinda fails not half so fixed the trojan could remain while anna begged and dido raged in vain to arms to arms the bold thalestris cries and swift as lightning to the combat flies all side in parties and begin the attack fans clap silks russle and tough whalebones crack heroes and heroins shouts confusedly rise and base and treble voices strike the skies no common weapons in their hands are found like gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound homer il  0 so when bold homer makes the gods engage and heavenly breasts with human passions rage against pallas mars latona hermes arms and all olympus rings with loud alarms joves thunder roars heaven trembles all around blue neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound earth shakes her nodding towers the ground gives way and the pale ghosts start at the flash of day triumphant umbriel on a sconces height clapped his glad wings and sat to view the fight propt on their bodkin spears the sprights survey the growing combat or assist the fray while through the press enraged thalestris flies and scatters deaths around from both her eyes a beau and witling perished in the throng one died in metaphor and one in song o cruel nymph a living death i bear cried dapperwit and sunk beside his chair a mournful glance sir fopling upwards cast a song in the opera of camilla those eyes are made so killing  was his last thus on meanders flowery margin lies the expiring swan and as he sings he dies as bold sir plume had drawn clarissa down chloe stepped in and killed him with a frown she smiled to see the doughty hero slain but at her smile the beau revived again vid homer il    and virg aen    now jove suspends his golden scales in air weighs the mens wits against the ladys hair the doubtful beam long nods from side to side at length the wits mount up the hairs subside see fierce belinda on the baron flies with more than usual lightning in her eyes nor feared the chief the unequal fight to try who sought no more than on his foe to die but this bold lord with manly strength indud she with one finger and a thumb subdued just where the breath of life his nostrils drew a charge of snuff the wily virgin threw the gnomes direct to every atome just the pungent grains of titillating dust sudden with starting tears each eye overflows and the high dome reecchoes to his nose now meet thy fate the incensed virago cried and drew a deadly bodkin from her side  in imitation of the progress of agamemnon s scepter in homer il   the same his ancient personage to deck her great great grandsire wore about his neck in three sealrings which after melted down formed a vast buckle for his widows gown her infant grandames whistle next it grew the bells she gingled and the whistle blew then in a bodkin graced her mothers hairs which long she wore and now belinda wears boast not my fall he cried insulting foe thou by some other shall be laid as low nor think to die dejects my lofty mind all that i dread is leaving you behind rather than so ah let me still survive and burn in cupids flames  but burn alive restore the lock she cries and all around restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound not fierce othello in so loud a strain roared for the handkerchief that caused his pain but see how often ambitious aims are crossed and chiefs contend till all the prize is lost the lock obtained with guilt and kept with pain in every place is sought but sought in vain with such a prize no mortal must be blessed so heaven decrees with heaven who can contest some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere vid ariosto canto    since all things lost on earth are treasured there there heros wits are kept in pondrous vases and beaus in snuffboxes and tweezercases there broken vows and deathbed alms are found and lovers hearts with ends of riband bound the courtiers promises and sick mans prayers the smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry but trust the muse  she saw it upward rise though marked by none but quick poetic eyes so romes great founder to the heavens withdrew to proculus alone confessed in view a sudden star it shot through liquid air and drew behind a radiant trail of hair not berenices locks first rose so bright the skies bespangling with disheveled light the sylphs behold it kindling as it flies and pleased pursue its progress through the skies this the beaumonde shall from the mall survey and hail with music its propitious ray this the blessed lover shall for venus take and send up vows from rosamondas lake this partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies when next he looks through galilaeos eyes and hence the egregious wizard shall foredoom the fate of louis and the fall of rome then cease bright nymph to mourn the ravished hair which adds new glory to the shining sphere not all the tresses that fair head can boast shall draw such envy as the lock you lost for after all the murders of your eye when after millions slain your self shall die when those fair suns shall set as set they must and all those tresses shall be laid in dust this lock the muse shall consecrate to fame and midst the stars inscribe belindas name finis
