the fashionable lover price   s   d  the fashionable lover a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  london printed for w griffin at garricks head in catharinestreet strand mdcclxxii  advertisement i commit this comedy to the press with all possible gratitude to the public for the reception it has met i cannot flatter myself that the same applause will follow it to the closet for as it owed much to an excellent representation i have neither on this nor any preceding occasion considered myself otherwise than as a sharer only with the managers and performers who have distinguished themselves in the exhibition of my trifling productions but it is not on the score of spectacle only that i am obliged to mr garrick i am both in the instance of this comedy and in that of the west indian materially indebted to his judgment and owe the good effect of many incidents in both to his suggestion and advice the correction of a real critic is as different from that of a pretender as the operation of a surgeon from the stab of an assassin  the comedy now submitted to the reader is designed as an attempt upon his heart and as such proceeds with little deviation from mine if it should be thought therefore that i have meant well the charge of having executed indifferently i shall patiently submit to i have on this occasion as on the two preceding ones wholly rested my performance upon such poor abilities as i am master of i am not conscious of having drawn any particular assistance either in respect of character or design from the productions of others although i am far from presuming to say or think that i have ever exhibited any character purely original the level manners of a polished country like this do not supply much matter for the comic muse which delights in variety and extravagance wherever therefore i have made any attempts at novelty i have found myself obliged either to dive into the lower class of men or betake myself to the outskirts of the empire the center is too equal and refined for such purposes  whether the reception of this comedy may be such as shall encourage me to future efforts is of small consequence to the public but if it should chance to obtain some little credit with the candid part of mankind and it is author for once escape without those personal and unworthy aspersions which writers who hide their own names fling on them who publish theirs my success it may be hoped will draw forth others to the undertaking with far superior requisites and that there are numbers under this description whose sensibility keeps em silent i am well persuaded when i consider how general it is for men of the finest parts to be subject to the finest feelings and i would submit whether this unhandsome practice of abuse is not calculated to create in the minds of men of genius not only a disinclination to engage in dramatic compositions but a languid and unanimated manner of executing them it will drive men from a necessary confidence in their own powers and it will be thought convenient to get out of the torrents way by mooring under the lee of some great name either french or italian and sitting down contented with the humble but less exposed task of translation should this take place a cold elaborate style will prevail in our drama clearly opposite to the national character and not at all at unison with the taste of our writers themselves correctness will become the chief object in view by which though much may be avoided little will be obtained nothing great can be accomplished on a plain turn to shakespeare and you find the alps not more irregular than his genius had the critics of his days marked his inaccuracies with that illiberal spirit which seems reserved for our time the bold and daring sallies of the sublimest muse would probably have been suppressed and neither the great actor who has brought his scenes to life nor the elegant essayist essay on the genius and writings of shakespeare who has defended them would have made such display of their own genius in the celebration and protection of his  richd cumberland  prologue spoken by mr weston in the character of a printers devil i am a devil so please you  and must hoof up to the poet yonder with this proof i would read it to you but in faith it is odds for one poor devil to face so many gods a ready imp i am who kindly greets young authors with their first exploits in sheets while the press groans in place of drynurse stands and takes the bantling from the midwifes hands if any author of prolific
