rimes  pingo mihi et arti  london printed for charles dilly  m dcc lxxxi  advertisement when such of the odes in this publication as extend to greater length were composed it was observed that whatever art might be used to diversify the cadence there was still somewhat wanting to the delight of the ear this defect was perceived to be chiefly owing to uniformity of stanza which protracted to any degree must ever fatigue as extinguishing the great source of all pleasure variety  to remedy this a particular series of stanzas was adopted in which the two first correspond and are succeeded by a third of as different a measure as might be this was thought to answer every intention proposed and appearing to present as perfect a succession of sounds as rhyme would admit was called by way of eminence melody  it was not till this plan was chosen after trying most modifications that rhyme could allow that it was considered that the very model of pindar was followed such authority added to the authors confidence in the perfection of his method but detracted much from the pride of invention by recalling to his memory the real truth which was that he had only revived the ancient term melos  mr congreve has long since observed in his discourse on the pindaric ode that the use of the strophe antistrophe and epode is obsolete and impertinent but such is the superstition for antiquity that they are retained to this day though even their ancient use and origin cannot be ascertained that as they are commonly used they confine the spirit of the greater modern ode without adding to its melody must be confessed yet they must be retained because they give it regularity this is the only reason of most modern poets for retaining them they seldom appear to have observed that in a long or grand production of the lyric kind the admission of a similar variety would contribute not a little to the riches of poetry  to have their full effect the strophe antistrophe and epode or as they are here denominated the cadence antiphony and unison must have the property either of distinct harmony or brevity every one must have observed that in the more elegant french and italian odes there are two distinct parts in every stanza these like the parts of a scots tune vary the measure and contribute exceedingly to entertain the ear for example in this stanza of malherbe cest en la paix que toutes chooses succedent selon nos desirs comme au printems naissent les roses en la paix naissent les plaisirs elle met les pompes aux villes done aux chams les moissons fertilles et de la majeste des loix appuyant les pouvoirs supremes fait demeurer les diademes fermes sur la test des rois the first four lines are of a melody distinct from the six last this plan was well followed by mr gray in his odes on the spring and eton college and that he was very sensible of this beauty appears from his observation inserted among the notes on mr masons edition of his poems there is says he a tout ensemble of sound as well as of sense in poetical composition always necessary to its perfection what is gone before still dwells upon the ear and insensibly harmonizes with the present line as in that succession of fleeting notes which is called melody so much for distinctness of harmony as to brevity the other requisite its effect is obvious  from these observations the reader will expect that the author has paid a particular regard to his numbers he has so he always considered harmony as the chief perfection of the ode music was indeed the first companion of lyric poetry and at this day who would not prefer a careless production of dryden though void of every excellence but harmony to the most labored of cowley though rendered heavy with the very gold of fancy  to the melodies in this collection succeed another species of lyric poetry here called symphonies by which name it is to be understood that the stanza is varied throughout as the subject seemed to demand an answering

win with languor to reside the great while gilded mansions hide the cot often shields the blessed but where beside a sunny hill that stems the eastern wrath the mazes of some nameless rill pursue their lonely path concealed amid the winding glade from vulgar eyes where groves in sable gloom arrayed their venerable refuge spread his lowly shed shall rise far from the plodding arts of care far
