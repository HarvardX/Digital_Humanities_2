the fair circassian a tragedy  price   s   d  the fair circassian a tragedy as performed at the theater royal drury lane  by the author of sympathy a poem  london printed for r baldwin no    paternoster row m dcc lxxxi  to his royal highness the prince of wales sir you are of an age when the heart opens to the most warm and generous impressions an age when all that gives worth and dignity to elevated rank takes full possession of the bosom at this bright and unprejudiced crisis of your life the precepts of omar and the practice of hamet as drawn by hawkesworth and dramatized by the author of this tragedy will win upon your attention not indeed by the attraction of poetry but by the natural reverence which unspotted youth ever renders and with delight to faithful representations of wisdom and of virtue the wisdom of the patriot the virtue of the prince  that your royal highness may very long reflect blessings on the people of england and prove a distinguished honor to the illustrious family who have that generous people in charge is the zealous prayer as it is the most empassioned expectation of  your royal highnesss most devoted and most dutiful servant the author  preface this tragedy borrows its general story and some of its incidents with as much of its sentiment as could be preserved from the very beautiful almoran and hamet of hawkesworth except that truth and justice call for such acknowledgement it would on any other score have been unnecessary for what can be added to the fame of a work universally celebrated the original machinery has been rejected because it would have been too daring an attempt to interweave it with the fable of a modern composition and perhaps too mighty a task to manage without violating the first great law of dramatick probability at the same time it has been the authors most assiduous endeavor to convert the sententious display of eastern wisdom as far as character would permit into the language of passion varied by every motive which might most forcibly affect the human mind in the most warm and interesting situations these are the words of a critic who seems fully to have penetrated the design of the author the lines with inverted commas were omitted in the representation to favor the rapidity of the action they are retained in the printed copy not more at the instance of particular friends than on general experience that those passages which retard the force of the passion on the theater are frequently read with most satisfaction in the closet  the play still continuing to be received on the stage with the most brilliant success the author would but half discharge the debt of equity were he to confess obligations to hawkesworth only the liberal perhaps the unequalled support which the managers have afforded by the scenery the interesting manner in which mr linley has set the epithalamium the taste of mr de loutherberg and the splendor which the performers have thrown over the characters by their excellent representation demand and receive the most warm and pointed expressions of gratitude there remains but one tribute of justice more and that is due to mr sheridan whose attention has on this occasion been friendship and whose assistance must always be fame  prologue by a friend spoken by mr bannister jun with trembling steps as if suspicious grown why does the tragic muse approach her throne her golden throne where once with grace divine the goddess sat supreme of all the nine turns her fair palace to the festive bower where jest and sport usurp her nobler power lost is each lovelier feeling that imparts to her the sovereign rule over british hearts sunk the pure taste which once secured her sway or wanes that virtue which admired her lay vain fears a generous race assembled here still pay to grief compassions softest tear still pay the heartfelt sigh which britons owe to natures feelings and to natures woe when jealous fiends othellos heart strings tear when guilty richard groans with dire despair when injured lear with torturing anguish wild pours the deep curse on each ungrateful child when plaintiff notes speak poor ophelias woes or love in juliets tender bosom glows the glistening eye the trembling lip proclaim nature and virtue here are still the same in sceptered state afflictions soothing strain still in your bosoms fix their steadfast reign  blessed seat of empire where the affections wait to shield the mourner from the shocks of fate  where the best passions with allegiance fair for suffering worth the healing balms prepare nor ever shall your hearts such rights forego what social sorrow asks these hearts shall still bestow no longer then oppressed with anxious fear the muse shall reasume her station here  shall court each virtue that is a nations pride and gain the nobler passions to her side  if in the tenor of her pensive lay in natures path to night she holds her way if she excites the sympathising mind to generous acts the glory of our kind this dread to the pit tribunal shall suspend its zeal spurn its proud office and grow proud to feel this radiant to the boxes circle too her hopes approve and grace the triumph of the muse they love  the following prologue from an honourgiving muse of which it is truly worthy did not arrive till after mr bannister was put in possession of the excellent poetry which precedes it and which another ingenious friend had been solicited to supply the author of the tragedy however thinks miss sewards composition too valuable to circulate only in manuscript indeed to keep such verses out of print would not only be a private injury to the piece which they will adorn but an unpardonable injustice to the public  prologue by miss seward slow from an ebon thrones majestic height a lovely form descends upon my sight the floating purple and the lofty mien proclaim the empress of the tragic scene divine melpomene  aggrieved she stands her tears fast falling on her folded hands the showry cloud thus dims the azure skies thus round the moon the misty halos rise why beauteous mourner ere the hour of woe throb those quick sighs those crystal sorrows flow thy fair circassian yet no griefs molest nor love nor fear assail her virgin breast but soft  the muse of anguish sadly speaks faint on my ear the murmuring accent breaks low hollow gales its mournful sounds convey and thus the goddess says  or seems to say can then the tender female bosom prove a keener pang than disappointed love ah me  for light thalia more than shares my darling sheridans too partial cares on her vain brows his lavish wreaths are thrown his thousand radiant gems emblaze her zone what though she gave to his supreme command each laughing grace that waits her potent wand yet with sublimer force my chemicfire with proud distinction decked his sacred lyre parody on a beautiful line in mr sheridans monody  to purest gold its warbling wires i turned when their sweet lays over lifeless garrick mourned and once he sung in see prologue to semiramis elevated strain my charms superior and my right to reign then with the majesty my impulse throws in chastend splendour round the poets brows he bade the tears that streamed over asias queen flow soft in real sorrows lonely scene  but soon he smiled those graceful tears away and faithless owned my frolic rivals sway perchance however the jocund pride of youth alone has warped from me his love and truth ere long the rover may again be mine and with his blooming laurels deck my shrine this night no vulgar hand the meed bestows that now for me in pristine beauty glows  oh may the fostring breath of public praise preserve from cruel blight the votive bays i hear no more  for with a pensive smile slow glides the muse down yonder winding isle may you ye brave and wise ye good and fair fulfill with suffrage kind her fervent prayer and since no force of wit and comic art can shut to pitys plaint

dearest treasure  omar full forty years olmana to this bosom ministerd every balm of virtuous softness passion from reason caught the wish composed the hope obedient and the steady purpose a life devote to nature and to heaven at length it pleased the gods to take her from me and pluck this pillow from my aged head her death was sudden but her life prepared in my first widowed days i felt as man at length her sacred spirit seemed to chide and whispered that it only went before to intercede the merciful for mine i left her with the gods and wept no more but come what says almeida  hamet how her name like sudden sunbeams darting through a cloud lights up an instant joy in hamets bosom oh had thou seen her all dissolved in passion  passion though yielding modestly chastisd and shaded by a delicate reserve only to look more lovely through the veil  had thou but seen her eloquently dumb sink in her fathers arms confess her softness in all the sweet disorders of the heart then blush
