may be found in a character without impairing the most unaffected piety  i have particularly reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance the undertaking a comedy not merely sentimental was very dangerous and mr colman who saw this piece in its various stages always thought it so however i ventured to trust it to the public and though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season i have every reason to be grateful  i am dear sir your most sincere friend and admirer oliver goldsmith  prologue by david garrick esquire enter mr woodward dressed in black and holding a

harmless and young of every thing asraid blushes when hired and with unmeaning action i hopes as how to give you satisfaction her second act displays a livelier scene  the unblushing barmaid of a country inn who whisks about the house at market caters talks loud coquets the guests and scolds the waiters next the scene shifts to town and there she soars the chop house toast of ogling connoissieurs on squires and cits she there displays her arts and on the gridiron broils her lovers hearts  and as she smiles her triumphs to complete even common councilmen forget to eat the fourth act shows her wedded to the squire and madam now begins to hold it higher pretends to taste at operas cries caro and quits her nancy dawson for che faro doats upon dancing and in all her pride swims round the room the heinel of cheapside ogles and leers with artificial skill till having lost in age the power to kill she sits all night at cards and ogles at spadille such through our lives the

year or two in town she is as fond of gauze and french frippery as the best of them   enter miss hardcastle hardcastle blessings on my pretty innocence dressed out as usual my kate goodness what a quantity of superfluous silk has thou got about thee girl i could never teach the fools of this age that the indigent world could be clothed out of the trimmings of the vain   miss hardcastle you know our agreement sir you allow me the morning to receive and pay visits and to dress in my own manner and in the evening i put on my housewifes dress to please you   hardcastle well remember i insist on the terms of our agreement and by the bye i believe i shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening   miss hardcastle i protest sir i dont comprehend your meaning   hardcastle then to be plain with you kate i expect the young gentleman i have chosen to be your husband from town this very day i have his fathers letter in which he informs me his son is set out and that he intends to follow himself shortly after   miss hardcastle indeed i wish i had known something of this before bless me how shall i behave it is a thousand to one i shall not like him our meeting will be so formal and so like a thing of business that i shall find no room for friendship or esteem   hardcastle depend upon it child i will never control your choice but mr marlow whom i have pitched upon is the son of my old friend sir charles marlow of whom you have heard me talk so often the young gentleman has been bred a scholar and is designed for an employment in the service of his country i am told he is a man of an excellent understanding   miss hardcastle is he   hardcastle very generous   miss hardcastle i believe i shall like him   hardcastle young and brave   miss hardcastle i am sure i shall like him   hardcastle and very handsome   miss hardcastle my dear papa say no more kissing his hand he is mine i will have him   hardcastle and to crown all kate he is one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world   miss hardcastle eh you have frozen me to death again that word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments a reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband   hardcastle on the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues it was the very feature in his character that first struck me   miss hardcastle he must have more striking features to catch me i promise you however if he be so young so handsome and so every thing as you mention i believe he will do still i think i will have him   hardcastle ay kate but there is still an obstacle its more than an even wager he may not have you   miss hardcastle my dear papa why will you mortify one so  well if he refuses instead of breaking my heart at his indifference i will only break my glass for its flattery set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer   hardcastle bravely resolved in the mean time i will go prepare the servants for his reception as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits the first days muster   exit miss hardcastle sola miss hardcastle lud this news of papas puts me all in a slutter young handsome these he put last but i put them foremost sensible goodnatured i like all that but then reserved and sheepish that is much against him yet cannot he be cured of his timidity by being taught to be proud of his wife yes and cannot i  but i vow i am disposing of the husband before i have secured the lover   enter miss neville miss hardcastle i am glad youre come neville my dear tell me constance how do i look this evening is there any thing whimsical about me is it one of my well looking days child am i in face to day   miss neville perfectly my dear yet now i look again  bless me  sure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes has your brother or the cat been meddling or has the last novel been too moving   miss hardcastle no nothing of all this i have been threatened  i can scarce get it out  i have been threatened with a lover   miss neville and his name    miss hardcastle is marlow   miss neville indeed   miss hardcastle the son of sir charles marlow   miss neville as i live the most intimate friend of mr hastings my admirer they are never asunder i believe you must have seen him when we lived in town   miss hardcastle never   miss neville he is a very singular character i assure you among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me   miss hardcastle an odd character indeed i shall never be able to manage him what shall i do pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success but how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother tony as usual   miss neville i have just come from one of our agreeable tete atetes she has been saying a hundred tender things and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection   miss hardcastle and her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so a fortune like yours is no small temptation besides as she has the sole management of it i am not surprised to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family   miss neville a fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation but at any rate if my dear hastings be but constant i make no doubt to be too hard for her at last however i let her suppose that i am in love with her son and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another   miss hardcastle my good brother holds out stoutly i could almost love him for hating you so   miss neville it is a good natured creature at bottom and i am sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself but my aunts bell rings for our afternoons walk round the improvements allons courage is necessary as our affairs are critical   miss hardcastle would it were bed time and all were well   exeunt scene an alehouse room several shabby fellows with punch and tobacco tony at the head of the table a little

what a tedious uncomfortable day have we had of it we were told it was but forty miles across the country and we have come above threescore   hastings and all marlow from that unaccountable reserve of yours that would not let us enquire more frequently on the way   marlow i own hastings i am unwilling to lay myself under an obligation to every one i meet and often stand the chance of an unmannerly answer   hastings at present however we are not likely to receive any answer   tony no offense gentlemen but i am told you have been enquiring for one mr hardcastle in those parts do you know what part of the country you are in   hastings not in the least sir but should thank you for information   tony nor the way you came   hastings no sir but if you can inform us    tony why gentlemen if you know neither the road you are going nor where you are nor the road you came the first thing i have to inform you is that  you have lost your way   marlow we wanted no ghost to tell us that   tony pray gentlemen may i be so bold as to ask the place from whence you came   marlow that is not necessary toward directing us where we are to go   tony no offense but question for question is all fair you know pray gentlemen is not this same hardcastle a crossgrained oldfashioned whimsical fellow with an ugly face a daughter and a pretty son   hastings we have not seen the gentleman but he has the family you mention   tony the daughter a tall trapesing trolloping talkative maypole  the son a pretty wellbred agreeable youth that every body is fond of   marlow our information differs in this the daughter is said to be wellbred and beautiful the son an awkward booby reared up and spoiled at his mothers apronstring   tony hehehem  then gentlemen all i have to tell you is that you will not reach mr hardcastles house this night i believe   hastings unfortunate   tony it is a damned long dark boggy dirty dangerous way stingo tell the gentlemen the way to mr hardcastles winking upon the landlord mr hardcastles of quagmire marsh you understand me   landlord master hardcastles lockadaisy my masters youre come a deadly deal wrong when you came to the bottom of the hill you should have crossed down squashlane   marlow cross down squashlane   landlord then you were to keep straight forward till you came to four roads   marlow come to where four roads meet   tony ay but you must be sure to take only one of them   marlow o sir youre facetious   tony then keeping to the right you are to go sideways till you come upon crackskull common there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel and go forward till you come to farmer murrains barn coming to the farmers barn you are to turn to the right and then to the left and then to the right about again till you find out the old mill    marlow zounds man we could as soon find out the longitude   hastings what is to be done marlow   marlow this house promises but a poor reception though perhaps the landlord can accommodate us   landlord alack master we have but one spare bed in the whole house   tony and to my knowledge that is taken up by three lodgers already after a pause in which the rest seem disconcerted i have hit it dont you think stingo our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen by the fireside with  three chairs and a bolster   hastings i hate sleeping by the fireside   marlow and i detest your three chairs and a bolster   tony you do do you  then let me see  what  if you go on a mile further to the bucks head the old bucks head on the hill one of the best inns in the whole county   hastings o ho so we have escaped an adventure for this night however   landlord apart to tony sure you bent sending them to your fathers as an inn be you   tony mum you fool you let them find that out to them you have only to keep on straight forward till you come to a large old house by the road side you will see a pair of large horns over the door that is the sign drive up the yard and call stoutly about you   hastings sir we are obliged to you the servants cannot miss the way   tony no no but i tell you though the landlord is rich and going to leave off business so he wants to be thought a gentleman saving your presence he he he he will be for giving you his company and ecod if you mind him he will persuade you that his mother was an alderman and his aunt a justice of peace   landlord a troublesome old blade to be sure but a keeps as good wines and beds as any in the whole country   marlow well if he supplies us with these we shall want no further connection we are to turn to the right did you say   tony no no straight forward i will just step myself and show you a piece of the way to the landlord mum   landlord ah bless your heart for a sweet pleasant  damned mischievous son of a whore   exeunt

whom i have advanced from the plough are to place yourself behind my chair but youre not to stand so with your hands in your pockets take your hands from your pockets roger and from your head you blockhead you see how diggory carries his hands they are a little too stiff indeed but that is no great matter   diggory ay mind how i hold them i learned to hold my hands this way when i was upon drill for the militia and so being upon drill    hardcastle you must not be so talkative diggory you must be all attention to the guests you must hear us talk and not think of talking you must see us drink and not think of drinking you must see us eat and not think of eating   diggory by the laws your worship that is parfectly unpossible whenever diggory sees yeating going forward ecod he is always wishing for a mouthful himself   hardcastle blockhead is not a bellyfull in the kitchen as good as a bellyfull in the parlour stay your stomach with that reflection   diggory ecod i thank your worship i will make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry   hardcastle diggory you are too talkative then if i happen to say a good thing or tell a good story at table you must not all burst out alaughing as if you made part of the company   diggory then ecod your worship must not tell the story of old grouse in the gunroom i cannot help laughing at that  he he he  for the soul of me we have laughed at that these twenty years  ha ha ha   hardcastle ha ha ha the story is a good one well honest diggory you may laugh at that  but still remember to be attentive suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine how will you behave a glass of wine sir if you please to diggory  eh why dont you move   diggory ecod your worship i never have courage till i see the eatables and drinkables brought upo the table and then i am as bauld as a lion   hardcastle what will no body move   first servant i am not to leave this pleace   second servant i am sure it is no pleace of mine   third servant nor mine for sartain   diggory wauns and i am sure it canna be mine   hardcastle you numbskulls and so while like your betters you are quarrelling for places the guests must be starved o you dunces i find i must begin all over again  but dont i hear a coach drive into the yard to your posts you blockheads i will go in the mean time and give my old friends son a hearty reception at the gate   exit hardcastle diggory by the elevens my pleace is gone quite out of my head   roger i know that my pleace is to be every where   first servant where the devil is mine   second servant my pleace is to be no where at all and so ize go about my business   exeunt servants running about as if frighted different ways enter servant with candles showing in marlow and hastings servant welcome gentlemen very welcome this way   hastings after the disappointments of the day welcome once more charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable   marlow the usual fate of a large mansion having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn   hastings as you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries i have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece though not actually put in the bill inflame a reckoning confoundedly   marlow travelers george must pay in all places the only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved   hastings you have lived pretty much among them in truth i have been often surprised that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance   marlow the englishmans malady but tell me george where could i have learned that assurance you talk of my life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence i dont know that i was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman  except my mother  but among females of another class you know    hastings ay among them you are impudent enough of all conscience   marlow they are of us you know   hastings but in the company of women of reputation i never saw such an idiot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room   marlow why man that is because i do want to steal out of the room faith i have often formed a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate but i dont know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution an impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but i will be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence   hastings if you could but say half the fine things to them that i have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bed maker    marlow why george i cannot say fine things to them they freeze they petrify me they may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle but to me a modest woman dressed out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation   hastings ha ha ha at this rate man how can you ever expect to marry   marlow never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy if indeed like an eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured but to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of madam will you marry me no no that is strain much above me i assure you   hastings i pity you but how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father   marlow as i behave to all other ladies bow very low answer yes or no to all her demands  but for the rest i dont think i shall venture to look in her face till i see my fathers again   hastings i am surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover   marlow to be explicit my dear hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own miss neville loves you the family dont know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honor do the rest   hastings my dear marlow but i will suppress the emotion were i a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world i would apply to for assistance but miss nevilles person is all i ask and that is mine both from her deceased fathers consent and her own inclination   marlow happy man you have talents and art to captivate any woman i am doomed to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it i despise this stammer in my address and this awkward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliners prentice or one of the dutchesses of drury lane pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us   enter hardcastle hardcastle gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome which is mr marlow sir youre heartily welcome it is not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire i like to give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate i like to see their horses and trunks taken care of   marlow aside he has got our names from the servants already to him we approve your caution and hospitality sir to hastings i have been thinking george of changing our traveling dresses in the morning i am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine   hardcastle i beg mr marlow you will use no ceremony in this house   hastings i fancy george youre right the first blow is half the battle i intend opening the campaign with the white and gold   mr hardcastle mr marlow  mr hastings  gentlemen  pray be under no constraint in this house this is libertyhall gentlemen you may do just as you please here   marlow yet george if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it is over i think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat   hardcastle your talking of a retreat mr marlow puts me in mind of the duke of marlborough when we went to besiege denain he first summoned the garrison   marlow dont you think the ventre dor waistcoat will do with the plain brown   hardcastle he first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men    hastings i think not brown and yellow mix but very poorly   hardcastle i say gentlemen as i was telling you he summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men    marlow the girls like finery   hardcastle which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war now says the duke of marlborough to george brooks that stood next to him  you must have heard of george brooks i will pawn my dukedom says he but i take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood so    marlow what my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigor   hardcastle punch sir aside this is the most unaccountable kind of modesty i ever met with   marlow yes sir punch a glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable this is libertyhall you know   hardcastle here is cup sir   marlow aside so this fellow in his libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases   hardcastle taking the cup i hope you will find it to your mind i have prepared it with my own hands and i believe you will own the ingredients are tolerable will you be so good as to pledge me sir here mr marlow here is to our better acquaintance  drinks marlow aside a very impudent fellow this but he is a character and i will humor him a little sir my service to you  drinks hastings aside i see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that he is an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman   marlow from the excellence of your cup my old friend i suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country warm work now and then at elections i suppose   hardcastle no sir i have long given that work over since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there is no business for us that sell ale   hastings so then you have no turn for politics i find   hardcastle not in the least there was a time indeed i fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better i left it to mend itself since that i no more trouble my head about heyder ally or ally cawn than about ally croaker sir my service to you   hastings so that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it   hardcastle i do stir about a great deal that is certain half the differences

soon hear of his mother being a justice of peace but let us hear the bill of fare   marlow perusing what is here for the first course for the second course for the desert the devil sir do you think we have brought down the whole joiners company or the corporation of bedford to eat up such a supper two or three little things clean and comfortable will do   hastings but let us hear it   marlow reading for the first course at the top a pig and pruin sauce   hastings damn your pig i say   marlow and damn your pruin sauce say i   hardcastle and yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with

house as at a green and yellow dinner at the french ambassadors table i am for plain eating   hardcastle i am sorry gentlemen that i have nothing you like but if there be any thing you have a particular fancy to    marlow why really sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another send us what you please so much for supper and now to see that our beds are aird and properly taken care of   hardcastle i entreat you will leave all that to me you shall not stir a step   marlow leave that to you i protest sir you must excuse me i always look to these things myself   hardcastle i must insist sir you will make yourself easy on that head   marlow you see i am resolved on it aside a very troublesome fellow this as ever i met with   hardcastle

find this fellows civilities begin to grow troublesome but who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him ha what do i see miss neville by all that is happy   enter miss neville miss neville my dear hastings to what unexpected good fortune to what accident am i to ascribe this happy meeting   hastings rather let me ask the same question as i could never have hoped to meet my dearest constance at an inn   miss neville an inn sure you mistake my aunt my guardian lives here what could induce you to think this house an inn   hastings my friend mr marlow with whom i came down and i have been sent here as to an inn i assure you a young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither   miss neville certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousins tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha ha   hastings he whom your aunt intends for you he of whom i have such just apprehensions   miss neville you have nothing to fear from him i assure you you would adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me my aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest   hastings thou dear dissembler you must know my constance i have just seized this happy opportunity of my friends visit here to get admittance into the family the horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but they will soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful hastings we shall soon be landed in france where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected   miss neville i have often told you that though ready to obey you i yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance the greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the india director and chiefly consists in jewels i have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them i fancy i am very near succeeding the instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours   hastings perish the baubles your person is all i desire in the meantime my friend marlow must not be let into his mistake i know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution   miss neville but how shall we keep him in the deception miss hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive him  this this way   they confer enter marlow marlow the assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing my host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back they talk of coming to sup with us too and then i suppose we are to run the gauntlet through all the rest of the family  what have we got here    hastings my dear charles let me congratulate you  the most fortunate accident  who do you think is just alighted   marlow cannot guess   hastings our mistresses boy miss hardcastle and miss neville give me leave to introduce miss constance neville to your acquaintance happening to dine in the neighborhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here miss hardcastle has just stepped into the next room and will be back in an instant was not it lucky eh   marlow aside i have just been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment   hastings well but was not it the most fortunate thing in the world   marlow oh yes very fortunate  a most joyful encounter  but our dresses george you know are in disorder  what if we should postpone the happiness till tomorrow  tomorrow at her own house  it will be every bit as convenient  and rather more respectful  tomorrow let it be  offering to go miss neville by no means sir your ceremony will displease her the disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her   marlow o the devil how shall i support it hem hem hastings you must not go you are to assist me you know i shall be confoundedly ridiculous yet hang it i will take courage hem   hastings pshaw man it is but the first plunge and all is over she is but a woman you know   marlow and of all women she that i dread most to encounter  enter miss hardcastle as returned from walking a bonnet etc   hastings introducing them miss hardcastle mr marlow i am proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other   miss hardcastle aside now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner after a pause in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted i am glad of your safe arrival sir  i am told you had some accidents by the way   marlow only a few madam yes we had some yes madam a good many accidents but should be sorry  madam  or rather glad of any accidents  that are so agreeably concluded hem   hastings to him you never spoke better in your whole life keep it up and i will insure you the victory   miss hardcastle i am afraid you flatter sir you that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country   marlow gathering courage i have lived indeed in the world madam but i have kept very little company i have been but an observer upon life madam while others were enjoying it   miss neville but that i am told is the way to enjoy it at last   hastings to him cicero never spoke better once more and you are confirmed in assurance for ever   marlow to him hem stand by me then and when i am down throw in a word or two to set me up again   miss hardcastle an observer like you upon life were i fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve   marlow pardon me madam i was always willing to be amused the folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness   hastings to him bravo bravo never spoke so well in your whole life well miss hardcastle i see that you and mr marlow are going to be very good company i believe our being here will but embarrass the interview   marlow not in the least mr hastings we like your company of all things to him zounds george sure you will not go how can you leave us   hastings our presence will but spoil conversation so well retire to the next room to him you dont consider man that we are to manage a little teteatete of our own   exeunt miss hardcastle after a pause but you have not been wholly an observer i presume sir the ladies i should hope have employed some part of your addresses   marlow relapsing into timidity pardon me madam i  i  i  as yet have studied  only  to  deserve them   miss hardcastle and that some say is the very worst way to obtain them   marlow perhaps so madam but i love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex  but i am afraid i grow tiresome   miss hardcastle not at all sir there is nothing i like so much as grave conversation myself i could hear it for ever indeed i have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart   marlow it is  a disease  of the mind madam in the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relish  for  um  a  um   miss hardcastle i understand you sir there must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting   marlow my meaning madam but infinitely better expressed and i cannot help observing  a    miss hardcastle aside who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon some occasions to him you were going to observe sir    marlow i was observing madam  i protest madam i forget what i was going to observe   miss hardcastle aside i vow and so do i to him you were observing sir that in this age of hypocrisy something about hypocrisy sir   marlow yes madam in this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict enquiry do not  a  a  a    miss hardcastle i understand you perfectly sir   marlow aside egad and that is more than i do myself   miss hardcastle you mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practice in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it   marlow true madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms but i am sure i tire you madam   miss hardcastle not in the least sir there is something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and force  pray sir go on   marlow yes madam i was saying  that there are some occasions  when a total want of courage madam destroys all the  and puts us  upon a  a  a    miss hardcastle i agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance and betrays us when we most want to excel i beg you will proceed   marlow yes madam morally speaking madam  but i see miss neville expecting us in the next room i would not intrude for the world   miss hardcastle i protest sir i never was more agreeably entertained in all my life pray go on   marlow yes madam i was  but she beckons us to join her madam shall i do myself the honor to attend you   miss hardcastle well then i will follow   marlow aside this pretty smooth dialogue has done for me   exit miss hardcastle sola miss hardcastle ha ha ha was there ever such a sober sentimental interview i am certain he scarce looked in my face the whole time yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too he has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance if i could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that i know of a piece of service but who is that somebody  that faith is a question i can scarce answer   exit enter tony and miss neville followed by mrs hardcastle and hastings tony what do you follow me for cousin con i wonder youre not ashamed to be so very engaging   miss neville i hope cousin one may speak to ones own relations and not be to blame   tony ay but i know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it will not do i tell you cousin con it will not do so i beg you will keep your distance i want no nearer relationship   she follows coqueting him to the back scene mrs hardcastle well i vow mr hastings you are very entertaining there is nothing in the world i love to talk of so much as london and the fashions though i was never there myself   hastings never there you amaze me from your air and manner i concluded you had been bred all your life either at ranelagh st jamess or tower wharf   mrs hardcastle o sir youre only pleased to say so we country persons can have no manner at all i am in love with the town and that serves to raise me above some of our neighboring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the pantheon the grotto gardens the borough and such places where the nobility chiefly resort all i can do is to enjoy london at secondhand i take care to know every teteatete from the scandalous magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two miss rickets of crookedlane pray how do you like this head mr hastings   hastings extremely elegant and degagee upon my word madam your friseur is a frenchman i suppose   mrs hardcastle i protest i dressed it myself from a print in the ladies memorandumbook for the last year   hastings indeed such a head in a sidebox at the playhouse would draw as many gazers as my lady mayress at a city ball   mrs hardcastle i vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd   hastings but that can never be your case madam in any dress  bowing mrs hardcastle yet what signifies my dressing when i have such a piece of antiquity by my side as mr hardcastle all i can say will never argue down a single button from his clothes i have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaster it over like my lord pately with powder   hastings you are right madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old   mrs hardcastle but what do you think his answer was why with his usual gothic vivacity he said i only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tete for my own wearing   hastings intolerable at your age you may wear what you please and it must become you   mrs hardcastle pray mr hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town   hastings some time ago forty was all the mode but i am told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter   mrs hardcastle seriously then i shall be too young for the fashion   hastings no lady begins now to put on jewels till she is past forty for instance miss there in a polite circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers   mrs hardcastle and yet mrs niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all   hastings your niece is she and that young gentleman a brother of yours i should presume   mrs hardcastle my son sir they are contracted to each other observe their little sports they fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already to them well tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin constance this evening   tony i have been saying no soft things but that it is very hard to be followed about so ecod i have not a place in the house now that is left to myself but the stable   mrs hardcastle never mind him con my dear he is in another story behind your back   miss neville there is something generous in my cousins manner he falls out before faces to be forgiven in private   tony that is a damned confounded  crack   mrs hardcastle ah he is a sly one dont you think they are like each other about the mouth mr hastings the blenkinsop mouth to a t they are of a size too back to back my pretties

education i that have rocked you in your cradle and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon did not i work that waistcoat to make you genteel did not i prescribe for you every day and weep while the receipt was operating   tony ecod you had reason to weep for you have been dosing me ever since i was born i have gone through every receipt in the complete huswife ten times over and you have thoughts of coursing me through quincy next spring but ecod i tell you i will not be made a fool of no longer   mrs hardcastle was not it all for your good viper was not it all for your good   tony i wish you would let me and my good alone then snubbing this way when i am in spirits if i am to have any good let it come of itself not to keep dinging it dinging it into one so   mrs hardcastle that is false i never see you when youre in spirits no tony you then go to the alehouse or kennel i am never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster   tony ecod mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two   mrs hardcastle was ever the like but i see he wants to break my heart i see he does   hastings dear madam permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little i am certain i can persuade him to his duty   mrs hardcastle well i must retire come constance my love you see mr hastings the wretchedness of my situation was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy   exeunt mrs hardcastle and miss neville hastings tony tony singing there was a young man riding by and fain would have his will rang do didlo dee dont mind her let her cry it is the comfort of her heart i have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry   hastings then youre no friend to the ladies i find my pretty young gentleman   tony that is as i find um   hastings not to her of your mothers choosing i dare answer and yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl   tony that is because you dont know her as well as i ecod i know every inch about her and there is not a more bitter cantanckerous toad in all christendom   hastings aside pretty encouragement this for a lover   tony i have seen her since the height of that she has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first days breaking   hastings to me she appears sensible and silent   tony ay before company but when she is with her playmates she is as loud as a hog in a gate   hastings but there is a meek modesty about her that charms me   tony yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and youre flung in a ditch   hastings well but you must allow her a little beauty  yes you must allow her some beauty   tony bandbox she is all a made up thing mun ah could you but see bet bouncer of these parts you might then talk of beauty ecod she has two eyes as black as sloes and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion she would make two of she   hastings well what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands   tony anon   hastings would you thank him that would take miss neville and leave you to happiness and your dear betsy   tony ay but where is there such a friend for who would take her   hastings i am he if you but assist me i will engage to whip her off to france and you shall never hear more of her   tony assist you ecod i will to the last drop of my blood i will clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling and may be get you a part of her fortin beside in jewels that you little dream of   hastings my dear squire this looks like a lad of spirit   tony come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me singing we are the boys that fears no noise where the thundering cannons roar   exeunt end of second act act iii enter hardcastle solus hardcastle what could my old friend sir charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town to me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue he has taken possession of the easy chair by the fireside already he took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of i am desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter  she will certainly be shocked at it   enter miss hardcastle plainly dressed hardcastle well my kate i see you have changed your dress as i bid you and yet i believe there was no great occasion   miss hardcastle i find such a pleasure sir in obeying your commands that i take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety   hardcastle and yet kate i sometimes give you some cause particularly when i recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover today   miss hardcastle you taught me to expect something extraordinary and i find the original exceeds the description   hardcastle i was never so surprised in my life he has quite confounded all my faculties   miss hardcastle i never saw any thing like it and a man of the world too   hardcastle ay he learned it all abroad  what a fool was i to think a young man could learn modesty by traveling he might as soon learn wit at a masquerade   miss hardcastle it seems all natural to him   hardcastle a good deal assisted by bad company and a french dancing master   miss hardcastle sure you mistake papa a french dancing master could never have taught him that timid look  that awkward address  that bashful manner    hardcastle whose look whose manner child   miss hardcastle mr marlows his meanvaise loute his timidity struck me at the first sight   hardcastle then your first sight deceived you for i think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses   miss hardcastle sure sir you rally i never saw any one so modest   hardcastle and can you be serious i never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since i was born bully dawson was but a fool to him   miss hardcastle surprising he met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground   hardcastle he met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again   miss hardcastle he treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and madam i would not for the world detain you   hardcastle he spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before asked twenty questions and never waited for an answer interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun and when i was in my best story of the duke of marlborough and prince eugene he asked if i had not a good hand at making punch yes kate he asked your father if he was a maker of punch   miss hardcastle one of us must certainly be mistaken   hardcastle if he be what he has shown himself i am determined he shall never have my consent   miss hardcastle and if he be the sullen thing i take him he shall never have mine   hardcastle in one thing then we are agreed  to reject him   miss hardcastle yes but upon conditions for if you should find him less impudent and i more presuming if you find him more respectful and i more importunate  i dont know  the fellow is well enough for a man  certainly we dont meet many such at a horse race in the country   hardcastle if we should find him so  but that is impossible the first appearance has done my business i am seldom deceived in that   miss hardcastle and yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance   hardcastle ay when a girl finds a fellows outside to her taste she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture with her a smooth face stands for good sense and a genteel figure for every virtue   miss hardcastle i hope sir a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense will not end with a sneer at my understanding   hardcastle pardon me kate but if young mr brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions he may please us both perhaps   miss hardcastle and as one of us must be mistaken what if we go to make further discoveries   hardcastle agreed but depend on it i am in the right   miss hardcastle and depend on it i am not much in the wrong   exeunt enter tony running in with a casket tony ecod i have got them here they are my cousin cons necklaces bobs and all my mother shall not cheat the poor souls out of their

procured them by the rule of thumb if i had not a key to every drawer in mothers bureau how could i go to the alehouse so often as i do an honest man may rob himself of his own at any time   hastings thousands do it every day but to be plain with you miss neville is endeavoring to procure them from her aunt this very instant if she succeeds it will be the most delicate way at least of obtaining them   tony well keep them till you know how it will be but i know how it will be well enough she would as soon part with the only sound tooth in her head   hastings but i dread the effects of her resentment when she finds she has lost them   tony never you mind her resentment leave me to manage that i dont value her resentment the bounce of a cracker zounds here they are morris prance   exit

hardcastle and are you sure he does not remember my face or person   maid certain of it   miss hardcastle i vow i thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me   maid but what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake   miss hardcastle in the first place i shall be seen and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market then i shall perhaps make an acquaintance and that is no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex but my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giants force before i offer to combat   maid but are you sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person   miss hardcastle never fear me i think i have got the true bar cant  did your honor

call for in these parts french i suppose we keep no french wines here sir   marlow of true english growth i assure you   miss hardcastle then it is odd i should not know it we brew all sorts of wines

my age they say women and music should never be dated   marlow to guess at this distance you cannot be much above forty approaching yet nearer i dont think so much approaching by coming close to some women they look younger still but when we come very close indeed attempting to kiss her   miss hardcastle pray sir keep your distance one would think you wanted to know ones age as they do horses by mark of mouth   marlow i protest child you use me extremely ill if you keep me at this distance how is it possible you and i can be ever acquainted   miss hardcastle and who wants to be acquainted with you i want no such acquaintance not i i am sure you did not treat miss hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner i will warrant me before her you looked dashed and kept bowing to the ground and talked for all the world as if you was before a justice of peace   marlow aside egad she has hit it sure enough to her in awe of her child ha ha ha a mere awkward squinting

the modest man i first took him for you will be convinced of it as well as i   hardcastle by the hand of my body i believe his impudence is infectious didnt i see him seize your hand didnt i see him hawl you about like a milk maid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth   miss hardcastle but if i shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age i hope you will forgive him   hardcastle the girl would actually make one run mad i tell you i will not be convinced i am convinced he has scarcely been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives you may like his impudence and call it modesty but my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications   miss hardcastle sir i ask but this night to convince you   hardcastle you shall not have half the time for i have thoughts of turning him out this very hour   miss hardcastle give me that hour then and i hope to satisfy you   hardcastle well an hour let it be then but i will have no trifling with your father all fair and open do you mind me   miss hardcastle i hope sir you have ever found that i

your honor   marlow she said she would keep it safe did she   servant yes she said she would keep it safe enough she asked me how i came by it and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself   exit servant marlow ha ha ha they are safe however what an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst this little barmaid though runs in my head most strangely and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family she is mine she must be mine or i am greatly mistaken   enter hastings hastings bless me i quite forgot to tell her that i intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden marlow here and in spirits too   marlow give me joy george crown me shadow me with laurels well george after all we modest fellows dont want for success among the women   hastings some women you mean but what success has your honors modesty been crowned with now that it grows so insolent upon us   marlow didnt you see the tempting brisk lovely little thing that runs about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle   hastings well and what then   marlow she is mine you rogue you such fire such motion such eyes such lips  but egad she would not let me kiss them though   hastings but are you so sure so very sure of her   marlow why man she talked of showing me her work abovestairs and i am to improve the pattern   hastings but how can you charles go about to rob a woman of her honor   marlow pshaw pshaw we all know the honor of the barmaid of an inn i dont intend to rob her take my word for it there is nothing in this house i shall not honestly pay for   hastings i believe the girl has virtue   marlow and if she has i should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it   hastings you have taken care i hope of the casket i sent you to lock up it is in safety   marlow yes yes it is safe enough i have taken care of it but how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor a place of safety ah numbskull i have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourself  i have    hastings what   marlow i have sent it to the landlady to keep for you   hastings to the landlady   marlow the landlady   hastings you did   marlow i did she is to be answerable for its forthcoming you know   hastings yes she will bring it forth with a witness   marlow was not i right i believe you will allow that i acted prudently upon this occasion   hastings aside he must not see my uneasiness   marlow you seem a little disconcerted though methinks sure nothing has happened   hastings no nothing never was in better spirits in all my life and so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge   marlow rather too readily for she not only kept the casket but through her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too ha ha ha   hastings he he he they are safe however   marlow as a guinea in a misers purse   hastings aside so now all hopes of fortune are at an end and we must set off without

house i assure you   marlow i protest my very good sir that is no fault of mine if they dont drink as they ought they are to blame i ordered them not to spare the cellar i did i assure you to the side scene here let one of my servants come up to him my positive directions were that as i did not drink myself they should make up for my deficiencies below   hardcastle then they had your orders for

slumbers after a hearty meal   marlow zounds bring me my bill i say and let us hear no more on it   hardcastle young man young man from your fathers letter to me i was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now i find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it   exit marlow how is this sure i have not mistaken the house every thing looks like an inn the servants cry coming the attendance is awkward the barmaid too to attend us but she is here and will further inform me whither so fast child a word with you   enter miss hardcastle miss hardcastle let it be short then i am in a hurry aside i believe he begins to find out his mistake but its too soon quite to undeceive him   marlow pray child answer me one question what are you and what may your business in this house be   miss hardcastle a relation of the family sir   marlow what a poor relation   miss hardcastle yes sir a poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them   marlow that is you act as the barmaid of this inn   miss hardcastle inn o law  what brought that in your head one of the best families in the county keep an inn ha ha ha old mr hardcastles house an inn   marlow mr hardcastles house is this house mr hardcastles house child   miss hardcastle ay sure whose else should it be   marlow so then all is out and i have been damnably imposed on o confound my stupid head i shall be laughed at over the whole town i shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops the dullissimo maccaroni to mistake this house of all others for an inn and my fathers old friend for an innkeeper what a swaggering puppy must he take me for what a silly puppy do i find myself there again may i be hanged my dear but i mistook you for the barmaid   miss hardcastle dear me dear me i am sure there is nothing in my behavour to put me upon a level with one of that stamp   marlow nothing my dear nothing but i was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber my stupidity saw every thing the wrong way i mistook your assiduity for assurance and your simplicity for allurement but its over  this house i no more show my face in   miss hardcastle i hope sir i have done nothing to disoblige you i am sure i should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many civil things to me i am sure i should be sorry pretending to cry if he left the family upon my account i am sure i should be sorry people said any thing amiss since i have no fortune but my character   marlow aside by heaven she weeps this is the first mark of tenderness i ever had from a modest woman and it touches me to her excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family i leave with reluctance but to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education make an honorable connection impossible and i can never harbor a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honor or bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely   miss hardcastle aside generous man i now begin to admire him to him but i am sure my family is as good as miss hardcastles and though i am poor that is no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment i never thought that it was bad to want fortune   marlow and why now my pretty simplicity   miss hardcastle because it puts me at a distance from one that if i had a thousand pound i would give it all to   marlow aside this simplicity bewitches me so that if i stay i am undone i must make one bold effort and leave her to her your partiality in my favor my dear touches me most sensibly and were i to live for myself alone i could easily fix my choice but i owe too much to the opinion of the world too much to the authority of a father so that  i can scarcely speak it  it affects me farewell   exit miss hardcastle i never knew half his merit till now he shall not go if i have power or art to detain him i will still preserve the character in which i stooped to conquer but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution   exit enter tony miss neville tony ay you may steal for yourselves the next time i have done my duty she has got the jewels again that is a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants   miss neville but my dear cousin sure you will not forsake us in this distress if she in the least suspects that i am going off i shall certainly be locked up or sent to my aunt pedigrees which is ten times worse   tony to be sure aunts of all kinds are damned bad things but what can i do i have got you a pair of horses that will fly like whistlejacket and i am sure you cannot say but i have courted you nicely before her face here she comes we must court a bit or two more for fear she should suspect us   they retire and seem to fondle enter mrs hardcastle mrs hardcastle well i was greatly fluttered to be sure but my son tells me it was all a mistake of the servants i shall not be easy however till they are fairly married and then let her keep her own fortune but what do i see fondling together as i am alive i never saw tony so sprightly before ah have i caught you my pretty doves what billing exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs ah   tony as for murmurs mother we grumble a little now and then to be sure but there is no love lost between us   mrs hardcastle a mere sprinkling tony upon the flame only to make it burn brighter   miss neville cousin tony promises to give us more of his company at home indeed he shall not leave us any more it will not leave us cousin tony will it   tony o it is a pretty creature no i would sooner leave my horse in a pound than leave you when you smile upon one so your laugh makes you so becoming   miss neville agreeable cousin who can help admiring that natural humor that pleasant broad red thoughtless patting his cheek ah it is a bold face   mrs hardcastle pretty innocence   tony i am sure i always loved cousin cons hazle eyes and her pretty long fingers that she twists this way and that over the haspicholls like a parcel of bobbins   mrs

such handles and shanks and dashes that one can scarce tell the head from the tail to anthony lumpkin esquire it is very odd i can read the outside of my letters where my own name is well enough but when i come to open it it is all  buzz that is hard very hard for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence   mrs hardcastle ha ha ha very well very well and so my son was too hard for the philosopher   miss neville yes madam but you must hear the rest madam a little more this way or he may hear us you will hear how he puzzled him again   mrs hardcastle he seems strangely puzzled now himself methinks   tony still gazing a damned up and down hand as if it was disguised in liquor reading dear sir ay that is that then there is an m and a t and an s but whether the next be an izzard or an r confound me i cannot tell   mrs hardcastle what is that my dear can i give you any assistance   miss neville pray aunt let me read it no body reads a cramp hand better than i twitching the letter from her do you know who it is from   tony cannot tell except from dick ginger the feeder   miss neville ay so it is pretending to read dear squire hoping that youre in health as i am at this present the gentlemen of the shake bag club has cut the gentlemen of goosegreen quite out of feather the odds  um  odd battle  um  long fighting  um here here it is all about cocks and fighting it is of no consequence here put it up put it up  thrusting the crumpled letter upon him tony but i tell you miss it is of all the consequence in the world i would not lose the rest of it for a guinea here mother do you make it out of no consequence  giving mrs hardcastle the letter mrs hardcastle how is this reads dear squire i am now waiting for miss neville with a postchaise and pair at

mother will otherwise suspect us yours hastings grant me patience i shall run distracted my rage choaks me   miss neville i hope madam you will suspend your resentment for a few moments and not impute to me any impertinence or sinister design that belongs to another   mrs hardcastle curtesying very low fine spoken madam you are most miraculously polite and engaging and quite the very pink of curtesy and circumspection madam changing her tone and you you great illfashioned oaf with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth shut were you too joined against me but i will defeat all your plots in a moment as for you madam since you have got a pair of fresh horses ready it would be cruel to disappoint them so if you please instead of running away with your spark prepare this very moment to

enter sir charles and hardcastle hardcastle ha ha ha the peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands   sir charles and the reserve with which i suppose he treated all your advances

spirits to think of any thing but joy yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and though my daughters fortune is but small    sir charles why dick will you talk of fortune to me my son is possessed of more than a competence already and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and increase it if they like each other as you say they do    hardcastle if man i tell you they do like each other my daughter as good as told me so   sir charles but girls are apt to flatter themselves you know   hardcastle i saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your iffs i warrant him   enter marlow marlow i come sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct i can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion   hardcastle tut boy a trifle you take it too gravely an hour or twos laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again she will never like you the worse for it   marlow sir i shall be always proud of her approbation   hardcastle approbation is but a cold word mr marlow if i am not deceived you have something more than approbation thereabouts you take me   marlow really sir i have not that happiness   hardcastle come boy i am an old fellow and know what is what as well as you that are younger i know what has past between you but mum   marlow sure sir nothing has past between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on here is you dont think sir that my impudence has been past upon all the rest of the family   miss hardcastle impudence no i dont say that  not quite impudence  though girls like to be played with and rumpled a little too sometimes but she has told no tales i assure you   marlow i never gave her the slightest cause   hardcastle well well i like modesty in its place well enough but this is overacting young gentleman you may be open your father and i will like you the better for it   marlow may i die sir if i ever    hardcastle i tell you she dont dislike you and as i am sure you like her    marlow dear sir  i protest sir    hardcastle i see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as

that is just and true i never gave miss hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection we had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting   hardcastle aside this fellows formal modest impudence is beyond bearing   sir charles and you never grasped her hand or made any protestations   marlow as heaven is my witness i came down in obedience to your commands i saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance i hope you will exact no further proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which i suffer so many mortifications   exit sir charles i am astonished at the air of sincerity with which he parted   hardcastle and i am astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance   sir charles i dare pledge my life and honor upon his truth   hardcastle here comes my daughter and i would stake my happiness upon her veracity   enter miss hardcastle hardcastle kate come hither child answer us sincerely and without reserve has mr marlow made you any professions of love and affection   miss hardcastle the question is very abrupt sir but since you require unreserved sincerity i think he has   hardcastle to sir charles you see   sir charles and pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview   miss hardcastle yes sir several   hardcastle to sir charles you see   sir charles but did he profess any attachment   miss hardcastle a lasting one   sir charles did he talk of love   miss hardcastle much sir   sir charles amazing and all this formally   miss hardcastle formally   hardcastle now my friend i hope you are satisfied   sir charles and how did he behave madam   miss hardcastle as most professed admirers do said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture   sir charles now i am perfectly convinced indeed i know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive this forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him and i am confident he never sat for the picture   miss hardcastle then what sir if i should convince you to your face of my sincerity if you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person   sir charles agreed and if i find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end   exit miss hardcastle and if you dont find him what i describe  i fear my happiness must never have a beginning   exeunt scene changes

your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all this riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome it has shook me worse than the basket of a stagecoach   hastings but how where did you leave your fellow travelers are they in safety are they housed   tony five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad driving the poor beasts have smoaked for it rabbet me but i would rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment   hastings well but where have you left the ladies i die with impatience   tony left them why where should i leave them but where i found them   hastings this is a riddle   tony riddle me this then what is that goes round the house and round the house and never touches the house   hastings i am still astray   tony why that is it mon i have led them astray by jingo there is not a pond or slough within five miles of the place but they can tell the taste of   hastings ha ha ha i understand you took them in a round while they supposed themselves going forward and so you have at last brought them home again   tony you shall hear i first took them down featherbedlane where we stuck fast in the mud i then rattled them crack over the stones of upanddown hill  i then introduced them to the gibbet on heavytree heath and from that with a circumbendibus i fairly lodged them in the horsepond at the bottom of the garden   hastings but no accident i hope   tony no no only mother is confoundedly frightened she thinks herself forty miles off she is sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl so if your own horses be ready you may whip off with cousin and i will be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you   hastings my dear friend how can i be grateful   tony ay now its dear friend noble squire just now it was all idiot cub and run me through the guts damn your way of fighting i say after we take a knock in this part of the country we kiss and be friends but if you had run me through the guts then i should be dead and you might go kiss the hangman   hastings the rebuke is just but i must hasten to relieve miss neville if you keep the old lady employed i promise to take care of the young one   exit hastings tony never fear me here she comes vanish she is got from the pond and draggled up to the waist like a mermaid   enter mrs hardcastle mrs hardcastle oh tony i am killed shook

little resolution and we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity   miss neville i find it impossible my spirits are so sunk with the agitations i have suffered that i am unable to face any new danger two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness   hastings such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy let us fly my charmer let us date our happiness from this very moment perish fortune love and content will increase what we possess beyond a monarchs revenue let me prevail   miss neville no mr hastings no prudence once more comes to my relief and i will obey its dictates in the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance i am resolved to apply to mr hardcastles compassion and justice for redress   hastings but though he had the will he has not the power to relieve you   miss neville but he has influence and upon that i am resolved to rely   hastings i have no hopes but since you persist i must reluctantly obey you   exeunt scene changes enter sir charles and miss hardcastle sir charles what a situation am i in if what you say appears i shall then find a guilty son if what he says be true i shall then lose one that of all others i most wished for a daughter   miss hardcastle i am proud of your approbation and to show i merit it if you place yourselves as i directed you shall hear his explicit declaration but he comes   sir charles i will to your father and keep him to the appointment   exit sir charles enter marlow marlow though prepared for setting out i come once more to take leave nor did i till this moment know the pain i feel in the separation   miss hardcastle in her own natural manner i believe these sufferings cannot be very great sir which you can so easily remove a day or two longer perhaps might lessen your uneasiness by showing the little value of what you now think proper to regret   marlow aside this girl every moment improves upon me to her it must not be madam i have already trifled too long with my heart my very pride begins to submit to my passion the disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painful effort of resolution   miss hardcastle then go sir i will urge nothing more to detain you though my family be as good as here is you came down to visit and my education i hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence i must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit i must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fixed on fortune   enter hardcastle and sir charles from behind sir charles here behind this screen   hardcastle ay ay make no noise i will engage my kate covers him with confusion at last   marlow by heavens madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion but every moment that i converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression what at first seemed rustic plainness now appears refined simplicity what seemed forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue   sir charles what can it mean he amazes me   hardcastle i told you how it would be hush   marlow i am now determined to stay madam and i have too good an opinion of my fathers discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation   miss hardcastle no mr marlow i will not cannot detain you do you think i could suffer a connection in which there is the smallest room for repentance do you think i would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion do you think i could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours   marlow by all that is good i can have no happiness but what is in your power to grant me nor shall i ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before i will stay even contrary to your wishes and though you should persist to shun me i will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct   miss hardcastle sir i must entreat you will desist as our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference i might have given an hour or two to levity but feriously mr marlow do you think i could ever submit to a connection where i must appear mercenary and you imprudent do you think i could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer   marlow kneeling does this look like security does this look like confidence no madam every moment that shows me your merit only serves to increase my diffidence and confusion here let me continue    sir charles i can hold it no longer charles charles how have thou deceived me is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation   hardcastle your cold contempt your formal interview what have you to say now   marlow that i am all amazement what can it mean   hardcastle it means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure that you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter   marlow daughter  this lady your daughter   hardcastle yes sir my only daughter my kate whose else should she be   marlow oh the devil   miss hardcastle yes sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for curtesying she that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha   marlow zounds there is no bearing this it is worse than death   miss hardcastle in which of your characters sir will you give us leave to address you as the faultering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with mrs mantrap and old miss biddy buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha   marlow o curse on my noisy head i never attempted to be impudent yet that i was not taken down i must be gone   hardcastle by the hand of my body but you shall not i see it was all a mistake and i am rejoiced to

modest visitor here   sir charles who my honest george hastings as worthy a fellow as lives and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice   hardcastle then by the hand of my body i am proud of the connection   mrs hardcastle well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss   hardcastle sure dorothy you would not be so mercenary   mrs hardcastle ay that is my affair not yours but you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal   hardcastle ay but he is not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal   enter hastings and miss neville mrs hardcastle aside what returned so soon i begin not to like it   hastings to hardcastle for my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment we are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity by her fathers consent i first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty   miss neville since his death i have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression in an hour of levity i was ready even to give up my fortune to secure my choice but i am now recovered from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connection   mrs hardcastle pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel   hardcastle be it what it will i am glad they are come back to reclaim their due come hither tony boy do you refuse this ladys hand whom i now offer you   tony what signifies my refusing you know i cannot refuse her till i am of age father   hardcastle while i thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement i concurred with your mothers desire to keep it secret but since i find she turns it to a wrong use i must now declare you have been of age these three months   tony of age am i of age father   hardcastle above three months   tony then you will see
