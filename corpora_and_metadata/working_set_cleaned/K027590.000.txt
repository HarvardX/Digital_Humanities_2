a whipping for the welsh parson  being a comment on the rev mr evan lloyds epistle to david garrick esquire by scriblerius flagellarius  to which is superadded the parsons text  vapula verbereum caput plaut asin et per london printed for t evans in paternoster row  mdcclxxiii  preface it is now full seven months since the following curious epistle was advertised in the public papers and its speedy publication promised we were then told also that the occasion of it was a late infamous attack on the character of the gentleman to whom it is addressed see morning chronicle of july         the length of time which has since elapsed and that gentlemans giving up his own cause naturally gave room to imagine that the delivery of a mountain so long in labor with a mouse would be thought ridiculously superfluous the ingenious author however of the powers of the pen  the curate  methodist and conversation price two and sixpence each could not resist the powerful temptation of adding another twoshilling sprig to his former bays hence after a truce declared and the field of battle forsaken steps forth this reverend champion to renew the fight and slay the slain unhappily for him the disturbance he has thus given their ashes seems to have provoked their ghosts to seek an avenger in the person of that learned commentator scriblerius flagellarius who makes no other apology for the insignificancy of his comment than the inanity of the text taking refuge under the old adage ex nihilo nihil fit some apology indeed may seem necessary for supperadding a copy of the parsons text whole and entire and would be really so were it the property of the publisher but as we find the original is printed on the authors own account and he might suffer more in his reputation by our printing only mutilated extracts of his performance than he would in his pocket from our printing the whole we thought ourselves bound in justice to prefer his fame as an author to his profit as a bookseller at the same time we held it incumbent on us in justice to the public to set a less price on the text and comment together than he has done on the text alone because admitting as above the inanity or nothingness of both we know as adepts in algebra that negative quantities added together produce a sum so much the less in value as the coefficients increase in number modesty however having induced us to value our comment at but half the price of the text we have stated the value of both together at a fourth less agreeable to calculation for    x added to  x is  to    x  to

shine finis comment the author not having given us the argument of his epistle we shall begin the business of his scholiast by endeavoring to make it out as well as we can for the convenience of the prosaic reader  argument of the text as in the physical or natural world the sun cherishes alike both weeds and flowers so in the world of letters the sun of learning shines alike both on the scholar and the dunce on the genius and the blockhead from the beginning to line    many and great are the evils which have followed this promiscuous dispensation of natural and literary blessings l    to    according to the wisdom of ages and the laws of nature it is a received maxim that opposites attract opposites as fairnes foulness and so forth the depth of heavens design in this is left to be sounded by the metaphysicians l        facts alone are abided by and the wasps worms and flies that prey upon our peaches and pears are shown to be a natural evil and a vile blunder in the system of providence l        the world of letters is still more preposterous than that of nature dunces and blockheads constantly hunting down men of parts and genius l    to    thus that old grub and ministerial pensioner the author of the false alarm hight dr sam johnson endeavored to hunt down the wellknown junius l      00 and thus must thou immortal roscius favored by all the nine expect to be hunted up and down nor can thou repine while revelling in the embraces of the coy maids at being subject to the hissing of the snakes of envy l  00      while envys fever burns the raving bard bavius with venomed heart paints the vilest crime in vilest words in the vilest rhyme that is the author of leapfrog hight  shirley esquire tosses up st pauls and sets it topsyturvey on its golden cross it is thus he turns every thing arseyversey even putting the allseeing eye of heaven into the blind eye of a glowworms tail it is thus he makes bishop lowth a blockhead  dan shakespeare unnatural  orator pit a stammerer and thou great roscius a toothess old oysterwoman l          would thou be pleased that when a future plutarch probably meaning parson w  s author of as curious a prose epistle to d g esquire shall usher thee into the temple of fame he should damn thy reputation by placing bavius author of leapfrog in the next niche as thy friend l          and yet candor will excuse even bavius upon coolly reflecting on the present strange topseyturvey state of nature for though formerly bulls butted with their horns and asses kicked with their heels man bird and beast each following the dictates of nature it is now quite otherwise bavius the ass instead of lifting his heel kicking us with his head l          yet thou immaculate roscius needst fear nothing not even a legion of devils with their captain satan or their lieutenantcaptain mendax at their head being possessed of conscious innocence and the impenetrable shield of virtue l       0  thou have nothing to do but to listen to my numerous melodious and nectareous verse which flows to give lethaean rest to that perturbed spirit in thy breast which secured by virtue and innocence does nothing but laugh and sing while guilt can never be lulled to rest though by a welsh harp strung with the harmonious locks of apollo l  0       it is pleasant to see repulsed the feeble attacks of that grubstreetlaureate zoilus author of loveinthesuds hight dr kenrick monarch of fleetditch and usurper of the throne of cloacina whose cleanly revenues he receives like another roman emperor from the hands of scavengers           postscript thou art the sun to whom the fly was once sent ambassador from the insects who could not bear thy meridian glory thou scorchest the eyes of literary gnats theatric beetles and bedoctord bats darklings obscene dim children of the night who club their malice to execrate thy light being unable to shine till thou art retired behind the scenes in thetis lap to rest l     ad ult    line  0 the curiosa felicitas or happy choice of words and chastity of metaphor for which our reverend author is so eminently distinguished begin already to manifest themselves so that bright sun prime nourisher of wit which burns in burke in lyttelton and pit this is the first time we believe that the flaming brightness or burning heat of the sun has been mistaken for that genial warmth by which it nourishes either fruits or flowers  it is with peculiar propriety also that our reverend bard has particularized the great patriot mr pit as one of those on whom the sun of learning has so beneficently shone the profundity of this great patriots erudition indeed appears to singular advantage in his literary productions which to use the just distinction of lord pomfret are written in the liberal style of a gentleman and not with that grammatic propriety which betrays the vulgar pen of a literary mechanic  line    what a pity to be sure it is a great evil that the sun shines alike on the wise and the foolish on the just and the unjust it is to be hoped the next time our wise parson gets into the pulpit he will expunge this blunder from the sacred text and correct such a gross error in the laws of nature  line    in what book of proverbs or by what law of nature the bard has made this discovery we are at a loss to guess aristotle in his ethics tells us semper similem ducit deus ad similem and again to use his own words  in the proverbial sayings of all ages and countries we shall find also that  like loves like birds of a feather flock together etc fairness and foulness therefore are repulsive and not attractive things homogeneous only attracting each other agreeably to the true system of the newtonian philosophy the truth of the matter seems to be this the parson had somewhere read envy will merit as its shade pursue but then the poet adds it like a shadow proves the substance true because there can be no shadow without a substance but then our ingenious master of arts forgot that the shadow bears a resemblance to the substance and does not differ from it as foul does from fair as this divine poet or rather poetical divine has above so roundly asserted  line    what elegance of imagery do we find in this description of pomona fruitful mother autumns queen represented here as spreading her vegetable petticoats the vine or the figleaf to preserve her mellow clusters from the depredation of those desperate banditti the wasps whom he satirizes so wittily and severely for their immoral and scandalous behavior in being beforehand with him in the robbery of orchards  line    we should be glad to know why our poet on whom the sun of learning has doubtless deigned to shine as well as on burke lyttelton and pit has here added the plural close common to english words to that of banditti as if its ending in s were necessary to make it plural the singular of banditti in english is bandit from the french or banditto from the italian thus milton no savage fierce bandit or mountaineer and shakespeare a roman sworder and banditto slave but perhaps our learned master of arts might by banditties mean a number of different companies or ruffian bands of banditti but a band and a bandit are different words the authors ignorance therefore is obvious the word banditti being never used as a noun of multitude in the singular number and therefore cannot be made plural like band or other english words by the usual termination in s what a pretty master of arts really friend evan you should be sent to school again to con your accidence  line    for wasps who sing  we should certainly read wasps who sting   of stinging wasps we have heard but of singing wasps never this we should have thought an error of the press but for the reason assigned in the next note  line  0 our author seems to entertain a violent resentment if not a rooted antipathy against the whole ferae naturae we should however be glad to know by whom according to his system of religion and morals they were laid under any moral obligation and to whom they are accountable the downy peach the bloomsuffused plumb that bloomsuffused is a happy epithet proclaim their wrongs with bleeding mouths though dumb from a dumb mouth must certainly proceed a silent proclamation which must of course also be just as curious as intelligible our poet seems indeed here to be as good a naturalist as he is a moralist and divine but as we scriblerius vapularius are strangers to the physical sensation and moral sentiment of vegetables we are at a loss to guess at his meaning either religious philosophical or moral  line  0 what a happy discovery and how worthy a protestant divine that the system of providence is a preposterous system it is no wonder if he found such absurdity prevail in the system of nature that he should find more in a system of art  line    this crime of being bright is certainly a very capital one though it is not likely our author will ever be found guilty of it  line    by this rhyme of offense and defense it seems as if our poet had entered into a league offensive and defensive against english versification  line    we have heard of bookworms natural and metaphorical but they are such as devour books instead of reading them as to a spelling worm we never heard of such a reptile either in the natural or literary system our authors spelling worm appears also to be at the same time a mere garden grub who cankers the laurels of the poet while he is spelling his verses  line    the chief grub having undergone its metamorphosis is now become a caterpillar we find however that his transformation is but partial he being still famed for long words and pedantry this is the first time we have known a caterpillar reproached with the use of the sesquipedalia had our poet called dr johnson the person here alluded to a caterpillar or grubworm critic the metaphor would have been preserved but he cannot be at once a human hog and a hoghorse  line    these thousand feet would be applicable enough to the critic considered as a millepedes or woodlouse instead of a worm or caterpillar though it be whimsical to think an insect should carry spurs on its feet to goad itself as the text stands however our master of arts seems so learned a naturalist as not to know a grub from an earwig  line    we shall leave the doctors cadogan hill and ingram to decide whether snails can be afflicted with the gout or not and if not to some future critic to discuss the propriety of this epithet but we must not omit to observe that for want of grammatical construction in these two lines onward he crawleth like a gouty snail cowards to fight or felons to a jail the last is downright nonsense unless the poet meant to make sense of half of it by saying he crawleth to fight cowards for which by the way he does not seem to have occasion for a thousand feet  line    we never heard that the apostle or any saint of the name of james kept his court or was surrounded with a brilliant circle at his levee our poetical parson must certainly mean therefore the brilliant circle in the drawing room or presence chamber at st jamess so that the above lines instead of running as above should be corrected and stand as under when in the brilliant circle of st jamess amelias beauties set the court in flamess   line  00 query does the poet mean that nature has given butterflies power only to stain their mealy wings or to stain any thing else with or by means of their mealy wings if the former he has written nonsense if the latter false grammar  line  0  the muses clasping the genius of roscius and his shining parnassus pride without a wasp is something beautifully metaphorical if it were but intelligible it is pity that clasp and wasp are not the best of rhimes rasp or hasp would have mended the sound and could not have marred the sense  line     this revelling in the savor of the nine must be attended also with a singular kind of beatitude especially if the maids are still so coy as to confine their savours to a simple kiss and yet this perhaps is as much as he ought to wish for since though he might possibly be able to deflower he could never satisfactorily enjoy them  line     of rosciuss swimming on a sea of glory one may form some idea by seeing the buoy at the nore ride over the waves at all times of the tide or to adapt more properly my simile to the subject by seeing the float of a fishingline dance upon the surface of the water till some gudgeon bite at the hook but what is to be understood by the tides of pleasure drowning the brim of the sea of glory we must leave to the sagacity of happier scholiasts  line     we have frequently heard that losers have leave to rail but why the loser is to be called a wretch because the winner is a rascal we do not comprehend but perhaps the good roscius can inform us why the author of edward the black prince has reason to rail did that conscientious manager ever pick his pocket of five hundred pounds in the same infamous manner as he did that of the author of falstaffs wedding  line     it would indeed be a wiser way than to run to hireling pleaders and pettifogging attorneys to avenge his cause by proceedings little better than the subornation of perjury  line     the raving bard here pointed at seems to be the author of a scandalous copy of verses entitled leapfrog descriptive of that dirty game published in the public ledger the rhimes of which were certainly bad enough and worse than any we have ever seen except those of our author  line     these are admirable lines and the comparison of roscius to an oysterwoman very applicable to the criticisms on that great actors playing published in the gazeteer before it became a vehicle to the puffs of the manager the prosopopeia or personification of such censures is also very beautiful it might have been mended however had the poet represented them as wasps gnats or hornets unless by moths he meant to allude to their picking holes in the managers coat  line     by no means let him not mention bavius but maevius not the irreverend author of the black prince but the reverend author of the powers of the pen qui bavium odit amet tua carmina maevi the friendship of so great a poet as our maevius must redound to the honor of roscius to the latest posterity  line     this distinction between illblood and ill will is another instance of our authors wonderful discoveries in physics and morality or rather of his dexterous use of that rhetorical trope the metaphor that bad blood should produce a strangury of wit is a circumstance we believe only known to our author unless by wit he means humor and thinks all kinds of humor alike in which case to be sure a cachectic habit arising from the abuse of the nonnaturals may preduce a strangury of wit with which master evan if he ever had any wit seems to be unhappily affected facit indignatio versus is an old adage and seems applicable to the hasty and turbulent ebullitions of ill blood our authors appear to be the effect of ill will cold blooded verses that have neither the heat of anger for their excuse on the one hand nor the warmth of good will to recommend them on the other  line     the powers of the pen are most happily exerted in this description of a costive poet who strains from hardbound brains a line a day  his pangs and throes are also so feelingly expressed that they demonstratively prove the situation to be our authors own case as indeed it is confirmed by the seven months labor of the present production  instead of no drop of wit we should read no bit of wit etc for supposing wit a fluid be it ever so brilliant and pellucid it would mix and be undiscoverable in the muddy medium of an authors inkstand besides the bit and the wit are so pit pat to our authors knack at alliteration that nostro periculo we will venture to declare the printer must have made a blunder  line     what wonder when every thing both in the natural and moral world is confessedly turned topsy turvey it is by no means more unnatural or out of character than to see a reverend divine kiss the backside of a stage player  line     this butts like baited bull is beautifully alliterative and idiomatical it is a pity it puts us so much in mind of quince and bully bottom with the  blade the bloody blameful blade that bravely broached his boiling bloody breast   line     bestowed and god make another curious rhyme indeed there is not a page in the parsons text without one or two equally curious witness skull and bull in the present an excellent rhyme  line     against the worlds malice virtue takes the field what a flowing numerous melodious and nectareous line is this it is to be equalled only by the mellifluous and elegant ease of the following  legions of devls with satan at their head line  0  true for which reason he flew like the magnanimous capt bobadil to take satisfaction at law the impenetrable buckler of conscious innocence was not proof till lined with the tough parchment of the crown office and yet conscious innocence did not choose to trust its buff doublet behind even this legal target too far  line  0  that he whoever he is for the pronoun has no antecedent in the context we say that he is of the human species cannot be admitted that he has a soul or that his soul is impressed with either the virtues or the vices of humanity we deny that by his happy talent at mimickry he takes them off most admirably cannot be disputed but we know that mimickry is characteristic of an inferior kind of animals so that we may justly say of this wonderful imitator of mankind that superior mortals admire such mimicry in human shape and praise a garrick as they praise an ape that this animal has no soul is notorious even to a proverb and we hope our parson is not like parson horn so great an infidel as to think mankind have no souls  line     how is this  what does our protestant parson believe in fate  peevish fate dissatisfied with the choicest work of nature  we were too precipitate in supposing him no atheist the parson of brentford is a novice to him in pagan mythology but perhaps he will quibble and say a fatalist is no atheist well well we will not dispute with him about words let him no longer like his brother patriot disgrace his profession but throw off his parsons gown and we will set him down for a simple heathen  line     that is the perturbed spirit which secure behind the aegis or moral shield of conscious innocence could laugh and sing at the attack of bavius and defy whole legions of devils with general satan or even his lieutenant for he had seen captains and lieutenant captains too at their head what an admirable anticlimax has our poet borrowed from tummas appletree and coster pearmain  line     this idea of a welsh harp being strung with the carrotty locks of apollo is apparently too a borrowed thought for who does not see that this device of apollos harmony lying in his hair was suggested to him by sampsons strength lying in those curling locks of which dalilah so perfidiously deprived him or perhaps our author was thinking of his crowd and the harmony which a little rosin rubs into the hair of a fiddlestick  line     what a beautiful epanalepsis is exhibited in these two lines and with what a happy homoiteleuton do they close the know and do are besides most aptly allusive to the duty of the two barristers toward their old clients do and roe of whose names this lucky rhyme so naturally reminds us  line     the poet is not quite so happy here in the use of the metaphor this distinguished pair of learned counselors are represented as two pillars the daily support of their country and at the same time enjoying its merited love the image is precisely that of a drunken patriot tottering at the door of the herculespillars or two blueposts which he hugs most cordially for fear of tumbling into the kennel the satisfaction enjoyed by pillar or post we leave to be explained by the archetypes of such proper emblems  smoothspoken mansfield not the judge of that name but the barrister who is by no means a judge with his vacant face in softening accents first shall open his case which to defend the want of merlins cunning shall be supplied by that of grimbald dunning see king arthur lately revived at drury lane theater and attend the pleadings in our courts of law and equity at westminster guildhall and lincolns end  it were difficult to exhibit a greater proof of stupidity than our welsh bard has done in taking the above passages seriously is the one counselor a fool because he is not a judge or the other a devil because he has got grimbalds unfortunate phyz and yet when the one sets up for wisdom and the other for beauty a satirist need not be over and above splenetic to call the one a booby and the other a devilish ugly fellow  as a farther specimen of the wretched iines contained in the abovementioned execrably dull poem the reader will please to take the following which its author puts into the mouth of roscius  curse on that knrck soul of spleen and whim what are my puffs and what my gains to him if poor and proud can he of right complain that wealthier men and wittier are as vain why must he hint that i am past my prime to blast my fading laurels ere their time death to my fame and what alas is worse it is death damnation to my craving purse capacious purse by plutus formed to hold the god of wealth the devil and all of gold insatiate purse that never yet ran over but swallows all and gapes like hell for more and yet alas how much the world will lie they call me miser but no miser i he brooding over his bags delighted sits and laughs to scorn the jests of envious wits if fast his doors he sets his heart at rest and dotes with rapture on his iron chest no galling papersquibs his spirits teize but even the boys may hoot him if they please he scorns the whistling of an empty name while i am torn twixt avarice and fame while i so tremblingly alive all over still bleed and agonize at every pore at every hiss am harrowed up with fear and burst with choler at a critics sneer racked by the gout and stone and struck with age prudence and ease advise to quit the stage but fame still prompts and pride can feel no pain and avarice bids me sell my soul for gain line     and hard labor it is too heaven knows and what is still worse it is likely after all to prove labourinvain  line     we shall not stand up for the cleanliness of love in the suds the washingtub though a necessary implement to cleanliness is itself a dirty subject and we think the author did right at any rate to rid his hands of it should we recur however to the newspaper altercation it gave rise to we shall find the monarch of drury lane even then more deeply entrenched on his throne of mud than his antagonist the monarch of fleetditch  since the abdication of the latter also the cleanly roscius seems to have succeeded to his rival and at present to possess the throne of both kingdoms the publication before us being the third tributary pamphlet his mock majesty has since received from his literary scavengers who keep still throwing dirt on the adversary notwithstanding the proclamation of a peace to preserve the name of these stinkpots would be doing too much honor to the wretches employed in such dirty work but lest their existence should be doubted we shall just mention their titles and authors  st the kenrickad by that literary trollop mrs brokes  d the recantation etc by that filthy yahoo paul hiffernan  dly though last not least of this goodly trio the present epistle by that forgiving and forgetting christian divine the reverend evan lloyd master of arts  we cannot help thinking that these repeated attacks on the enemy after having by agreement laid down his arms would justify him in taking them up again an authentic account of the rise progress and accommodation of the late dispute between dr k and mr g seems indeed necessary for the justification of both for though the former has fully exculpated both himself and the latter respecting the odious insinuation which various circumstances unluckily contributed to cast on him he has left it still extremely apparent that a manager of a theater may not be addicted to a particular vice and yet be notwithstanding a very great rascal  line     a beluted prince should rather seem one upon whom dirt is thrown than one accused of throwing dirt  line     it was indeed but mere talk his threats and vapouring being equally impudent and impotent so far indeed was the god of our parsons idolatry mr g from choosing to proceed in his ridiculous prosesecution of the author of loveinthesuds whose poetical attack on him was merely laughable and ludicrous that he thought proper to decline even the prosecution of the editor of leap frog in which he had been explicitly and directly charged with what the former lampoon was mistakenly and falsely supposed to insinuate  it is on the whole peculiarly modest in our welsh parson to reproach the author of loveinthesuds for being a libeller when he himself was not long since convicted in the court of kings bench and committed to the prison of that court accordingly for writing a libel a libel too of the most uncharitable and infamous kind in a man of his sacred function being levelled at his neighbor for exercising liberty of conscience in matters of religion and morality it was on this occasion he obtained from  mansfield the distinguishing appellation of the welsh parson  not that we mean whatever his lordship might do to rouse the blood of cadwallader by casting any ungentlemanlike reflection on the country of welsh bards at the same time nevertheless we have not the vanity to think we shall convict the present of being the blockhead he really is before a jury of his own countrymen the amor patriae which burns in the breast of every ancient briton will effectually prevent it as we are convinced by a story once told us by a welsh judge who after summing up the evidence against one of our authors namesakes accused of sheepstealing was answered pithily and pertinently by the foreman of the jury as follows your lortship need not taak so much trouple as we shall find the prisoner not guilty hur name is lloyd and there never was a lloyd hanged for sheeptaaking in our time nor py cot ever shall so long as we are pon the chury  line     candor obliges us to do justice to our author in answer to the impertinent censures of the monthly and critical reviews the editors of which will next month proceed to take him to task in the manner following what a wiseacre is this welsh bard to suppose that the sun shoots its rays from sirius i e the dog star to the earth when it is well known that sirius is       times farther from us than the sun and that the fixed stars shine with their own and not a borrowed light our poetical divine though born and bred on the mountains of wales whence he might be supposed to have acquired a nearer acquaintance with the heavens shows himself to be very ignorant of the science of astronomy we would therefore recommend him to the perusal of ptolomy tycho brahe kepler ricciolus cassini de la hire and above all our learned countrymen flamstead and sir isaac newton  with humble submission however to goody griffith and the hodmandod who may have read all the above authors that is the names of them in tom daviess catalogue our poet may know as much of astronomy as they do of criticism it is true that by scra as it was called by the arabs  by the greeks and sirius among the latins is usually meant a star of the first magnitude in the mouth of canis major it is of this star as the scholiasts tell us that virgil speaks in the third book of his aeneid steriles exurit sirius agros and lucan sirius exerit ignes rabidos again nothing is more common with our english poets than to tell us after the summer solstice that sirius the dog star rages but notwithstanding all this our author seems to have the advantage of the reviewers for though the best authors mean by sirius the dog star some of the worst as we are told by hesychius the lexicographer or hesychius the monk for having neither i cannot positively tell which sometimes means by sirius the sun now though our author seems to have betrayed a want of taste and discernment in adopting the unclassical practice of the corrupt ages of latinity yet we say he should not be censured for reading bad latin books instead of good ones by critics who never were capable of reading any at all good bad or indifferent  line   0 by literary gnats our author is supposed to mean those troublesome scribblers that so constantly annoy his friend roscius in the london and whitehall evening posts together with those in the few morning papers which are not under the management of the manager  line     by theatric beatles are supposed to be meant the proprietors and all the players of covent garden theater together with those even of drury lane who do not sacrifice to moloch and bow the knee to baal by bedoctord bats are evidently meant those two ignorant and illiterate blockheads doctor samuel johnson and doctor william kenrick not omitting perhaps even that mirror of doctorship scriblerius flagellarius ourself inferior to neither busbeius bentleius budeus ruaeus nor any other flagellator ancient or modern we would therefore advise this truant divine to mend his manners restrain his petulance and kiss the rod of our correction lest he provoke a heavier chastisement and from hi present inanity sink into still less than nothing beneath the weight of our castigation  finis
