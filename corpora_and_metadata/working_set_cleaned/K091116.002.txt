the recess or a tale of other times  by the author or the chapter of accidents  are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we but the penalty of adam the seasons difference vol ii  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxv  the recess or a tale of other times  the recess etc part iii from this temporary death i was at last recalled by a sound that made me wish it had been indeed eternal the voice the tremendous voice of williams of what horrors was my soul instantly susceptible what dreadful images swam before those eyes i hardly durst open fearfully at length i cast them around  i saw i had been conveyed into the great room of our recess sacred once to piety and innocence but now alas the shelter of rapine perhaps murder a number of illlooking ruffians stood ready to fulfill the worst commands of their ferocious confederate who with malignant joy contemplated two hopeless victims unpitying heaven seemed to have delivered entirely to his vengeance i gave myself up for lost  myself  i alike gave up lord leicester who thus disarmed and surrounded collected his soul in silence and resumed the majestic air which once could awe even this villain to subordination i every where perceived a variety of instruments nameless to me which i considered as the means of torture and of death and only supplicated the almighty to spare us the first since to avoid the latter i supposed a fruitless prayer  you see at last cried the exulting villain fortunes wheel has made its circle and my turn is come lord leicester  how could you hope to conquer a man whose all was courage neither sir francis nor elizabeth herself could long confine him who dares precipitate himself into the ocean in search of freedom not added he in an ironical tone that i shall fail to requite my obligation  lord leicester replied but with a look a look so superior contemptuous and collected that it wrought the rage of williams to a still higher pitch who turned toward me malignity burning in every scar of his horrid face you are welcome home fair lady continued he though your visit is an unexpected favor without the idle train too which once attended this idle favorite you see we have made a little free with your hallowed mansion but the saints take all in good part do you not enquire after your fosterfather he would tell us no tales nor will he ever now tell you one oh anthony i shuddered for thee thou venerable murdered friend in silence monster burst sorth lord leicester have thou with unexampled cruelty butchered an anchorite i always work safely returned he you have only saved me the trouble for never would i have rested till by some artifice i had drawn you once more hither and god you see most graciously has sent you  blaspheme not thy maker oh cruel wretch sighed i in a tremulous accent just though severe are all his ordinations and lo with sad submission i take the death appointed me even from thy hands  no cried he though you are not the haughty beauty i adored yet as the wife of that imperious lord you become but a more perfect means of exquisite revenge  the nature of that revenge blazed in his eyes  my heart turned to marble within me i raised my eyes toward heaven in speechless agony and rivetting them on lord leicester found life recede too fast for my ear to distinguish one word of that bitter indignation which the voice it loved so loudly uttered  i almost doubted whether my senses were indeed returned when i found myself involved in impenetrable darkness the piercing sigh of some one near me was the only sound that broke the stillness of the night if cried i in a feeble tone that is the voice to which my heart was born to vibrate oh tell me beloved leicester whether the scene which yet swims before my sight was real or a vision gracious heaven returned he in a voice yet more piercing you breathe again my souls best treasure the long long fainting caused by the threats of that execrable monster gave me hopes you had finally escaped a fate too horrid for reflection oh dire extreme of despair and misery when i am condemned to wish you dead and yet what else can deliver you  yet think not matilda i fear to follow  ah no the best blood burning in this bosom should joyfully embalm you but the thoughts of all which may precede that moment almost urges me to dash my distracted brain against the stones on which i lie and shorten my own sufferings since hopeless of averting yours call up your fortitude your reason your religion returned i in a firmer voice an emotion which united all those sentiments diffusing itself through my frame dare i accuse the almighty of injustice will he who first gave my helpless innocence a hallowed shelter within these walls ordain they should prove its tomb the shades of those who reared me will surely rise in its defense alas my love sighed he in a despairing voice these visionary hopes may soothe the mind till that sad moment nothing can avert  have you forgot that even in happier times you hoped nothing from the villain and is this an hour to expect a change revenge and poverty have seared his soul to all humanity how how could it ever escape my memory that he was acquainted with the secret of the recess how under such uncertainty durst i ever venture within it but shortsighted man solely employed in weaving snares for others too late finds his own feet entangled and falls an easy prey to the ignoble not satisfied with heading this set of coiners for such their apparatus proved them his daring disposition breaks forth in acts of plunder and barbarity and even at this moment he is seeking new victims though possessing unsought those he would out of the whole world have chosen shall we complain heaven has quite abandoned us resumed i when it has given us but one moment to ourselves oh leicester you have hitherto found me a tender anxious fearful woman but alas i knew not till now the powers of my own soul  abhorrent of shame and dishonor it tempts me to the most desperate deeds if yours is indeed congenial it surely understands me assume a roman courage and save thy wife thy spotless wife from horrible pollution so much i agonize at the idea cried lord leicester that were these hands free perhaps   and mine too added i feeble as they are alike are bound yet surely despair will give me strength to loose them the violent efforts i made at last broke the slight thong they thought more than sufficient to confine one in my feeble state and encouraged by my success i sought lord leicester at the moment i restored his liberty i half revived while the sole use the tender leicester could make of his arms was to press me a thousand times to his swelled heart which almost burst with sobbing i struggled against all the sad tenderness which throbbed at mine oh think no more of love cried i with increasing heroism it has given place to death  to worse than death  rather imagine you hear this dungeon once more open  but can i lift that hand which pledged it self for thy protection against thy life thy precious life groaned he  can i deface that angel form which still illumes my soul through all these complicated horrors and oh our dear unborn for whom we gladly suffered can i can i destroy it think think my life returned i we have perhaps this only moment  had these wretches left any means of death in my own hands do you imagine i would supplicate it from yours strangle me now while darkness favors your wife demands of you this final proof of love and courage here is will at least vie with it no groan no struggle shall issue from a heart which then will return innocent to that dust from which it sprung devoted alone to the adored husband with whose image it is doubly inhabited oh matchless matchless woman cried my lord flooding my cheek with tears of generous anguish never never can it be my sinews relax to childhood your unhopedfor fortitude totally subdues mine and melts my soul to womans weakness  oh thou who gave me this angel can thou have abandoned her to brutality and me to distraction  a peal of thunder which shook the ruins to their foundation seemed to reprove his boldness the livid lightning pervaded our dungeon through many a timeworn aperture during every tremendous illumination i gazed awestruck on the pallid face of my love till suddenly glancing around i gave a cry which startled even myself  glowing gasping transported yet still unable to speak i sunk before my lord and clasping both his hands alternately pressed them to my heart and lifted them with mine toward heaven what means my beloved exclaimed he in almost equal surprise and agitation has pitying providence deprived her of her senses ah no it is god himself who has illumined them faltered i at last what dungeon has man yet discovered the almighty cannot you have perhaps forgot my love that you have often heard of one communication from the recess to the abbey closed up on the death of mrs marlow it was never opened after nor was it known to that horrible villain this dismal den contains it and we tread on the only spot in the creation which could shelter us from those ruffians in the corner on the right hand covered with lumber placed long since on purpose you will find a trap door if you have strength to raise it strong fastenings will secure it on the other side at least till we reach the abbey oh thou added i devoutly raising my eyes who alone could preserve us continue those flashes more welcome than ever yet the sun was  indelibly impressed with the present danger it was not till we had descended into the vaults and fastened that blessed door between ourselves and the banditti that either recollected what we might apprehend at the abbey assured none but an opulent owner could reside in a seat so splendid we vainly racked imagination to discover its present possessor yet persuaded even our worst enemies would rescue us with pleasure from a peril so nearly connected with themselves we were obliged to defy every other the housekeepers room into which the passage led was empty yet scattered furniture etc indicated inhabitants i hailed with true devotion that power who gave me once more to see the soft luster of the moon which on the subsiding of the storm diffused serenity retaining in his hand the bar which had been one fastening of the abbey entrance as the only weapon in his power lord leicester followed my trembling steps they turned intuitively to the apartment of mrs marlow ah that there i could have found her i paused at the door of the antichamber my heart sickened with despondency knowing there was an immediate necessity for rousing and arming the whole family yet convinced we must at first alarm them as preternatural beings and afterward with the conviction our escape introduced a danger to themselves while ignorant whom we were going to appear before well might the firmest heart tremble engrossed by these various and affecting ideas i hardly heard a sound which made lord leicester start forward with an eagerness that might easily have deprived me of the little strength heaven had left me the antichamber into which i immediately followed him was dark but in the room beyond i perceived a lights and heard the voice of a woman apparently supplicating scarcely had i distinguished in that of the man who answered her the dreaded williams ere i saw lord leicester start forward levelling the bar with so desperate a boldness that the fall of the villain ascertained our safety instantly snatching a knife from the wretchs hand he pointed it at his bosom but perceived a perforation in the brain which made his punishment terrible as his guilt and his death immediate execrable monster cried my lord dropping the knife by unlookedfor means heaven at last has finished thee  gracious god cried the lady do i hear the voice of lord leicester  amazed at this discovery and the preceding event hardly could my trembling limbs convey me into the chamber approach my dear matilda cried my lord never more shall this wretch appal thee eternal justice is satisfied with one blow nor need i turn assassin even to him happy at the same moment in saving this lady endeavor to interest her for those misfortunes in which she already seems interwoven  can lord leicester have any misfortune in which i am not interwoven cried the lady to have received my life from his hands alone could reconcile me to it had i not known the speaker by her voice to be the fair rose cecil such language must have ascertained it yet to find ourselves under the roof of our most mortal enemy was a cruel stroke is it possible we should be in the house of lord burleigh cried lord leicester disdainfully she sighing replied he fortunately is absent nor can you ever be unsafe in any house where i am mistress you know not to whom you speak cried i in turn alas miss cecil do you still remember the friendship you have so often professed for the unfortunate matilda ever has see lamented the sad necessity of veiling her fate from a heart so noble accept then at this unexpected moment that confidence i always longed to place in you and tell me whether you still can resolve to love her who was the wife of lord leicester long ere she saw you her who at this moment renders him a fugitive in his own country her distressful eyes wandered from him to me for some moments in silence then taking a hand of each she first kissed and afterward uniting them said with a spartan firmness my friend but turning instantly from him to hide her glowing cheeks and impassioned tears in my bosom sobbed out my deliverer her beauty which was rendered more obvious by her disordered appearance the ruffian having compelled her to rise and half dress herself her innocence and her generosity appeared at last a little to affect lord leicester who had hitherto shown her an indifference almost amounting to disgust it remains with you madam returned he in a softer voice now to become mine miss cecil no longer sees the worshipped favorite of an imperious queen united alike by choice and law to the dear companion of my dangers a chain of occurrences reduces us to escape by unknown means from england and with the utmost dispatch nevertheless those even elizabeths rage might have spared were only an hour ago devoted by that lifeless villain escaped this moment almost from a den of slaughter hardly can we tell whether the banditti of whom this was the ringleader are not now surrounding us summon all your courage and your domestics and while providing for your own safety i need not solicit you to remember ours when i forget it may i be condemned to see you perish cried she then turning to me with that innocent candor which eminently distinguished her sought a pardon in my eyes collecting all her thoughts she continued in a few moments  astonished as i must be both at your circumstances and your visit my noble friends curiosity yields to friendship with the morning i expect my father nor is there any safety for you but immediate flight nevertheless this danger with which you say we are environed must be the first consideration i then explained to her the secret of the recess the direful mistake which had thrown us into the power of its present diabolical tenants and the desperation which the discovery of our escape and the means by which it was effected must inevitably cause except indeed the loss of williams should abate their ferocity while i talked i frequently perceived her mind wandered on another subject she surveyed the disguised persons and pale faces of both my lord and me a thousand times over by fits she shook with horror at the story i was relating and by starts she forgot i had been speaking and obliged me to go back in my tale employed chiefly in concerting the means of securing our safety her own seemed hardly a consideration such is the nature of love in the mind of a virtuous woman i see said she when i had finished the necessity for some bodys appearing to account to my servants for the discovery of the villains i see too that lord leicester cannot be the person for who can fail to know him the inference thus tenderly conveyed was obvious one must be seen but i could not resolve to be that one without a dismay which surpassed complaint yes my dear matilda added she we must part with him for a little time but you will rejoin him for life by the ordination of providence as i could almost suppose the son of my nurse is now in the house a young man over whom that circumstance gives me a powerful influence against the choice of his friends he embraced a seafaring life till he acquired enough money to purchase a small vessel with which he trades between the coast of devonshire and that of france but disgusted at the profession he chose it was only yesterday he arrived here to solicit my interest with my father to promote him in a civil line say not then heaven frowns on your flight since it plainly points cut a secure mode of escape i cannot but discern every avenue to holland must be effectually closed but who could think of tracing you to the distant and obscure coast of devonshire it is true the journey is long but to compensate for that you must recollect it is safe the travels of arthur have been confined to the road by which he conducts you and his connections are doubtless among people who will furnish you with every common comfort without having curiosity or understanding to penetrate through the mystery of your rank i see too what your expressive eyes my dear matilda would point out  the impossibility of long concealing the share i have had in your fate since how else can your miraculous appearance here or the terrible death of my midnight visitor be accounted for but i what of that she generously added after a moments pause much ought to be ventured when our all is at stake i have expected every moment said my lord some dreadful interruption from the rest of these wretches no returned miss cecil i have every reason to imagine he was alone in this enterprise when first by his entrance i started from the slumber into which i was falling i began collecting my purse and every ornament near me he rejected them all and compelling me to rise commanded me with terrible imprecations to conduct him to the private cabinet where my father concealed his state papers hoping doubtless by possessing them to obtain many secrets which might ensure his own pardon for that must have been his ultimate object i knew too well the character of my father not to debate whether i should not rather give up my life than a trust so precious when the terrible intervention of lord leicester released me from the conflict yet i agree with you a moment ought not to be lost and first let me lock up the room which contains so shocking a testimony that more than one man has intruded there at midnight conscious of her own merit she encountered even the eye of lord leicester without tremor who could not but admire in her at that moment all the magnanimity and foresight which ennobles man with every softer grace which half deifies woman for my own part i clasped her to my bosom declaring i could never love her more than i did long ere this proof of her merit this is the only topic dangerous to either returned she a tear beatifying her smile we will all love one another as well as we can but now my lord attend to the next step if you dare rely on my direction we will conduct you to the door leading to the garden make your way over the wall on the side farthest from the wood a mile beyond there is a bridge wait near it in silence arthur shall first hide a horse for you and then set out on another to convey this lady as if to her home in some adjacent village the confusion attending the discovery of the vaulted passage will render the family most probably inattentive to her presence or departure and ere they can be enough at leisure to discover williams or form any dangerous conjecture you will both be i hope beyond the reach of discovery or pursuit but oh my lord if you would have either of the trembling wretches now before you survive this night of horrors use the strictest caution in seeking your appointed shelter nor leave it till you hear the voice of matilda  lord leicester promised and conducting him softly through the house we reached the door leading to the garden all the horrors of the past were short of what i felt at that moment after the dangers i had shared and escaped with my lord to see him depart was to quit my guardian angel or to deprive him of his yet convinced miss cecil was actuated by the same fearful affection i yielded myself up to the desperate emergency and acquiesced the closing of the door after him severed the hearts of both it was then only we knew the support we had derived from his presence wan speechless helpless we durst hardly turn our eyes on any object but each other nor utter a sigh but it swelled into a groan and the ghastly body of williams seemed for ever to impede out footsteps floating the path with blood miss cecil took the only possible method to divert our terrors and soon rousing a few terrified domestics commanded them to summon all the family a command which needed no repetition a few minutes gathered together eighteen or twenty men sufficiently armed to secure us from any personal danger i conducted the whole astonished body to the private door through which i had entered i described the place to which it led and touching slightly on my own danger and escape recommended to them that profound silence the villains had preserved toward us with such fatal success during this time miss cecil selected the man she mentioned to us and retiring into the next room gave him her orders unobserved so entirely did both my appearance and strange story engross the attention of every individual belonging to the family miss cecil rejoining us ordered them to divide and while half remained to guard the house the rest should descend and passing into the dungeon from whence i came wait the return of the banditti and seize them one by one as they entered this conclusion of the adventure greatly damped the ardour of the group but ashamed to recede from a place through which i had apparently escaped alone they departed in so numerous a body as might almost fill the den in which i was lately enclosed the few who remained hovering near the entrance solely intent on the event of the enterprise arthur in the interim having the full command of the stables made ready two horses in the manner already mentioned and miss cecil with her usual foresight overwhelmed me with refreshments which a little invigorated my exhausted frame nor did she forget to provide arthur with such as might recruit my lord selecting from her wardrobe linen and every necessary the time and occasion admitted impatiently i expected the summons to depart which was preceded by a message from the recess that all was hitherto entirely silent and the door fastened as when we left it a circumstance which appalled my inmost soul as it seemed to leave us still in the reach of the merciless banditti with mingled tears of grief and hope i embraced that generous friend i never more might see and quitting the once hospitable mansion which seemed of all the universe the only home my heart acknowledged i seated myself behind a guide whose sunburned features softened into a compassion few indeed could at that moment have denied me the moon shone forth with resplendent luster and our road being in a contrary direction to that which before ensnared us i recommended myself to heaven and anxiously expected the meeting with my lord we had not proceeded far when that dear protector who had in fearful affection for me defied his own danger and returned almost to the abbey started from under a clump of trees and with a voice that dissipated terror welcomed my return to freedom and sprung upon the horse our guide before led for him such is the effect of an evil escaped that i almost forgot my excessive fatigue and could have fancied myself safe  recent circumstances at first occupied my thoughts and during the intervals of silence the addition of a stranger must naturally impose my imagination once more returned to the dungeon it pictured the fear and horror the wretches themselves must in turn feel when unknown hands condemned them to a fate like that they had allotted to us again i wandered to the court i seemed to see elizabeth burning with embosomed rage while the helpless noble ellinor became as its immediate its only object i greatly relied on the watchful friendship of all the sydneys but hardly could i hope even they could rescue her from the queen i knew the letter lord leicester had ordered to be delivered to elizabeth two hours after our departure with the confirmation that must give it would infallibly explain to her the secret of our marriage which of itself confuted the tale he had advanced concerning our birth nor could i doubt but every artifice would be practiced to unfold the whole mystery and alas ungenerous minds too often fasten on the victim cruel fortune puts most into their power  yet in the haste and confusion attending our flight we had found it impossible to unite my sister in it neither at that unhappy juncture could she be found and all the care we could show for her safety was to recommend her in the most strenuous manner to those few friends we expected the discovery would leave us while ellinor had the resolution to retain her own secret we knew the power of the queen could not reach her and the strength and foresight she had at many times shown persuaded me she was equal even to this hardest of trials yet could i think of the insolent interrogatories and contumely she must inevitably encounter without a bleeding heart to be the gaze of every eye  the object of every tongue  oh greatly did she need the consciousness of innocence the pride of royalty to sustain her  it had ever been our plan if fortunate enough to escape safely into france to remain still in disguise till couriers from england could convince us how far the plot of babington and particularly lord leicesters knowledge of it had transpired if it appeared his share in that scheme was undiscovered my lord might with safety avow himself as marrying privately was a crime only in the eye of elizabeth and knowing too well her favorites ought ever to consider their influence as precarious lord leicester had scattered large sums in the hands of different merchants in various kingdoms as a resource he now found his only one nor was it insufficient if on the contrary we learnt elizabeth had dived into that dangerous mystery he was censurable only for concealing by the charge of treason she could perhaps affect his safety in france nay almost in europe and to preserve his life some disguise must still be maintained while here is lasted  though separated in infancy from every one allied to me nothing could ever detach my heart from family claims not daring to look toward my mother i had always passionately desired to see the sole surviving sister of my father margaret lady mortimer educated with the late queen in the catholic persuasion she had married a general and with him held many distinguished places under philip and mary the revolution both in politics and religion caused by the accession of elizabeth was fatal alike to her honors and her pleasures general lord mortimer followed the widowed king to spain and raised on his favor a fortune that gave him power to fix his own fate when death suddenly decided it his relict retired to rouen in normandy where his sister was then abbess leaving her younger son in the service of philip and her elder in the army of francis iid naturally of an active temper she could not resolve to give up the world though attached to it only by disgusts and lavished a large portion of the immense fortune her mother and husband had united to bequeath her in cherishing every exiled enemy of elizabeth elated with the vain hope of one day seeing her illfated brother throned in conjunction with the queen of scots she entered into all his measures while that union was in agitation and emerging once more from her convent journeyed to rome where she spared neither pains nor money to win friends who might authorize and ratify it she was among the few who knew the marriage secretly took place she even knew it was likely to produce heirs of royalty and misfortune when the discovery trial and execution of the duke of norfolk entirely crushed her last fond project from that moment she had remained uninformed of the secret soul of mary and the fate of her un happy offspring the avowed disgust she had shown toward elizabeth made it dangerous for her to return to her own country and hardly in it could she have arrived at such important intelligence when once the clue was lost aspiring rich and restless she still affected to appear the patroness of all oppressed englishmen and if i found it prudent to avow myself i might safely rely on a welcome from her who would find with joy every hope so long extinct renovated in me our present journey conducted us to a coast almost opposite to that of normandy i fancied a pleasure in having it in my power to claim her cares in the approaching melancholy crisis and was not without hopes lord leicester might safely appear in his own person when once my sister had escaped to rejoin us  these various reflections fully occupied my mind till the dawn of day when our guide assured us we might safely rest in the hamlet to which we were near convinced by miss cecils confidence in him he might fully be trusted i entered with weary limbs a cottage from whence its laborious inhabitants were just issuing to work they used their utmost diligence to procure us a homely meal and we retired almost stupefied with intense fatigue to a bed which had only cleanliness to recommend it here both sunk into a repose so profound that the day was closing when we arose our watchful guide assured us we must hasten over the dinner which long had waited for us as we had many miles to journey ere we could find a safe resting place earnestly did i wish to remain with our present hosts till the next morning but submitting to necessity remounted in silence arthur well justified the confidence of his lady having selected horses that never flagged through the whole journey and always guarding against discovery by conducting us through roads very little frequented among which he found hamlets whose inhabitants were gratified in merely seeing him and who only attended to his companions in the hope of obliging him i was astonished at observing how little curiosity we excited forgetful that the mind is worn down with the body and that a common laborer rarely considers any thing beyond those common comforts incessant industry alone can procure him  insensible to the beauties of the country through which we passed i was for ever employed in looking for the sea and when at last i discovered it strove to extend my sight beyond and dwell on that shore where i alone could think lord leicester safe the nearer we drew toward the coast the stronger my fears became it was inhabited chiefly by men hard by nature and desperate by profession accustomed to murder as well as plunder those wrecked on the shore they sternly examined and defied every passenger i could hardly persuade myself some of these were not stragglers from the banditti of williams and blessed heaven as though all peril had been past when we arrived at the homely dwelling of arthur  stood on a lonely part of the shore where lofty cliffs shooting far into the sea gave safety in the little bay to a few fishingboats and small vessels ah how do our awakened passions entirely curb every prejudice of late those livid lightnings at which my nature ever before shrunk appeared but the quivering lamp of love now i saw and heard undaunted the encircling sea once the happy boundary of human pursuits whose restless waves roar a proud defiance to all who dare approach it and my sole fear sprung from learning that the wind was entirely contrary and the watery chasm yet impassable  too late we lamented departing unattended unable in this sequestered spot to discover any part of what had passed in the court since our flight and unwilling to trust as well as unable to spare our guide or his friends to make an enquiry at the next town two most tedious days elapsed in melancholy and conjecture arthur not being able to go out in his own vessel without suspicions and examinations we durst not encounter hired a large fishing smack in which he stored the few necessaries our limited situation allowed us to provide and i watched without ceasing the playing of its streamers on the evening of the third day i perceived them suddenly point toward france rest having recruited my strength and spirits i started up in a transport of joy the few mariners being gathered at last together i stepped with a lightened heart into a miserable boat which bore us swiftly toward that destined to convey us over when two strangers riding full speed to the shore called to us to put back with the most frantic eagerness i took the alarm and offered the mariners imaginary worlds to row on when arthur insisting he knew the voice and disregarding all i could urge turned the boat i threw my arms round my lord as though my heart would have opened to hide him and regardless of his remonstrances that we could be in no danger from only two people however hostile their intention my senses died away recovering at last i found myself in the cabin of the vessel reclining on the bosom of lord leicester while a youth who knelt at my feet pressed my hands alternately to his lips  look up my beloved cried my lord and see whom fortune has united in our exile ah rather do not look up lovely matilda cried miss cecil for it was that sweet girl indeed in the habit of a boy till you have considered what reception you ought to give the selfish friend who has dared interweave her sat with yours yet hear before you judge me added she rising with a mild majesty which gave unspeakable graces to the blushes that every moment visited and retired from her cheeks i am going to lay my whole heart before you both it is in vain to attempt veiling a weakness from lord leicester so many circumstances have concurred to betray it remains with me then to ennoble it the discovery of your marriage my amiable friends quenched the last feeble hope which lingered in my heart convinced my partiality could never become his happiness i instantly resolved it should become his pride selflove expired before the elevated idea ah what but this could have enabled me to lead him into the garden at midnight and take a look i then thought a last one without dropping a single tear i saw in a moment all the merit the charms of her character whom he had chosen should i hate her then for being all i would have endeavored to be for accepting that distinction which not depending on youth beauty merit or fortune is the dearest bounty of indulgent heaven ah no my heart was juster and welcomed her as one born to divide it with lord leicester solely intent on the prosperous flight of both i almost forgot the servants planted in the recess and all the monsters that infested it i fancied to myself those hours when all your dangers past you would sometimes think of her who could only think of you i heard both sigh and wishing but to be enough remembered to soften without wounding either heart i sighed myself and started from these pleasant reveries at the voice of our steward who rushing abruptly into the room dismayed my every sense with his recital rejoice madam rejoice cried the man with honest zeal and think this stranger born for your service never can we enough adore the astonishing interposition of heaven it is not long since when tired with watching in the dungeon a variety of voices struck our ears which soon approaching us every man summoned all his courage shortly the door was unbolted and a ruffian darted in whose daring look was changed to an icy paleness which lights from behind reflected when he found each arm seized by one of our people while a third held a pistol to his head uttering a faint imprecation he alarmed the rest and both sides immediately fired we then pushed forward without any regard for those who fell and pursuing the rest through the various avenues of the den secured them all as we have reason to imagine astonishment half depriving them of the power of resistance in the largest apartment of this strange place we found guess madam how we were amazed our lord with an unknown lady and three of our fellow servants who were newly brought in by the ruffians and bound nor do i doubt but a dreadful death was designed them but for this wonderful event alienated as my affections must long have been from my father continued miss cecil turning the discourse to herself i could not hear of so wonderful an escape without feeling the most lively satisfaction it was damped however by recollecting the body of williams i saw too plainly i must now account for it to one invested with authority to enquire and resolution to convict me lost in a variety of plans my father had been some minutes in the house ere i stirred from my own antichamber where the approach of lord burleigh entirely confined me faint and silent i arose and bending before him wept forth my duty and my joy i know all you would say my child cried he eagerly and how this horrible place was discovered but where is lord leicester and his lady struck dumb with a question as clear and decisive as if he had been a sharer in the transactions of the night my eyes were fixed upon him in terror and stupefaction when my brother impatient to discover both made his way at once into my chamber whither the loud exclamation he gave collected all present nor could my father resist hastening as fast as his infirmities permitted hoping as i had reason to imagine he there should find that enemy who more engrossed his thoughts than the preservation of his own life or mine how were all amazed when the lifeless villain williams alone appeared some examined his pockets while others searched the chamber my father spoke not for some time when fixing an eye on me falsehood never durst encounter he pointed ironically to the body you killed him doubtless said he and relapsed again into his meditation after a time some faint remembrance glanced across his mind he drew near and examining the dead mans features seemed to recollect and in recollecting to dread him for at once he shrunk into himself and repeated in a low voice  that villain not having however any clue to his thoughts though he had to mine there rested my idea of the matter i collected all my courage and framing the most plausible tale the present situation allowed resolved to abide by it whatever the event my father likewise settled his plan of proceeding and far from regulating the servants whose every motion fear made wild and eccentric turned his attention solely on me rising at last with a stern air rose said he follow me i had of late been but too much accustomed to that harsh voice and obeyed in silence seating himself in an adjacent apartment he demanded an exact recital of all the horrors of the night i commenced with the being roused by williams i related his design and the threats which almost brought my life to the point of a moment when substituting arthur for lord leicester i affirmed it was his providential arrival guided by an unknown lady and the desperate courage supplied by the emergency which rescued me from the knife of that inveterate villain he interrupted me eagerly enquiring for the lady on my assuring him she was gone  think well cried he in a terrible voice think well rash romantic girl ere you venture again to answer me i know the cause of leicesters flight i know too its companion i know that he escaped a few hours before from the dungeon in which i was found i know if so who must be his confederate stain to the name of cecil degenerate wretch not content with the blind credulity of youth to embosom rescue and abet a traitor will thou conceal his wife tremble at the vengeance of thy sovereign  tremble alike at that of thy father convinced by whatever wonderful means he was so fully informed that i could not hope to delude him i started up my complexion changing every moment i indeed find myself my lord cried i unequal to a falsehood but you will find me equal to the most desperate truth it was lord leicester i own whom heaven itself brought to my relief and shall i deliver him up to death who saved me from it oh never never sheltered in a spot less liable to suspicion than that from which they lately escaped he with his chosen happy bride can safely wait till the violence of the queen gives place to justice tortures should wring no more from me and whatever my fate it will always admit of one sweet consolation in the remembrance that heaven allowed me to recompense a benefit at the moment of receiving it why should i repeat sighed our fair narrator all the rage tears and altercation that for a few days made life a torment to me totally confined to my apartment and treated like a criminal it was even hinted my continued obstinacy would provoke my father into making that horrible den the recess my prison in one instance alone was i fortunate my mysterious speech impressed on my fathers mind an opinion he had previously adopted that lord leicester with his lady must be secreted in or near kenilworth castle whither his most trusted spies immediately resorted and amused him with various suppositions dispatched daily from thence oppressed with unkindness and severity often did my weak my wavering heart prompt me to follow and if possible overtake you but the instant recollection of the obvious track such a rash flight must open to your inveterate pursuers always subdued so unjustifiable a wish my father at once changed his measures and releasing carried me with him to every suspected place in the neighborhood hoping from the alteration of my features he should discover that which contained lord leicester by a fatality which completed my misfortunes in one of these tours we encountered irton that lover who cost me both the queens and my fathers favor encouraged by lord burleigh once more he returned with us incapable of love but infatuated with politics his ardent desire of holding a rank in his favorite line through my means revived regardless of my tears coldness and disdain he had always looked up to my father as the decider of his fate and still continued to do so i had the misery of learning a bargain was made of which i must be the unconsenting pledge and that almost immediately i knew my fathers inexorable nature i knew likewise that of irton and had reason to dread the next fit of rage might consign me to legal infamy unless by a desperation on my own part i prevented this on theirs wonder not that at last i yielded to think of a measure so long combated i selected a servant in whom i had a confidence who procured me this disguise and offered to protect me i blessed that faith i could never hope sufficiently to reward and winged alike with hope and fear pursued your route with indefatigable diligence leaving a letter which spoke of london as my asylum  to this generous recital my lord and self replied with reiterated assurances of friendship and protection as well as the highest encomiums on her courage and conduct shortly after my lord quitted the cabin you who have long been the confidante the sole confidante of my weakness resumed miss cecil in a tender tone while her doubtful eye seemed to search my very soul will be less surprised at its effect than its confession yet even that strange as it may seem sprung from prudence i had well considered my dear matilda every part of my past and future conduct i too plainly felt while i imagined my lord a stranger to the impulses of my heart it might still adhere to him with a dangerous tenderness by the boldness of this step i have made him a judge over me and shall act with the severest prudence i know your generous disposition seeing only the better part of mine might have induced you still to wish me near you  how could i resist so sweet an invitation ah only by silencing the most decisive pleader lord leicester can now never urge me on the dangerous subject in whatever place you fix your residence i will retire to a neighboring monastery as a boarder where always hearing of and sometimes seeing both added she in a voice broken by sobs my wishes will be completed nor do i imagine you will in the interim grudge me a share in lord leicesters danger ah little do you know me returned i pressing her hand affectionately if you think i could grudge you a share in his happiness never my tender generous girl never more will we part never could lord leicester hope or his wife fear any thing unbecoming from a soul like yours actuated by one sentiment counterparts by nature of each other you and i should violate her laws were we to separate to own the whole truth my sweet friend returned she with her usual noble ingenuousness i expected this instance of your generosity but it only confirms my resolution and my own heart would anticipate the condemnation of yours were it possible for me to waver  a sense of safety and of gratitude to my fair friend diffused itself through my soul as the evening closed to which i had for some time been a stranger lord leicester pressed us to enjoy the sweetness of the hour we ascended the deck and seating ourselves in a little boat lashed to it every fear every hope seemed suspended and the present all of our lives for which any had a sense the gentle breezes only played upon the white sails and the vessel cut with a safe and pleasant motion through those green waves whose points the full moon exquisitely silvered as breaking they gave life to the stillness of the night i turned my eyes with the sweetest satisfaction from my love to my friend from my friend to my love the same mild orb delicately illumd either face a manly tenderness marked lord leicesters attention to me a grateful deference that to her while the fair rose rich in the applauses of her own heart and nobly conscious of her claims on ours forgot there was any thing wanting to her happiness these sacred pauses in life which lovers only know invigorate the soul as sleep does the body and alone can enable us to sustain the past and coming ills prepared by a mental calm for the happiest repose sleep asserted a claim to those hours fear and fatigue had long possessed and my lord insisted on remaining above the loveliness of the weather though the autumn was far advanced made this less dangerous and miss cecil and i at last consented to occupy the only miserable bed which nevertheless afforded us that rest a palace had often denied the next morning entirely reversed the scene and destroyed at once our comfort and tranquillity with the moon the weather changed and the wind becoming entirely contrary that deadly sickness incident to the element seized alike on miss cecil and me absorbing even the sense of danger with an exhausted sullenness we surveyed those roaring surges whose hollows fancy could not venture to fathom and saw ourselves driven almost back to the shore of england without strength or spirits even to lament our cruel destiny my lord happily more used to the sea resisted its influence and exerted himself equally in comforting the sufferers and assisting the sailors happily too they were all well acquainted with the coast while the contrary wind and enraged elements constituted in one sense our safety as every other vessel taking shelter in the nearest port waited in safety more favorable weather tossed about for near ten days we at last made havredegrace early in the morning and more dead than alive i was conveyed to the first inn and instantly put to bed  here my fatigues and apprehensions were very near producing a misfortune i from the first had dreaded i had but too much reason to fear that the poor babe who had been the innocent cause of these calamities would never live to reward us for them but urged into a premature existence of all this mighty world would claim only a grave the grief this gave me increased the danger i knew the passionate desire of offspring which possessed my lord i had often flattered myself this wish if indulged would fill up that void in his life the promise had caused what then should i suffer to see a disappointment added to the sacrifices and degradations i had already entailed upon him it was at this crisis all the merit of miss cecil shone forth to the delicate attentions of a friend she united the soft solicitude of a mother she soothed my mind with the most flattering hopes and jealous lest in any fretful moment my secret soul should doubt her attachment she so entirely forestalled every suspicion that uninformed spectators would rather have imagined me the only source of her happiness than the sole obstacle to it at length i conquered the danger and then my spirits returned faster than my strength often i talked of england of my sister and the expected dispatches i wrote to lady mortimer and briefly related those incidents i have here explained in many pages i claimed her alliance her protection explained the present delicate situation of my health and enclosed my picture in little not doubting but that would identify my birth and part of the diamonds we brought with us were converted into money to establish our rank if we found it prudent to acknowledge it  i continued a long time too weak to quit my chamber yet at intervals a new fear disturbed me i perceived my lord absent and anxious frequently an extreme paleness overcame the floridness of nature and traversing the room for hours he would give way to a chagrin the cause of which not all my tenderest entreaties could wring from him i often recalled the words of my sister i fancied he vainly regretted the distinction of royalty the pride of splendour and the pleasure of popularity accustomed to be the object of every eye to have every wish forestalled to be obeyed ere he spoke i sighing owned the change in his fate might well appear dreary not daring to hint my ideas i impatiently expected the return of the express sent to rouen hoping it would open new prospects and disperse the heavy cloud between him and felicity but oh how delusive is human perspicacity  insolently vain of our bounded knowledge we boast of tracing every thought and action of individuals seas divide from us even at the very moment we misjudge all with whom we are immediately surrounded my fond attention fixed partially on lord leicester looked not out of himself for causes of grief lady mortimers answer at length arrived she acknowledged her relationship to me with surprise and pleasure and kindly lamented her infirm health did not permit her to pay in coming to me that deference my regal birth entitled me to but that her train waited our permission to escort us to rouen whither she urged us to hasten as well for our own safety as to gratify her impatience my expectations being fully answered by this letter breathless with joy i raised my eyes to lord leicester who had been perusing it over my shoulder they met his full of a sadness so meaning it numbed my very heart  long used now to dread every day would teem with some horrible event i snatched his hand and in broken accents only begged to know it he sunk at my feet and hiding his tears with my robe swelled with sobs that almost cracked my heartstrings you have told me you loved me matilda said he in a broken and doubtful voice  told you reechoed i heavens and earth can that my lord remain a question have i not for you forgot the rights of sex of rank of every thing but love have i not done all could to deserve these sacrifices again demanded he debate no more admitted merits cried i with wild impatience oh give me the truth and all the truth at once nor doubly torture me with this pomp of preparation whatever it is i will remember there might be a worse since my eyes still behold you every evil but your danger my soul can cope with you speak not yet we are then discovered betrayed delivered up condemned  the fatal power of elizabeth has reached us even here for nothing else can surely thus affect you it has indeed sighed he oh why then exclaimed i forgetful of all my assurances am i unprovided with poison for death must now be the only mercy hoped may the ocean from which we with so much difficulty escaped entomb us on our return rather than resign us up to her licensed vengeance the power of elizabeth has reached us added he more mournfully though not in our own persons safe still in my arms in my heart you may my love long arraign and bewail a misfortune all europe will bewail with you his sympathising eyes explained the truth  the agonizing truth  my soul understood him  aghast with horror my eyes seemed to set and every limb to stiffen to marble a sensation to which fainting is ease condensed every faculty and nature powerful nature struck on my heart at the thought of my mother with a pang perhaps equal to that with which she bore me the radiant sun of love seemed to dip into a sea of blood and sink there for ever unable to reduce the torrent of my ideas into language i buried my head in my robe and pointed to the door that all might leave me happily my lord saw a prudence in indulging me and laying down several letters instantly retired a horrible transport for some moments benumbed me  how multiplied how complicate how various how new were then my feelings feelings which ever return with the remembrance feelings which opened a vein in my character as well as my heart  all sense of gentleness vanished the first paper i perused confirmed my fears  i saw in the first lines the decided fate of the martyred mary  i seemed to behold the savage hand of elizabeth dipped in the blood of an anointed sister sovereign  i felt she was my mother my fond my helpless mother and my heart floated in tears which were hours working their way up to my burning eyes the furies of orestes seemed to surround me and thunder parricide nothing but parricide in my ear what groaned i after so long an endurance such complicated evils supported with a patience that left not her enemies a pretense for sacrificing her that misery was reserved for her daughter perhaps even at the moment she laid that beauteous head so many hearts were born to worship on the block every agony of death was doubled by the knowledge her daughter brought her there  why did i not perish in the recess by lightning why did not the ocean entomb me why why oh god was i permitted to survive my innocence in the wildness of my affliction i cursed the hour the fatal hour when i ventured beyond the bounds prescribed me yes love love itself was annihilated and could i once have believed it deeply did i wish i had never seen lord leicester passing from paper to paper i saw friends and enemies unite in the eulogium of the royal martyr what magnanimity what sweetness what sanctitude did they assign to her  a bright example in the most awful of trials  subliming the idea of revenge inseparable from human nature she centered it all in comparison  and what a comparison  casting off the veil of her mortality to darken over the future days of elizabeth the radiant track of her ascension concentered while it dimmed the eyes of those surrounding nations who too late bewailed their shameful inactivity spirit of the royal mary oh thou most injured sighed out at last my exhausted soul from that blessedness to which the wretch now levelled with the dust perhaps too early translated thee beam peace and pardon assuage the horrors of the involuntary sin and oh receive my life as its expiation or a little but a little soothe its sad remainder  yet vain and uncertain were all my ideas respecting the discovery i imputed to elizabeth convinced nothing had ever been entrusted to friendship i was assured nothing could have been betrayed in the bosom of my sister our mutual secret rested and there i imagined every motive must bury it i reviewed every paper once more alas i only added to my affliction by observing the name of ellinor industriously avoided lost in conjecture it was some time ere i perceived one letter my robe half covered i pressed to my lips the writing of lady arundel  scarce dare i allow myself time to congratulate you my most honored friends on escaping the deadly rage of elizabeth so much do i know you long for news of your sister alas that i could return in that information the pleasure yours gave me called to visit lady pembroke whose danger was too sudden for me to be apprized of it ellinor returned to court the very hour my lord and you left it filling the place of my sister who ought to have been in waiting by this means she was unfortunately present at the time the queen perused lord leicesters explanatory letter unbounded in her resentment she levelled it all against the unfortunate ellinor and in severely taxing her with treachery and guilt dropped expressions by which your sister learnt the dangerous situation your flight had unfortunately placed her in as well as the evils to which you both stood exposed grief fear and indignation almost deprived her of reason and the queen insisting her silence proceeded from obstinacy threw at her a large book she had been reading which striking the sweet ellinor on the temple she dropped senseless at once the other ladies cut her laces and the eager eyes of the queen were attracted by a small packet suspended to the black ribbon she always wore round her neck not even the surprising effect its contents took on the queen has ever enabled any one to guess at them color strength and speech for some moments forsook elizabeth when recovering her faculties she once more perused the memorials then deliberately tore them into atoms and summoning walsingham and burleigh all her attendants save the old lady latimer retired from the court ellinor was conveyed that night though by whom or whither is yet a secret love and friendship are however incessantly employed in her favor nor can her prison long remain so when once it is discovered were i to name the most ardent and anxious of her lovers i should surprise you but he shall only be known when with conscious pride he presents her to you and claims his reward  the profound policy elizabeth has always preserved with respect to lord leicester since his flight is far from being satisfactory to his friends she speaks of him only in an indifferent light and as if employed by herself while all that passed between them almost every body understands though no one dares to say so it seems indeed as if her rage had been diverted from him by another object i need not name her here alas how severely are you both revenged on the queen the galling chain from which she has at last enfranchised mary writhes round her own heart and if it would gratify you to see her tremble believe me you need only see her obliged to avow remorse to give an example in the severity of her mourning for a deed only her own will could have authorized she has the misery of knowing her murdered royal prisoner enthroned in heaven and embalmed in the tears of even her own people never more will elizabeth taste of peace for that indeed can only dwell with innocence  the full conviction elizabeth had incurred the abhorrence of all the world by this horrible infraction of the rights of royalty society and sex a little gratified my exquisite resentment yes sighed i heaven has invented a punishment proportionable to her crime counteracting by one stroke the policy of her whole life she has permitted herself to be known and of consequence execrated destined to survive her youth her virtue her fame and her happiness although encircled with a diadem her weary head shall vainly seek one faithful tender bosom to repose on those fiery passions so often destructive to others wanting now an object must prey upon the heart that conceals them till envying the glorious end as she ever did the distinguished bloom of mary stuart her fate is wound up in fears of her offspring in vain her cruel care would extirpate them every crime will but give birth to a new fear and the martyrdom of the queen of scots will multiply the causes of her terror since she now knows more than one child survives her  as the evening closed this billet was given me from my lord   the heart which has long bled by anticipation for your sorrow demands to partake it with you oh my sole love deny me not a share in your compassion fearful every moment i should lose the daughter the fate of the mother struggled with that grief in my soul nor durst i communicate it till concealment became impossible  i do not ask you to be comforted weep on my dear matilda but weep in my arms for what have i left in life if you forget to love me  this little billet happily calculated to awaken the softer passions drew forth my tears in great abundance i reproached myself with violence and unkindness let me not cried i while so severely lamenting one error be guilty of another lost to the duties the claims oh heaven that i should be so of a daughter those of a wife ought to assume a double influence yes chosen leicester i am yours am ever yours if this oppressed heart does not wholly dissolve in sorrow you will one day be again its only object and sacred from this moment be the rights of all united with me i collected my wild afflicted thoughts and raising them in prayer a blessed composure overcame the agitations of my mind passing into the next room where i heard my lord walking i threw myself into his arms oh you whom i have so fatally loved faltered i you who are now nearly my all fill up if possible every avenue to my heart and guard it from retrospection he answered not a word but pressing his cheek to mine our tears mingled  i see too plainly the truth the fatal truth said i recurring to lady arundells letter lovely illfated sister it was you then who accelerated our hapless mothers death that elizabeth knew me for a daughter of the stuart line she took a deadly means to certify but how she discovered it must ever have appeared miraculous without this letter i plainly perceive my sister indiscreetly wore the duplicate proof of our birth its dearest and best testimonial while mine is yet treasured in the secret cabinet at kenilworth and this in one moment destroyed her own peace and determined the fate of her mother oh most inexorable could thy vengeance demand more than one victim is then the daughter silently sacrificed on the lamented grave of her parent never more beloved sister of my blood and heart shall i behold thee never more draw comfort from thy sweet accents nor with thee pierce through the veil of futurity and catch gleams of golden days doubtless elizabeth imagines this the only authentic proof existing oh if in consequence of that opinion she touches the innocent life of ellinor i will offer incontestable evidence alike of marys marriage with norfolk and our birth at the foot of henrys throne he is famed for justice and generosity i am alas the helpless object of both the family of guise will unite to protect me perhaps all europe will aid too late the powerless king of scots and save him from feeling his impotence of royalty  unable entirely to share unwilling in the least to control my tender feelings for my family lord leicesters life could not at this period be called happy miss cecil again appeared our guardian angel as an intermediate person she felt for she soothed both till my irritated passions meliorated insensibly into sadness i began to listen to the flattering hopes continually instilled that my sister still lived and some fortunate event might yet restore her to us my lord was assured by the united testimony of his friends that elizabeth had no pretense for impeaching him and henry learnt with pleasure his design of fixing his residence in france thus again our peace seemed reestablished on a better foundation than it had yet been and i devoted my attention for the present solely to recompencing my lord for all he had renounced in my favor  overwhelmed with the repeated solicitations of lady mortimer i at last summoned resolution to set out for rouen from whence we had been supplied with every accommodation suitable to our rank that city having long been distinguished as the refuge of every noble exile my lord fixed on it for our residence my relation to lady mortimer ensured me every honor and lord leicesters name would soon form us a little court that crisis now approached very near which both considered with joy and terror and it appeared some relief to be in the care of a lady whose experience and tenderness might lessen my sufferings lord leicesters unwearied indulgence and anxious consideration every hour endeared him more to me and i gladly on reflection compounded with fortune for all her other severities since the first object of my heart was still unaltered  averse to being known ere we had formed a suite and selected a habitation he gave lady mortimer notice that we should not arrive till night as we past through the gates of rouen escorted by her train my heart beat high with the idea of meeting the sister of the noble norfolk the only being my own excepted allied in blood to me she met me at the entrance of a saloon i clasped her hands with emotion i wept upon i pressed them to my bosom she embraced me with extreme composure and holding me back a moment ran over my features and person with so keen a scrutiny as convinced me sensibility was not her characteristic while due compliments passed between miss cecil my lord and her i in turn indulged myself with an examination her person was fullsized tall and graceful like all the family of howard her features visibly marked both by age and decayed beauty her dress simple being like my own of mourning and her manners strongly conveyed the idea of magnificence dignity tinctured with austerity marked her conversation and i felt to my great regret i had gained a relation without winning a friend two monks to whom she paid a profound deference an old officer of the mortimer family and his sister were introduced to us as persons entitled to share our secret and we saw it indeed lodged with them ere our consent was demanded lord leicester was struck disagreeably at this discovery but struggled with his pride and affected good humor while finding myself after all my dangers under a roof sanctified by alliance and where my lord seemed restored to his proper sphere pleasure dilated my whole soul and i sat down to a sumptuous entertainment prepared on the occasion with an appetite i had long wanted  she avoided in consideration of my state and fatigues entering into our affairs and brought her own before us with a kind freedom assured us of the friendship of her eldest son lord mortimer who preferred the pleasure of liberty in both his religion and actions by serving in the wars of france to seeking a precarious fortune in england under an enemy to the pope the landed property once the inheritance of the mortimers her lord had prudently disposed of ere the return of philip to spain in whose service he had ever continued and that monarch famed as he was for meanness and ingratitude had shown a signal sense of the attachment by a grant to her youngest son of a considerable portion of land in jamaica which he had cultivated under such indulgences as made it every day more valuable his marriage with a spanish lady had united him more firmly to their government and interests but having lately had the misfortune of losing his wife he had yielded to the entreaties of his mother to visit france and was hourly expected occupied with her own narration she no longer remembered i was weary miss cecil however reminded her of the hour and we were conducted to a magnificent apartment  lord leicester slightly touched on the little disgust he had justly conceived and indulged a drowsiness which i could not immediately partake new objects had awakened my fancy and invaded my rest images more pleasing than had blessed me since the moment i had quitted kenilworth castle enlivened my soul yes my leicester said i softly grasping the hand of my sleeping love for me thou shall no more be endangered and degraded beyond the reach of our enemies we may now laugh at all their impotent malice ah vain and presumptuous a deadly snare was at that moment winding round my heart and a punishment prepared which pierced it through the bosom of security alas madam this night of promised peace proved the era in my life and became so by a misfortune which absorbed the sense of every other how how shall i recall the scene and preserve recollection enough to paint it dropping into that soft lethargy which foreruns sleep  ah why had i not been buried in the deepest but i was born the fate of all i ever loved it was my peculiar misery to raise the hand which cut them off from all but my memory and oh to weep through life the errors of too soft a heart  sinking as i have already said into slumber i fancied i heard a noise in the room  starting up with a fear habit made almost intuitive i awakened lord leicester who instantly drawing aside the curtain i discerned with inexpressible horror by the pale light of a lanthorn many men surrounding the bed with levelled arms while one with an imperious voice called out to him to surrender to the queen of england at that fatal sound my very soul recoiled but my lord not deigning to answer drew a sword always laid under his pillow and haughtily commanded them to leave the chamber the men advancing he aimed at the one nearest him who by instantly retreating jarred the arm of his companion the flash of death the tremendous sound the falling of the sword  all all confirmed in a moment my fate  lord leicester the worshipped of my soul  my all on earth  alas almost my all in heaven sunk into my weak arms in a last convulsion  that which at the appointed period will annihilate nature can alone surpass the impression of the moment terrible too was the confusion of these wretches at so unforeseen an event the faint light they carried gleamed over those features so adored he tremulously raised my hand to his lips and gave up his soul in silence on my bosom  but who shall speak the misery of my mind precipitated like the offending angels at once from heaven to hell an awful silence took place of lamentation oh it was a woe too mighty for complaint insensible to fear i at length desperately urged his murderers once more to unite those they had thus separated i bathed my bosom in the blessed crimson which still flowed from his and called alike on heaven and man to end me alas the only object of my hopes my fears my cares my wishes was congealing before the eyes of the forlorn wretch condemned to survive him the entrance of lady mortimer wrought grief up to phrenzy and for many days gave that relief to all my agonies  reason dawned upon my disordered soul like light through chaos a dim remembrance of what i had been preceded that of what i was faintly i recognized even the weak hand with which i drew back the curtain i found myself in a narrow cell lighted only through an obscure casement of painted glass intuitively my lips pronounced the name of leicester  in vain  nothing but my own voice returned upon my ear and the lonely dungeon in which i beheld myself enclosed overwhelmed me with so deadly a chillness that the shutting of my eyes appeared a degree of relief thought rose tumultuously on thought till in one moment the terrible whole flashed upon my mind i seemed once more in that magnificent bed which from the peaceful asylum of love an instant converted into the bier of death  once more i caught that last last look indelibly impressed  and felt once more my heart congeal with the lifeblood which sprung in torrents from his i started up once more in wild despair and wringing my hands groaned forth his name in accents so piercing that they roused the withered attendant allotted me from her undiscovered palletbed at the foot of mine hurrying toward me she muttered something i did not understand heavens cried i surveying her habit in amazement for till then i had never seen a nun where am i surely in the recess and the grave has given up its former inhabitants for my relief and comfort  jesu marie cried she in french which i very imperfectly understood will this poor thing never recover her senses ah no added i answering myself that fatal language confirms every dire recollection inform me you who are i know not why interwoven in my fate where where is my lord if all that flashes over my soul be but a wandering of intellect and he yet lives she cast down her eyes muttering yes my poor child you are sensible by that question vain vain hope cried i bursting into tears and returning to my native tongue yet oh alive or dead he is the all i require restore him but restore him a dear a sacred duty attaches me even to his ashes lead me to them since they are all now left me and allow me to lament at leisure she shrugged up her shoulders implying she did not thoroughly comprehend my language and crossing herself denounced eternal perdition on me if i longer thought of a heretic who seduced me from the true faith and who of consequence became a dreadful example of vengeance charging me to adore the holy virgin mother who had by so gentle a punishment recalled me to the catholic church yes sainted leicester in the infatuation of her bigotry she dared to term thy death a gentle punishment indignation throbbed through those pulses grief had nearly stilled and i gave vent to all the anguish of my soul abjured with an aggravated contempt the erroneous faith of my ancestors bewailed too late the credulity inspired by my own  execrated the cruel the treacherous lady mortimer and demanded my liberty with a spirit that perplexed and surprised the nuns alas i perceived at the same moment by the increasing number who now gathered round my bed how vain either threats or entreaties must prove in that instance the superior approached and in an authoritative decisive voice informed me lady mortimer in right of her relationship had placed me entirely under their care and protection relying on their pious endeavors both for the recovery of my reason and my principles nor could i make so good a use of the first as to apply it solely to the recovery of the latter instead of idly lamenting a loss which alone could have preserved my soul they called the noble husband of whom their illiberal tenets had just deprived me an heretic an outcast of society a wretch not worthy interment i heard without replying but my soul was not silent i appealed to the most high and he will not forget me oh in the awful day of retribution dreadfully will he distinguish the bigoted dictators in religion  happily for me they understood less of my language than i did of theirs which perhaps saved me from a harshness which must have added the ruin of my constitution to that of my peace  you will be astonished madam at my surviving such unceasing complicated misfortunes and above all the loss of my beloved i regard it myself with wonder and impute my strength both of body and mind solely to the knowing no pause in my sufferings driven from one fatigue to another from one agony to another lamentation was continually suspended either by amazement or that necessity for exertion which gives a spring to all but the weakest minds and counteracts despondency grief i may affirm from sad experience cannot be fatal till it stills and condenses every other passion  left at last with only that miserable companion my own heart i ruminated at leisure deprived of lord leicester happiness revenge name fortune every charm in existence every right in society entombed alive ere the ashes of my lord were allotted a resting place i reviewed my whole fate with astonishment often wearied with suffering did i meditate giving up a life no longer endeared to me and quietly pursuing my souls better part alas the unborn cause of all my late dangers would still recall still hold me down to suffer yes precious remnant of my love sole pledge of past felicity last of the mighty dudley line sighed i i owe thee the painful blessing of existence i owe thy noble fathers memory justice i know the profound the execrable policy of elizabeth nor doubt her escaping the slightest censure unless i appear  and shall i shall i oh leicester living or dead forsake thee shall she who cost thee every worldly good allow thy honor thy fortune thy life to be annihilated without one effort to retrieve either no since revenge is the little all now left me let me secure that little disappoint oh god the weak and enthusiastic views of my unworthy relation permit me to convey from this unhallowed grave the honored ashes of my love let them overwhelm elizabeth with late contrition and fruitless shame and then oh then allow me to bequeathe to my trembling babe that life i no longer wish to groan under  to effect any part of these complicated designs i found it absolutely necessary to stifle in a degree my feelings and submitting to a dissimulation my soul abhorred i requested to see that woman who was more terrible to my eyes than any thing human elizabeth excepted this request flattered the nuns with the hope of my conversion and a little opened their hearts toward me i now learnt that the wretches who robbed my days of comfort imputed the event solely to accident nor pleaded a commission beyond conveying lord leicester to england and even that in so private a manner as showed them without legal authority  the whole had been conducted with so profound a secrecy that neither the design nor event had ever reached the knowledge of the police to prevent which the body of lord leicester had been immediately brought into an outer vault of the chapel of the convent where it had been embalmed ready to send over to england if such should be the pleasure of the queen which as it appeared was all they considered the jewels and money both lord leicester and myself possessed when we entered the fatal gates of rouen seemed to have departed with him as well as all information respecting the lodgment of those sums i have already mentioned and i saw myself for all that fortune once promised me inheriting only a weed  as i endured with patience the religious visitations and homilies of the nuns as well those of various monks who united with them in converting me lady mortimer in a few days consented to judge of their cares by seeing me this insolent woman considered the visit as a condescension and hardly held out a hand mine shuddered again to touch unmoved with my paleness my condition or my habit she calmly discoursed with the sisterhood and the monks while i continued drowned in tears no human effort could stifle a gentleman who i understood was her younger son addressed me with the voice of sympathy uninfluenced by his mothers pious prejudices he spoke of my misfortune as the first on earth and of lord leicester as the man who most deserved to be lamented and bewailed the delays in his passage which made him unhappily arrive too late to succor either he spoke too in english the words the manner the language sunk into my soul and a saint hope they struck out enabled me to support the ensuing conversation lady mortimer addressed me with an air at once tenacious and haughty treated me like a mere girl who to a blind and unpardonable passion had made perpetual sacrifices of every solid duty of religion and morality represented me as the sole cause of my mothers martyrdom a sin no penance could ever expiate mentioned with horror that union which wanting the sanction of the pope could not by her be termed a marriage and valued herself on the happy plan she had laid to separate us it appeared the information of our place of residence passed from her to elizabeth who bargained for the secret delivery of lord leicester to her emissaries a request lady mortimer complied with gladly as the easiest and most effectual means of reuniting me to the church the plan of seizing him at midnight had she owned been concerted by herself as that was a time when he could neither resist nor i follow him to create any alarm a circumstance she dreaded beyond any other thing from the bloody consequence of this treachery she affected to acquit herself though without expressing any sorrow on the occasion  oh negative sin groaned i inwardly oh dire collusion wanting courage to act an ill are you when preacquainted less guilty in not preventing it the laws of england reached not hither nor was lord leicester amenable by those laws wherefore entice and murder him beneath a roof alliance and hospitality should have doubly consecrated wherefore but that the commonest inn would have protected him tears and sighs being all my comments on her speech she joined the monks in elaborate exhortations in high promises of presenting me to all my mothers partisans and rendering me the head of the english catholic party whenever i voluntarily recanted my errors or if i persisted in them anticipating the judgment of heaven she resolved to punish my apostasy by an absolute seclusion within the walls which at present confined me faint and overcome i promised to deliberate and with difficulty obtained the only request i ventured  the sad indulgence of weeping over the coffin of lord leicester  i could hardly fail to discover through this veil of simulation pride and bigotry a strong selfinterest the agreement for delivering up lord leicester very highly offended those laws which protected lady mortimer and to which she must have answered had the intention only transpired but when to that was added his murder his midnight murder in a city chiefly composed of huguenots hardly dared she guess at her own danger the narrow faith which embosomed her among catholics proved in this instance her safety since united in her danger as well as principles they were resolved to venture the utmost to secure her every subsequent day confirmed my opinion and the absolute necessity of winning me over or entombing me alive made the nuns omit no care or indulgence after once i seemed to listen to them  fearful of rousing all my passions and reviving every prejudice by conducting me to the dreary unhallowed vault lord leicester was laid in and not daring to bring his sacrilegeous ashes within their own chapel the nuns amused themselves with decorating his sepulcher with all the pompous insignia of death  ah vain attempt to sadden anguish can midnight tapers suspended black or waving plumes relieve those eyes which seek in vain their only object or gratify a heart writhing under the iron hand of calamity can mortal prayers ensure immortal happiness or can selfsainted wretches bribe the almighty even with the ore his bounty lavishes preposterous blindness  such were my mental replies to all their enthusiastic harangues and this illchosen moment of assailing me only fixed my fluctuating religious principles on the coffin of lord leicester my secret soul pronounced a vow solemn and irrevocable to know no heaven but his nor seek it in another manner thou too oh most beloved were present  but not to me  no more my eyes were to imbibe pleasure from the lucid beams of thine  no more my soul was to mingle with thine effusions which so often had enabled me to sustain the malevolence of fortune ah no thou thou alone were by a strange transition become my sovereign grief and the cold lead which feared up dust so precious enclosed at the same moment the heart of thy sad widow  i had in vain enquired for miss cecil the nuns assured me they knew only from my delirium that such a person existed and lady mortimer inexorably refused to inform me whether she still did so deeply i lamented the loss of the only friend who could have soothed by sharing my affliction death had hallowed her passion with rights scarce inferior to my own and my heart too frequently felt none but those who loved could lament lord leicester as he merited  mr mortimer soon became the medium between me and his mother despairing to touch her impenetrable soul i employed every moment of loneliness in subduing her sons slowly i unfolded my views and slowly he too listened to them yet he did listen fearful that every hour would add a new inconvenience by the birth of that poor babe for whom i suffered such unremitting calamity and dubious whether the pious policy of the nuns might not snatch it as soon as born from my feeble arms as well to ensure my stay as my abjuration new terrors sprung up in my soul i could not but perceive an interested motive actuated him reduced however to owe my freedom to any thing i appeared blind to a tenderness every circumstance forbad him to avow a very few days determined him and he informed me he had secured an english vessel the crew of which were to be his only assistants how slowly is hope extinguished and oh how swiftly does it revive actuated with the most impatient desire of escaping i made even my grief subservient to it and proposed to the nuns periodically to watch in the vault with lord leicester a sad ceremony their religion permitted and mine did not forbid being told it would be easier to force a way into this than the interior parts of the convent mortimer had himself directed in conveying thither my departed love and allowed it to be an easy means of escape and perhaps the only one  i past part of several preceding nights in the same manner accompanied by different nuns to lull suspicion were it possible any should have arisen what quick what multiplied what various emotions foreran the appointed time every eye seemed to dive into my design and every heart seemed intent to counteract it i found it impossible to obtain the privilege of watching alone and shivered lest my deliverers should arive ere my pale companion was summoned or i should want strength to prevent her alarming the sisterhood fortunately the night proved severely cold and observing she was no sharer in my penance i recommended to her to retire to her cell and rejoin me when the mattins were over disgusted with her employment and already frostnipt she sullenly complied and left me alone with the coffin of lord leicester  lost husband of my choice oh ever dear and ever lamented sighed i kneeling before and invoking the senseless lead not for herself is thy matilda thus anxious to vindicate thy honor to preserve the precious earth which once was part of thee and that which will soon become so is all the use she now can make of freedom an awful silence which seemed only interrupted by the throbbing of my pulses succeeded regardless of all those emblems of death which harrow up the minds of the happy i knew no fear but of the living the bell struck upon my heart the decisive twelve a jarring in the farthest vault reached my ear another opened i heard the feet of men another yet i was environed by my deliverers and one spark of pleasure ran through my cold frame as i raised my head from the coffin of lord leicester fly fair matilda cried the impatient mortimer snatching my hand to raise me  stay generous friend and hear me said i with firmness you rescue only half of me if you leave the ashes of my lord behind would you part a miser from his treasure rather will he be massacred upon it there is enclosed the whole of mine bear that likewise away or entomb me with it for never i swear by him in whose presence we were united never will i alive or dead consent to part with him offended at so unexpected a demand he urged the difficulty and the danger with a harshness i thought him incapable of nevertheless the place and time allowed not of long deliberation and finding me inflexible he at last ordered the sailors to convey away the coffin likewise an order they only complied with from taking the metaphorical phrase i had used of a treasure in a literal sense attached to lord leicester beyond mortality i always felt protected when he was present and with ceaseless care watched my deliverers convinced they would be but too ready to leave so great an encumbrance behind  they bore me with swiftness to the banks of the seine where a boat waited and the tide favoring we soon reached a ship of considerable burden which weighed anchor immediately agitated with a thousand remembrances that of mortimer hardly occurred to me till the vessel was under fail and i still perceived him on board i had ever understood he was to leave me as soon as i was placed in safety i reminded him of this promise i will leave you fairest of women cried he eagerly grasping my hand when you are placed in safety if you still are cruel enough to desire it but can i quit you now or venture to set foot in a country where i have for your sake violated the most sacred law and exposed myself to condign punishment i should have found reason enough in this answer but that his stifled shortbreathed joy his ungovernable ardor impressed my secret soul with terror and robbed freedom of all comfort  i found in the cabin to which he conducted me a woman allotted to attend me who strongly recommended that repose my fate had long denied the misfortunes from which i had escaped united with those that still threatened me to fill my whole soul and willing to avert the fearful anticipation i entered into some common discourse with my attendant i found with infinite astonishment that she was a midwife and provided with every necessary for the expected babe i should have considered this as the most tender obligation but that a fatal doubt had sprung up in my heart and suspended every generous emotion alas it soon matured into certainty the vain and eternal fondness which made me insist on having the coffin of lord leicester placed in the cabin allotted for me at first seemed to inspire in mortimer that horror common to weak or guilty minds at sight of such an awful memento a few days rendered it familiar to him a passion he no longer concealed led him for ever into my presence neither the unburied dead the black which seemed to envelop my withered heart as well as form nor the sad circumstances in which i was widowed any longer operated on his imagination i too plainly perceived he considered me as his own and only waited my recovery to avow his unwarranted pretensions what dire vicissitudes of fear did my timid soul experience i saw myself entirely in the power of this man forlorn of every human aid hopeless helpless save in the mercy of the almighty  oh thou supreme sighed i hourly raising my streaming eyes to heaven thou whose omniscient breath rolls on this mighty world of waters oh grant that they may prove my safety or my grave  a little gallery ran before my cabin whither i sometimes went for air devoured with reveries like those recapitulated i one evening found them interrupted by the voice of a woman singing the elegance of her manner and the sweetness of her tone convinced me it could not be my coarse attendant nor did i know the ship contained another female save myself wrapped in astonishment and curiosity every sense subsided into ear i recognized a favorite hymn a hymn so swelling solemn and sublime that my charmed soul pursued the subject almost to heaven she changed to death  one tone one deep one dirgelike tone struck on my vibrating heart and almost silenced every pulse a loud cry with the name of rose burst from me  the noise of a person falling succeeded and the singing ceased i ran wildly up to the deck and loudly demanded my long lost friend of the astonished mortimer confused beyond the power of deceiving me he opened a cabin immediately over my own ah with what tumultuous emotions did i raise the muchloved muchlamented partner of my fate slowly she recovered from the stupor surprise had occasioned a thousand remembrances endeared the pleasure of the reunion as many annihilated all sense of pleasure embraces and tears at length subsided as soon as alone i questioned her concerning the interval the dire decisive interval  waked by the universal confusion said the fair rose with bitter sobs which succeeded the fatal accident of the night that parted us i demanded you my friend with frantic ardor but in vain a man i soon understood to be the son of lady mortimer who was concealed in the house when we arrived shortly after entered my apartment and ordered others who attended him to convey me on board the ship which brought him from jamaica tears and entreaties were fruitless and in the dead of night i was conducted to the banks of the seine and rowed to this vessel in which i found myself imprisoned without the least hope of meeting you i soon learnt from the coarse jests of the sailors that their owner was an unprincipled villain in all respects and more especially where women was concerned every hope of an escape was finally taken from me by my having the illfortune to attach the captain whom fear of mortimer alone has kept within bounds i understood the vessel was bound for jamaica and only waited to take in a new cargo nevertheless i saw that completed without our setting sail and hoped from this the hand of providence would yet interpose in my favor alas little did i imagine it was involving you in the same hopeless desperate situation  judge then oh most unfortunate concluded the amiable miss cecil what fate awaits us both  rescued from the licentious wishes of your cousin his worthless heart has only exchanged its object and resigns me as the more ignoble prey to his more worthless companion the little decency mortimer has hitherto preserved toward you this miserable meeting will finally put an end to he now knows you are infallibly apprized of your destination and how will you form your mind to it the island to which we are bound is yet in the hands of a few settlers power is almost their only law and he doubtless does not want that since he ventures to defy every other never more shall my aching eyes discern the safe the pleasant shores of england those shores they joyed to lose sight of  alas they then were fixed upon an object offended heaven has punished me by claiming  how how should we resist the numbing power of desperation did not the sacred sense of devotion mostly spring from it and lift the soul above humanity although more deplorably circumstanced myself by a courageous effort i resolved to soothe and console her and gently preparing her tender heart for the fatal object it was destined to encounter i led her down to my cabin ah what affection streamed equal from our hearts and eyes upon the cold memento  miss cecil judged too truly and the infamous mortimer no longer deigned to veil his views perpetually shocking me with free and haughty declarations of his passion it was but too obvious he knew his power and considered his intention of marrying me as the most honorable distinction even at the moment he scoffed at every one custom or nature had established miss cecil was not less importuned by a wretch rough as the element by which he subsisted and both so regularly visited our cabin that scarce could we call it our own even at the hours sacred to repose in those eternal conflicts such a situation must cause despair would too often prevail and silently with dubious eyes we fathomed the abyss of waters on which we floated considering it as the last terrible asylum  in the midst of these horrors the appointed hour revolved and nature made her agonizing effort in that awful moment i lost every sensation of fear and resigned myself into the hands of my creator beseeching him to recall the troubled soul which so long had groaned before him with that of the tender babe whose first feeble cries pierced my every sense as soon as my weakness allowed they gave into my arms a girl a dear a fatherless girl who seemed at her first entrance into existence to bewail her unknown calamity an impulse new exquisite unexpected took possession of my soul an impulse so sweet so strong so sacred it seemed as i had never loved till then feebly straining her to my bosom i enthusiastically prayed the almighty to bestow on her every blessing she had innocently wrested from me while my fond heart baptized her in its tears powerful powerful nature how did i worship all thy ordinations no fate can be wrought up to such a height of happiness but some interwoven sorrow chastens us with the sad sense of imperfection nor any so steeped in misery but some celestial ray streams through this frail mansion of mortality subliming all its sufferings  while my eager eyes gazed unwearied on my newborn cherub and traced in her infant lineaments her fathers matchless beauty even till they ached with fondness fancy pierced through the veil of futurity to unite each grace of person and of mind and enduing her with all every human claim upon my feelings seemed condensed and revived in this new one oh hope sweet substitute for happiness whose mental gildings dawn periodically upon the soul like light upon creation awakening and invigorating every active principle of being recalled by this irresistible influence even from the dark the dreary grave each troubled heart arises and shaking off the heavy dews of sorrow slowly resumes its wonted habits the pale converts of experience no longer dare appropriate the darling object of their wishes but meekly then receive the appointed pleasure prepared alike either to enjoy or to resign it as thus the maternal tie engrafted itself in my soul i perpetually endeavored to impress that of my dear unfortunate friend with the same train of ideas alas in vain  rather surprised at finding me sensible of consolation than disposed to receive it she gradually withdrew a confidence i did not easily miss and delivered herself up to that cold and sullen despair which unsettles every principle entreaties and arguments soon lost all effect on her starting at times from an impenetrable reverie a broken sigh would overturn all i could urge while continued adjurations produced too often a marked disgust obliged at intervals to quit the cabin lest even my present situation should fail to protect it from intruders and listen to the hateful addresses of her boisterous lover often did the seat of reason appear shaken in this dear unfortunate on her return and a vague and extravagant gaiety would suddenly give place to the deepest gloom and inanity i saw these fluctuations with horror and dreaded the moment when a rude demand of marriage should bring her fate to a climax ah not without reason did i dread it one evening after a conversation of this kind i perceived her more than usually disturbed neither my prayers nor the pouring rain could bring her from the balcony where for hours she told her weary steps i started at last from a momentary slumber on her reentering the cabin the dim lamp burning in it showed her with a slow and tottering pace approaching the last asylum of lord leicester sinking by this repository of her breaking heart she clasped her hands upon her bosom with a most speaking sense of woe while over it her fair locks fell wild and dishevelled heavy with the midnight rain and shivering to its beatings the wet pery of her white garments spread far over the floor and combined to from so perfect an image of desolation as froze up all my faculties i struggled for articulation a feeble cry alone escaped me she started at the sound from her icy stupor and glanced her eyes every where with that acuteness of perception which marks a disturbed imagination then with a long sigh sunk once more into herself a second cry followed by her name my bounding eager heart pronounced she half arose the motion of her lips seemed contending with the drear silence of the moment but not a murmur broke it  amazement horror the wrings of death transfixed me springing up with etherial lightness even while her feeble frame shivered with agony and affection she fixed on my convulsed features a long long look then waving majestically a last adieu rushed again into the balcony unable to move a limb my harrowed soul seemed through the jar of the elements to distinguish her dreadful plunge into the world of waters a something too mighty to describe or endure came over me and sense fled before it  how long it was ere my careless attendant came to my relief i know not but a succession of fits accompanied with dangerous shudderings and a raging fever seemed every moment to promise me from the ordination of providence that relief my lost rose had ventured to precipitate whether her fatal example or my sufferings influenced my tyrant his persecution entirely subsided in the short intervals of reason my weakness produced he condemned his own conduct bound himself by the most solemn promises to convey me home and conjured me to struggle for life if not for my own sake at least for that of my infant alas my babe when my cheek felt once more thy tender breathings i accused myself for wishing to leave thee and acknowledged the sad necessity of living my cruel malady robbing the cherub of her natural sustenance it was with difficulty she received any other and the proposal he made me of having her baptized was readily accepted that ceremony was performed the same evening alas my precious infant no velvet pillowed thy innocent face no costly canopies preserved it no noble sponsors with ready arms contended to receive thee no fathers blessing followed that of heaven thou were alas given by a sordid nurse to a more sordid chaplain and by a dim lamp within a narrow cabin thy woeful mother raised her feeble head to see the child of lord leicester a daughter of the house of stuart consecrated by the name of mary  recovered a little from the effects as well as the impression caused by the unhappy catastrophe of my darling friend i could not fail to adore that gracious providence with whose decrees she had dared to blend her own on learning that the insolent captain had on that fatal evening by a fall broke both his arms and lost the power of molesting her at first this appeared a bitter aggravation but soon it sunk into my soul and regulated all my future conduct never ah never from that moment have i ventured to yield to rashness and despair but when unable to obey i have resolved to endure how severely has this principle been tried how often when overweighed by the heavy hand of misfortune have i been obliged to interpose between myself and my fate the fleeting form of the beauteous cecil escaping my helpless will and rushing uncalled into eternity  the vain hope of returning to england with which mortimer had flattered me into health daily diminished the alteration of the air united with the discourse of the mariners to prove the period of my disastrous voyage approached i heard the fond the universal shout and that sweet emotion sailors only feel at sight of land agitated every heart but mine averse and gloomy i turned my hopeless eyes toward a shore where natures lavish hand had spread a fertility which seemed to scorn the aid of art ah where are now the barren hills the chalky cliffs of england sighed i in silence i perceived st jago de la vega the only town then on the island and in the idea of interesting the governor i rested my last hope i knew not that eager to possess the abundant conveniences my tyrant had brought over i should escape the notice of the inhabitants or be considered as living lumber not worth enquiry confined within the narrow bounds of my own cabin i had the mortification of hearing the cannon and music proclaim the arrival and departure of the governor and officers after partaking a sumptuous entertainment and on the same evening while intoxication secured the chief people of the island in their own houses i was landed and put into a litter which the slaves of mortimer bore toward his plantations the few idlers whom curiosity drew round me disregarded my adjurations and with cold insolence examined my features their remarks were made in a language i did not understand and i plainly discerned they did not wish to understand mine i too late recollected my being unveiled might make them form a false judgment of my character meek by nature and bowed to the earth by misfortune i lost all power of contending with my fate and supplicating only the almighty awaited its dire completion i perceived it was not without reason mortimer had boasted of his authority with overbearing insolence he now demanded my hand and bade me remember he was there a sovereign nor did i see a being who dared even to murmur at his will he presumed to rally the anguish he occasioned and even sacrilegiously to insult the cold remains of that adored husband whose rights he seemed every moment ready to violate imagination had long since been exhausted in seeking means of redress flight was impossible in a country where i neither knew the roads the natives nor whether it supplied an individual willing or able to protect me many of his spanish domestics i was not permitted to see those that were allowed to approach me appeared haughty repelling and silent i soon found they compounded with their pride for the servile exactions of duty paid to him by lording it equally over his slaves who timid by nature and subdued by cruelty seemed to have lost the very wish of any other good than that of existence  tears sighs and refusals could no longer avert or even delay the sacrifice and having only a few hours of solitude allowed to prepare my mind for the ceremony i hushed my smiling babe at my aching breast and wearied alike with misery and prayer dropped into a slumber a dream represented me in the position i really was  sunk on the ground near the coffin of lord leicester suddenly i perceived the lid was removed i started up impatient to behold the chosen of my heart i saw him once more though wrapped in the garments of the grave  once more i saw rich life mantling on that manly cheek and those fine eyes mine never beheld without pleasure once more beamed brightness upon me surprised entranced i made a thousand ineffectual efforts to speak and holding out my newborn mary i saw oh sweet though vain delusion a fathers arms enfold her my senses seemed unequal to the ecstacy impenetrable darkness spread over my eyes and a burst of ethereal music absorbed every faculty recovering all however instantaneously i looked upward alas lord leicester was ascending with his daughter in his arms i demanded her with agonizing cries and catching at a mantle which yet seemed within my reach it fell upon me like the crash of nature burying me under an immovable weight i awakened at the moment it is but a dream cried my scared heart but such a dream as the horrors of the approaching moment alone could counterpoise  scarce had i recalled my shook senses when mortimer attended by his chaplain and domestics entered my apartment while the latter were decorating it with catholic pomp i summoned the small remains of my courage to address the priest who stood ready to mock the religion he professed  by that awful god to whom you are consecrated hear me cried i sinking at his feet and oh that he may graciously impress upon your heart the sad protest of mine by barbarous hands at once widowed and betrayed it is no longer possible for every human power combined to make me happy you you alone may make me wholly miserable if to complete those manifold evils which the almighty for ends i cannot judge of has permitted me to survive with the violation of every right both of religion and morality can be called marriage and you as the delegate of heaven dare sacrilegiously to pronounce the ceremony i stand here a devoted wretch the hopeless helpless victim of my duty but mark i adjure you my last declaration i have a will which circumstances can neither alter or bend  delivered up to this abandoned man it is in his power to make me any thing but his wife and against that title my soul will ever revolt and my last breath protest  unhappy deluded young creature returned the sordid priest in french were my conseience to prevent this marriage it would be from a different motive than those you adjure me by and such is the horror your obstinate heresy inspires that did i not hope time end a better husbands cares would convert your erring heart hardly would i venture to unite you with a member of our holy church  submit yourself at once to your fate imperiously said mortimer for to end your hopes of the churchs interposing in your favor i will frankly acknowledge she put you into my power i turned my hands as well as eyes in speechless astonishtiment toward heaven hope not my fair cousin rejoined he with a malicious smile your sentimental innocence can cope with the arts of a sisterhood of nuns wearied with your obstinacy fearful of your escape they gladly put you into my power to ensure their own safety he paused  my mind took in at once the dreadful truth  my innocence ah rather say ignorance groaned i mentally that fatal error which too severely punishes itself  hardly ever can i pardon myself the extravagant credulity scarce could my mother persuade me resumed he that you would be duped by so obvious a collusion since a single moments reflection must have convinced you never man pervaded the last retreat of disappointed women but by their own connivance and all the precious mummery of the business but heightened the pleasure of the triumph how could i fail to smile to see the coffined spouse borne in the train of the living one who proudly clasped a timid heart which knew not then it throbbed against its masters alike unable to utter or suppress the burning indignation this unmanly boast this elaborate wickedness excited i fixed my eyes inflexibly on the coffin of lord leicester almost believing heaven itself would effect a miracle in my favor by renovating my only protector the ceremony nevertheless commenced when a new event transfixed not only me but every person present a yell wild deep shrill and horrible was succeeded by a tumult universal and tremendous the paleness of death crept upon the cheeks of my late inhuman tyrant who with his confederates turned around his hopeless eyes for some instrument of defense in vain impelled by desperation they all rushed out but were instantly driven back by the tide of exasperated slaves appalled by their ferocious eyes and bloody hands i sunk into a swoon but revived as it were by heavens appointment to see the last the deadly blow given to mortimer who reeling a few paces groaned his last on the coffin of lord leicester thus signally and memorably avenged surrounded with death in every horrid form i expected continually the completion of my destiny which i had certainly found but that a spaniard who was united in the plot of the slaves with the gallantry incident to his nation protected me in consequence of my sex and wrongs and led me away to their rendezvous assuring me i should there find safety terror almost annihilated my faculties as the ferocious slaves ran backward and forward heaping in these huts the bloody plunder new murders every moment secured having gathered together all they thought it expedient to save they loaded the horses and each other hastening to secret themselves in those woods which by narrow passes led to impenetrable retreats in the mountains many were the unintelligible disputes concerning me many a halfraised arm and inflamed eye glared death upon me but the stroke was as eagerly averted by the interposition of the generous emanuel yet perhaps his utmost interest had been unequal to the occasion but that one of the slaves they called aimor seemed suddenly won over to my party he was among the ringleaders of this conspiracy and his decision silenced every murmur horses were so precious that emanuel could only procure me one by resigning to his confederates his share of the plunder which it had been allotted him to convey  fury now began to give place to fear and the guilty wretches hastened their departure the march commenced about midnight silent bewildered awestruck i had meditated on this succession of terrible events without extending my views beyond the present moment and scarce dared look toward the future to see myself and infant led away thus suddenly into slavery by a wild and unknown people feared by the oppressions of their murdered master to all sense of humanity through a country alike wild and unknown exposed to the insults of two newmade lovers and only safe in the guard they kept over each other how strange the transition in my fate i yet bent my soul to the power who by such exemplary justice released me from mortimer and thought every other evil less than being confirmed his wife since that alone was without any remedy but death  ere we had made any considerable progress in our fearful journey the rolling clouds became tinctured with a vivid crimson and my companions were seized with the consternation incident to guilt notwithstanding they had used every precaution to conceal their ravages on the spot from whence they had escaped till out of the reach of danger some unextinguished spark had caught fire and extending through the range of buildings i saw the rich though ravaged possessions of mortimer one universal conflagration the apprehension this diffused through the midnight wanderers gave place in me to a nearer and more affecting remembrance sad and silent tears streamed down my cheeks when i considered the whole riches of his base rival formed but the funeral pile of lord leicester farewell a long farewell sighed forth my oppressed soul oh most beloved oh most avenged whatever fate heaven shall appoint thy persecuted widow humbly let her obey the god who so signally interred thee  alas a few hours and no memorial of thy existence will remain except that poor babe who feebly trembles to the beatings of her mothers heart no faithful hand shall separate the ashes of the injurer and the injured yet let me not complain since the fiat of the almighty shall awfully adjudge the souls this fearful moment enlarges  as emanuel still walked by me i sought from him to understand the cause of the present insurrection and the different motives of himself and companions those of the slaves said that generous protector are like their natures wild and various  my own simply justice and love the tyrannic mortimer whose fate no being will ever deplore established himself in this island no less by the favor of philip the second than by marrying the sister of the present governor don pedro de sylva in that nobleman he met a kindred mind mean mercenary oppressive and cruel in one particular alone they differed mortimer was by nature bold and enterprizing don pedro cautious and timid the enormities of the first however always found shelter in the injustice of the latter and don pedro not daring to carry on in his own person that piratical and illicit trade which alone can enrich individuals in the infancy of a settlement secretly shared with his brotherinlaw the purchase and the profit while mortimer was the only ostensible person had any legal enquiry arisen the arrogance cruelty and vanity of mortimer received a fatal increase by the accumulation of wealth and set him above all restraint don pedro conscious he was in his power ventured not to question much less punish his conduct the intervals between his frequent voyages destroyed the peace and shortened the days of donna victoria the uncomplaining victim of her brothers and husbands rapacious league i came with her into the family as her major domo a post which rendering me a witness of the brutality of mortimer soon turned the disgust he generally inspired into hatred i was the foster brother of victoria and attached to her by a reverence so profound that i insensibly adopted her wrongs as my own ungoverned and licentious in every instance but more especially when women were the objects force generally was employed by mortimer where fraud failed to succeed and those domestics alone held rank in his family who were readily subservient to his gross and vicious pursuits my views died with my lady and i should gladly have quitted him to return to spain but that he meanly retained a considerable sum i had been provident enough to save as well as a legacy donna victoria had bequeathed me every complaint or even solicitation for my own was silenced with the most haughty threats of perpetual imprisonment a sentence i often saw inflicted for no greater fault nor could i ever hope to quit the island as the consent of the governor depended on that of mortimer the sense of undeserved oppression thus corroded my very soul and prepared me for the incident which at last nerved my arm against the tyrant  meanwhile the base accomplices of his pleasures and his crimes assumed a sovereignty over the miserable slaves which they exercised till invention was exhausted in cruelty and oppression in vain my nature shrunk at the sight of calamities i knew not how to remedy unable to quit the island or recover my money two years elapsed in fruitless and sometimes desperate projects i saw the persecuted slaves ripe for rebellion and only waiting a favorable moment to rise and sacrifice their train of oppressors and though i did not purpose to join the confederacy i concealed it with a sullen satisfaction till the day which at once determined my conduct need i say it was that which brought you thither when i saw you alike irradiated by innocence and beauty led into those unhallowed walls  when i saw the tear of misfortune fall on your beauteous babe like the springs chaste dews upon the early blossom i was persuaded your nature intuitively shuddered at the monster and i swore to preserve you at the hazard of my life nay even at the moment hope should be annihilated in your heart i joined at once in the conspiracy the hands were ready the head alone had been wanting by various artifices i procured arms for the slaves and fixed the insurrection on the day appointed for your marriage as that on which mortimer and his favorites would be wholly occupied and of course unguarded the hand of heaven surely guided all our operations the various villains have atoned as far at least as life can atone for their complicated iniquities but alas madam i did not sufficiently look into consequences it is dangerous to arm the enraged and the ignorant i know too late your life and mine depends on a frail tenure and only solemnly assure you while mine lasts yours shall be safe these uninformed desperate wretches with whom we are surrounded are not the simple happy beings injurious tyranny first found them inflicted cruelty has hardened their hearts and the sight of untasted luxuries corrupted them their own wants have increased with the knowledge of other peoples enjoyments and what they greatly desire they have learnt to go any lengths to attain why should i conceal from you that your only prospect of safety is the hope of being overtaken though that to me is inevitable ruin the fatal fire therefore which now these entangling woods almost hides from us is of all the wonders of the late evening the most visible interposition of heaven in your favor  the nobility of sentiment incident to the spanish nation especially in whatever relates to the softer sex prevented that surprise so romantic as generosity must otherwise have occasioned to gratify a request made with the highest respect i entered into a recital of my own hapless story aimor with jealous care adhered to that side of my horse not guarded by emanuel and not comprehending a word of the language in which i spoke depended on his rival for translating it who no doubt gave it every construction most favorable to his own views the information that i was the daughter of a queen ran through the troop and softened their ferocity but soon on that pompous distinction were grounded vain hopes of some imaginary good they were all to derive from me  from me who was in fact the most helpless and unprotected of all the miserable wanderers  i pondered much on emanuels remark that my safety could only be ascertained from our being overtaken but when i considered the desperate state of all with me should that happen hardly dared i hope it still we journeyed onward through woods the stars of heaven could scarcely penetrate and when i recollected the frightful wilds and mountains beyond them in which myself and babe must infallibly be buried for life how did my heart die within me but when to that fear was added the dread of evils yet more horrible hardly could my senses support the oppression aimor i was convinced would not want the aid of his whole party and how could i hope one generous individual would be able to struggle with a tide of combining foes but even if emanuel had the address to manage them all would not expectations in his own favor hardly less fearful to my thoughts arise in his heart through the chill windings of the desert woods i raised my soul to him whose eye pervades alike the gloom of midnight and the blaze of noon and something seemed to assure my sinking spirits he rescued me not from the horrors of the recess thus to abandon me  i did not err in that devout confidence the dawn of day obliging the body to be more guarded in their march they chose a lone hollow and halted to send forth scouts and refresh themselves alas i sighed for the poor wretches who seduced by european crimes to a dire imitation of them had wanted foresight to procure themselves the common comforts which alone render life endurable though overwhelmed with gaudy trifles they knew not how to enjoy  the temporary calm into which they sunk was fearfully interrupted the scouts sent out pressed back with immediate notice that they were intercepted and so hemmed in that it was impossible to proceed a mile farther though by this notice my own safety was ascertained my very soul partook the misery of my companion the wretched women threw their arms for the last time round their despairing husbands and bathed them with tears so bitter as might wash out the stains of blood yet recent the men thus totally devoted with a stern and unaltered brow seized their arms and resolved to rush upon the broken parties gracing their own death by making the loss equal to their enemies even some of their wives rendered furious by the occasion followed with such scattered weapons as they could collect and the rest no less tamed gathered themselves and hapless children round me as if i could preserve them pursuing their friends with a cry might shake the throne of mercy aimor and emanuel cast a lingering eye toward the foot of that tree at which i sat apparently the queen of sorrow it was dreadful to make a visible distinction at that moment and perhaps embitter their last laying my babe upon my lap i tendered a hand to each the boon was eagerly accepted even the savage became humanized an impassioned tear fell on the hand that shuddered at his touch while emanuel more gracefully obsequious bowed to the earth then over the offered hand and removing his ardent eye from my face to that of his rival  adieu most worshipped of women cried the gallant spaniard adieu for ever how many evils does death save us all from  during the horrible interval of blood and slaughter i endeavored to close my ears to the sound of the firing which was echoed by the agonized groans of the wretches around me the conflict was short and bands of europeans pierced through those shades where a few minutes had made so many helpless widows those guilty but unfortunate women prostrating themselves before the presented pieces endeavored by the most submissive gestures and offers of their children to assuage the wrath of the incensed victors i feebly arose likewise and pressing forward to the apparent leader astonished him with the sight of a white among the survivors i exhausted my little remaining strength in soliciting protection for myself and child and pity for my companions he heard without comprehending me his very soul was intently fixed on the scattered riches this reduction of the slaves put into his hands and neither myself my daughter or my fate seemed an object worth regard the whole party busily employed themselves in collecting the valuables of every kind and afterward taking into consideration the human plunder fortune once more restored to them they drove off the female slaves and their children bending beneath the weight of misery fatigue and manacles  emerging from the depth of those unwholesome woods through which i had wandered i lifted my eyes devoutly toward that rising orb which seems no less to give light to the mind than the creation and called on the pleasing prospect of the future to counteract the horrible impressions of the past restored by this extraordinary means once more to civilized society my heart acknowledged the charm the simple the solitary charm of liberty and springing forward toward england overleaped every intervening obstacle convinced by fatal experience at once of the fragility of human happiness and the persecutions to which natures dearest gifts too often expose us the bright forms of love ambition and glory vanished leaving no image for my fancy to rest on but content i saw her meek eye lifted to her heavenborn sister resignation whose hallowed beams streamed through her earthy cottage impearling every tear and my soul sighed after the sad peace of which i found it yet capable the dear unconscious partaker of my wayward fate with many an innocent smile revived my spirits and devoted to this only object of my pleasures i sought in her to lose the sense of every other care  the curiosity i had at first excited among the whole party extended not beyond common enquiries and as i spoke no spanish and french was but indifferently understood by either them or myself i could hardly hope greatly to interest them in my favor i had made them comprehend i was a near relation of the murdered mortimer but that circumstance far from interesting seemed rather to alienate and disgust them  it was night ere we reached st jago de la vega where we found the inhabitants universally under arms and eagerly expecting the return of those sent after the rebellious fugitives confounded with those persecuted wretches  unsheltered from the taunts insults and execrations of an incensed populace i found myself yet the victim of angry fortune and overworn with suffering dropped senseless at the door of a prison where i understood my journey was to end i revived on a miserable bed in a dark room without any companions but conscious of safety as well as free from guilt i recommended myself to god and sunk into the happiest repose i had known since i passed the fatal gates of rouen  a black slave brought me some coarse provisions in the morning nor did i know till the evening that it was meant to sustain myself and child for the day it proved however more than sufficient for my constitution which had hitherto resisted every danger had now received a shock of the most desperate kind racked with intolerable pains through all my limbs i was sensible too late that my own imprudence had added a malady of body to all my mental sufferings during the last awful conflict when the offending rebels expiated with life the ravages they had committed i in common with the females they had left behind had thrown myself on the damp ground alike through weariness and terror the unwholesome chills from a spot which yet the sun never penetrated stiffened every joint a rheumatic fever was the cruel consequence alone uncomforted unassisted consumed by an internal raging fire i groaned i shrieked with intense torture the starts and cries of my little one alone informed me i had done so i hushed her on a bosom i feared would scorch her and eagerly swallowing whatever liquid was brought me had hardly intervals of sense enough to share it with my babe or sufficiently to provide for her nourishment the days of this excessive misery were unnumbered  insensibly the fever subsided but left a lameness happier hours and incessant care could never cure  when returning reason allowed me to extend my reflections beyond the present evil i recollected from the time elapsed that my imprisonment must be decided and perpetual emanuel had told me the governor was timid mean and avaricious forgetful of this i had informed my conductors of the family tie between myself and mortimer which rendering me his natural heir this unworthy governor had doubtless annihilated my claim to possessions he was resolved to appropriate by classing me with the murderers among whom i was found and by an arbitrary proceeding not uncommon there if emanuel might be relied on sentenced me at once not daring to venture a judicial enquiry the languor incident to such incessarit sufferings both of body and mind as i had for a course of time endured rendered me less shocked and grieved at this than many other contingencies it seemed in my power to die and disappoint the malice of my oppressors it was only to remit a little a very little care of myself and my constitution would finally give way perhaps i should have delivered myself wholly up to this idea but that the first great tie of nature still wound round my bleeding heart my fate said i to myself is fully is finally accomplished a sad inheritor of my mothers misfortunes methinks they are all only retraced in me  led like her a guiltless captive through a vindictive mob the object of vulgar insult and opprobrium  like her enclosed unjustly in a prison even in the bloom of life a broken constitution is anticipating the infirmities of age and shall the similitude end here no let me like her extract fortitude from each accumulating injury and if the will of my maker shortens the common term of life alloted to mortality oh let me come into his presence a spotless martyr and thou sweet babe permitted like the palm tree to flourish under oppression surely for some great end have thou survived the succession of calamities which foreran thy existence nor dare thy mother once wish to desert thee  the days madam thus strangely past on the female slave i have mentioned appeared every morning and performing the common offices of life in silence placed near me the food allotted and vanished till the next imagine not i went on thus without attempting at least to ascertain my imputed crime but i found the poor wretch was so totally deaf that not one word reached her nor did she speak any other language than her own and very imperfect spanish to which i was a stranger neither could i convey to her by signs ideas i could find no visible object to represent the tender graces of my daughter nevertheless operated gradually on the untaught soul of the negro and i had reason to think she would even have connived at my escape but that such a measure would only have increased my misfortunes while thus without a friend a home or a hope  one only circumstance embittered my mind with distant remembrances the tower in which i was confined adjoined to the fort and had one window commanding the sea the other looked toward the inland country the cannon constantly proclaimed the arrival or departure of every vessel and my eager heart irresistibly impelled me toward the window but it was not for me they came  no hope of a release  no well known face to greet me  those ships that departed impressed me with ideas yet more painful and gloomy the arms of england distant england often enriched every streamer and my sick soul groaned under the conviction that i must never hope to view the port which would restore those mariners comparatively careless of the advantage to the local ties of country kindred and friendship to all that gives charms to existence  haunted by a pleasure which was always in my view without being ever in my reach i could not subdue the killing emotions thus raised in my soul  the growth of my child alone marked to me the progress of time ah moment how sweet art thou yet to my memory when first her little voice strove at articulation the blessed name of mother at length broke the drear silence of my prison and hardly the celestial sounds of hovering angels had i been launching into eternity could give me a sublimer pleasure i saw her walk with a transport scarce inferior engrossed by and devoted to this sole object of my eyes and heart which the gracious author of universal being permitted her to fill i no longer repined at my unmerited captivity only anxious lest any one should suspect my possession of this invaluable gem i felt ready to hide her even when the old slave made her daily appearance the common raiment with which we were periodically supplied i became ingenious in fitting to her little form and by that insensible contraction of our faculties which extends through nature although it is only observed in the organs of sight i drew into this narrow bound those fears hopes wishes and employments which in rapid succession fill up our lives and leave behind a remembrance we always revert to with satisfaction and often conceive to have been happiness  fearful at some intervals left the want of air or exercise should nip my beauteous blossom i devised a thousand little plans to make her run within her narrow bounds and strengthen a constitution born perhaps to trials not inferior to those which had blighted her mothers youth i held her to the window morning and evening and found the winds of heaven blew not less pure through iron bars than gilded lattices ah surely my memory does not err when i say with the poet that from the children of the firstborn cain to him who did but yesterday suspire there was not such a gracious creature born for natures gifts she might with lilies vie and with the halfblown rose i was one day holding the dear child to the evening air her little hands now grasped the rough bars and now were extended through them while her innocent tongue beguiled her fond mothers attention when i suddenly perceived a black woman apparently of distinction leaning under an awning raised at no great distance and while she talked busily to the slaves who were fanning her the eyes of all were turned intently on my infant i snatched her away with an apprehension the most lively i had for years felt i even absented myself from the window for a long time then venturing a glance without approaching near enough to be seen i perceived her eyes were still fixed upon my prison and the repose of that night was wholly destroyed by a vague fear the next day confirmed at the same hour she returned again to the same pavillion and after watching the window in vain as i no longer dared approach it she showed manifest tokens of chagrin and disappointment alas this was not all my old negro appeared soon after and delivering me an unintelligible message demanded my daughter i prayed wept entreated groaned to the poor wretch whose eyes alone of all her senses seemed affected by my agonies after a thousand incomprehensible signs on her part and resolute refusals on my own she snatched the child from those weak arms which wanted an equal power of resistance and left me stretched on the floor from the lameness i have mentioned  it was long ere i had courage to approach the window but collecting every power of mind and body i at length ventured thither i saw the darling child seated on cushions at the feet of the woman whose power tore her from me laden with toys and overwhelmed with caresses this however was but a small relief to my maternal anguish while uncertain whether i had not lost her for ever nor did my apprehensions diminish when i saw the attendant slaves bear their mistress away on a covered couch with my child in her arms ah then my prison became a dungeon indeed i smote my head against the enclosing bars and the air echoed to my groans they were only relieved by the return of my old slave who leading in my lamented cherub once more blessed my arms with the burden my heart rushed so impetuously toward her that it seemed to extend through my whole throbbing frame as i surveyed the recovered blessing with added fondness i perceived the gentle black i had so injuriously distrusted had lavishly adorned the tender object of a surprising attachment imagine a girl between three and four years old flight graceful fair and blooming whose amber locks the hand of nature had twined into a thousand spiral rings which fell over a loose vest of silver muslin girt with roses her little arms and ancles encircled with fanciful bracelets of different colored beads while her hand bore a gilt basket filled with fruits of the country she seemed a being of another world descending to bless this  while yet in the arms of her fable conductor she appeared to me like newborn light reposing on the bosom of chaos i took the little luxuries she offered and while indulging a sense time and abstinence had almost annihilated i worshipped the hand which thus at length relented  ah madam it is only in the early seasons of heavy visitation we dare to repine when misery once reaches the extreme it has always salutary effects purified entirely from the vain wants and wishes our pride and our passions for a long time represent as the very essentials of our being we then set a due value on the commonest blessings and soon find in every thing an enjoyment  when i pondered over the infinite and various advantages my daughter might derive from the partiality of a woman whose authority was great enough to open the doors of our prison my heart became sensible of hopes in her favor i had long ceased to indulge in my own and resigning myself to the prospect i sunk into a repose which might almost be called happy a short time habituated me to periodically parting with and receiving my daughter always laden with some little present conducive either to my health or comfort our benefactress too ever kindly retired to the spot i could command as if desirous to gratify me at the same moment with herself and greatly indeed did she fulfill her purpose i saw in spite of that fatality which had long hung over my unhappy family an exertion of heaven in favor of my child which encouraged me to hope a favorable revolution at some perhaps not distant period while in the tedious interval the means of health and comfort were amply bestowed on her and the latter through her means on her exhausted mother  at some intervals weeks nay a month would elapse without my daughters being sent for by which i concluded some one in still higher authority controled the actions of her negro friend though the benefits in a great degree remained to us wholesome fruits better provisions more agreeable clothing and a more watchful attendance i sometimes wondered the woman who thus generously alleviated our sufferings never once enquired into their origin but having learnt by painful experience the impropriety of judging without information i still flattered myself with the prospect of a release which at the worst i considered as only delayed till i could perfect my daughter in the woeful tale of those later events which thus unjustly confined us  in process of time i understood from my sweet marys improved accents that our benefactress was named anana and never from that moment did my soul offer up a prayer in which that name however unhallowed was not included  the total ignorance in which my daughters mind yet remained shocked and grieved me being wholly without books i knew not any manner of supplying their place and could only substitute principles for modes and instill into her tender mind the religious and moral documents which yet existed in mine i endeavored to give her an idea of the nature and appearance of books i every day made her repeat that word a hundred times i charged her to do so immediately whenever she visited anana but whatever the reason i saw her near eight years old apparently without having been able to procure her the advantage or myself the relief of reading  thus innocently and happily employed i one day saw my prison door thrown open and the interview so long desired unexpectedly granted me anana entered in mourning i incoherently blended the dictates of gratitude and sorrow the amiable anana told me in broken french she came to comfort me charmed to find it in my power to render myself intelligible to her i related briefly my story which her complacency assured me she did not half understand it was with the utmost difficulty i comprehended from her that don pedro de sylva the unjust governor who had condemned me without examination was at length dead that she had for some time past been his favorite and used the influence that title gave her to indulge her fondness for my child and lighten my captivity that it had always been as much in her power to visit my prison as now but not finding any certain crime imputed to me and sure if i could acquit myself of the suspicion she should become warmly interested in my favor perhaps to the degree of exasperating the benefactor she might then be obliged to despise she wisely forbore gratifying her generous curiosity and contented herself with bestowing such marks of her attachment as would not interfere with the rights of the governor or diminish her own finally that death had snatched away the only man who could restrain her inclinations and as he had bequeathed her a considerable portion of his wealth she had bestowed a part of it to obtain from the new governor a remission of my sentence and having succeeded now came to assure me i should be at liberty to return to europe for which voyage her friendship would amply supply me with means company and attendance as it was her purpose to quit for ever a country where she had lost her only connection and seek in another protection religion and peace  during this discourse i thought my senses almost failed me i made her a thousand times repeat the welcome the surprising intelligence that i was free and the arrival of her slaves to convey me from the melancholy dungeon i believed the day before would at some future one become my grave alone gave confirmation to so incredible an event but when i really saw myself at liberty when i saw the varied heavens above my head and the green earth under my feet when the soft fragrance of the almostforgotten blossoms indulged one sense and the sweet founds of congratulating voices blessed another i wonder i did not expire with the tumult of mingled emotions this happy moment revived in my heart i raised my soul to him who gave those senses and breathed life into the elements which sustain them and besought him to moderate my feelings or condense them all in gratitude  blended once more almost miraculously in the concerns of this world i learnt with a thousand sensations no words can describe that elizabeth had a few months before paid the debt of nature and that my brother james as well by her nomination as the rights of his birth and the voice of the people had ascended the throne of england happily uniting under his sway two kingdoms so many ages hostile as hardly to leave a hope of the event which was now without bloodshed fully accomplished time grief and misfortune had so far allayed the irritation of my mind that i blessed the ordination of providence which thus left my resentment without an object higher happier and dearer prospects opened before me and i looked forward with impatience to the moment when i should present my smiling mary to my beloved sister and in the society of connections so precious lose the remainder of my days  alas madam i required sentiments like these to sustain me against the conviction that the intense heats of the climate had united with the want of air and exercise to fix the lameness the rheumatic fever had left and completely debilitate my constitution which has from that period been subject to a thousand little wearing nameless maladies that insensibly absorb the spirit of youth and bring on an early old age  anana actuated by a fondness for my daughter scarce inferior to my own shared with me in every maternal care and earnestly besought me to receive her under my protection on our arrival in england where i had made her sensible i held a distinguished rank solemnly assuring me it was her intention to bequeath to my sweet child the wealth she derived from the governor alike to prove her own attachment and as a compensation for our long and unjust imprisonment the state in which she had lived with don pedro supplied an objection at which my pride revolted but that almost instantaneously gave way to principle i resolved to be above sacrificing the duties of gratitude and benevolence to opinion and remembering her untaught mind knew no tie in wedlock but constancy and perhaps in that instance might vie with myself i sought by cultivating the wild but solid virtues of her soul to bury the remembrance of her former error and fortify her against any future one open to the pure impressions of religion and morality the amiable anana promised to become an ornament to human nature but alas a greater power than i could overruled shortened her span and at once determined for us all the small pox always so dangerous in the islands broke out suddenly and swept off hundreds the apprehensions people of ananas nation ever entertain of it contribute most probably to reader it so fatal she threw herself into such agonies that the eruption soon appeared with the most mortal symptoms delirious alike with the dreadful malady and her extreme fondness for my daughter she called for her incessantly she strove to break from her attendants and get out of bed in search of her she entreated me in the most moving broken accents once more to let her hear the little angel she could no longer see to suffer her to give into her little hand the casket she was so soon going to bequeath her the terrified mother shrunk in silence from such a conflict ah what are all the gems she will bequeath her cried i to that breathing one herself  all now left of my promised fortunes the dictates of gratitude t hen prevailing i would cry but can i refuse the last request however wild and erroneous of her who preserved the being she now would involuntarily endanger finding reason ineffectual toward conquering the dying wish of anana i acquitted myself to her by leading to the bed of infection and death my little treasure with a resignation i could only compare to that of abraham and like the innocent he would have devoted my child was returned to me the exhausted anana considering this with justice as the highest effort of gratitude and esteem yielded herself patiently to the will of heaven which soon called her hence  the sincere concern this loss occasioned gave way to one still nearer my child sickened with the same horrible distemper and centered in anxiety every faculty of my soul it soon however took the most favorable turn and left me at leisure to endeavor to secure the legacy our lost friend had put into my hands the deceased governor had converted the principal part of the property he realized into diamonds a common practice in countries where justice is partially administered nor did the new governor know either their number or value anana having followed the directions of her benefactor in hiding a part and bribing his successor to acquiescence by sharing the remainder i had now gained worldly wisdom enough to adopt the same plan and having fulfilled every duty i joyfully embarked for england accompanied by several slaves who preferred attending on me to the precarious blessing of liberty under arbitrary power  ah madam how different was this voyage from that already commemorated  from the fallen tree i then continually watered with my tears a tender a lovely scion had sprung up it flourished in the shade it blossomed in sunshine with sweet with gentle hopes i bore it to its native soil no barbarous hand was now lying in wait to destroy it no pestilential wind blew from those cliffs which shot their white arms into the ocean and hospitably invited us to the bosom of peace ah no a dear though small circle of sympathizing friends would receive the forlorn the widowed wanderer as one arisen from the dead would grace my woeful tale with many a lamenting tear  my sister too my darling ellinor  how perfect how pure cried my swelling heart will be our reunion how will she fondly fold to her generous bosom this dear child of the ocean  this soothing unconscious fellowsufferer  this early partner in her matildas wayward fortune  pause madam over this fair prospect and let me rest a while my weary fingers and spirits  the recess etc part iv i struggled with the sad remembrances indelibly impressed on my heart when my eyes again beheld the shore of england and folding to my bosom the dear offspring of love and misfortune i shut up every sense in her already alive to the anxious hopes and wishes that so early tincture a being with which alone they expire she fondly flattered herself with the expectation of an unknown good and impatiently wished for the termination of our voyage i landed at greenwich because the spot where i could soonest learn intelligence of the sydney family as the people who kept the chief inn i remembered had been servants to lord leicester alas i had overlooked the long term of my absence and the probability that they might either be dead or removed greenwich which i had seen the seat of gaiety empire and magnificence now appeared a dreary solitude the tide in silence laved the walls of a deserted palace which verging to decay like its past possessors seemed but a gaudy mausoleum i paused over these fragile memorials of human grandeur as the boat bore me toward the shore and half surmised the strangeness that might await me there i was presently surrounded by a set of unknown faces and after much tedious enquiry learnt that my tender friend lady arundell still inhabited her house near chelsea whither i dispatched a messenger with a billet it demanded a welcome for a poor widowed wanderer and a babe for whose existence that dear woman was perhaps responsible as it was wholly owing to her indulgence i added i would not venture one enquiry till i gained fortitude from her presence but doubted not i should have as much to learn as to unfold if as my flattering forebodings informed me my darling sister yet survived i was persuaded by whatever name she was now distinguished she would once more answer to that with transport and fold to her glowing bosom a weary heart which had long fought in vain a resting place but i submitted the discovery and meeting solely to the care and prudence of our mutual friend  i waited not long in suspense for my messenger hastened back with a billet incoherent as surprise and joy could make it fly said the generous lady arundell to my arms to my heart to my home  they will ever be open to you and yours  i suspend all explanations till i see you  ah matilda dear to my eyes will be that lovely face however changed by misfortune  grateful as this invitation proved my soul was sensible of a damp and disappointment from the obscurity cast over the interval of my absence and her leaving unanswered my enquiry for my sister i hastened nevertheless to obey the request the sad meditations which would have engrossed my faculties in passing through london were continually interrupted by the transports of my little mary the varying streets filled with gay shops and thronged with finedressed people were a novelty to her of the most charming and interesting nature ere i could half answer her enquiry into each new wonder it was lost in the next and that chastened pleasure a mother extracts from blending the sigh of knowledge with the smile of innocence claimed its turn in my agitated bosom suspending more powerful emotions but when my eyes rested on the gates of lady arundells house those gates from whence i last took my flight so dearly accompanied a pang so pungent wrung my heart that my feeble sense sunk under it and i swooned away i revived and it seemed rather by the cries and tears of my little one than the remedies of the servants who surrounded me my sweet mary had climbed up the couch on which they laid me and clasping her arms round my neck laid her mantling cheek to my pale one and shed deluges of tears i comforted her and feeling my hand pressed by some body who sat almost behind me turned and fixing my eyes on the streaming ones of lady arundull i threw myself silently into her arms and felt my very soul dissolve upon her bosom both were half suffocated with feelings too high wrought and the presence of my daughter proved a fortunate relief for drawing me fondly down to her why do you cry mama said the dear one and why does this lady cry i thought we came home to be happy and happy we will be my darling cried lady arundell pressing her to a bosom melting in her favor who can be otherwise blessed with such a cherub can you complain matilda when heaven has left you her  no my admirable friend sighed i i do not complain  my reason reproves those tears my wounded heart will not cease periodically to pour forth this house this room even your tenderness awakens a train of killing remembrances i have in vain endeavored to arm myself against here here even here has my soul expanded toward her father with a pleasure of which herself and this weed are the only memorials  the entrance of servants with refreshments suspended a little the agitation of both and lady arundell obstinately refused every kind of information concerning my sister or friends till the next day insisting i should devote the remainder of the evening to a minute recital of my own story the astonishment its incidents every moment excited in lady arundell seemed to make it more wonderful even to myself having the happy assurance from her that my sister still lived i gave way to the sweet hope of seeing her and filled up with her idea a chamber which now appeared more solitary than ever  my impatience concerning my ellinor could no longer be restrained and when we met in the morning i importunately demanded her story the visible reluctance with which lady arundell granted my request confirmed my fears of some dreadful catastrophe and had i not been assured my sister yet lived i should have concluded her loss the fatal event our friend feared to acknowledge but satisfied in this instance and having no tie which could comparatively interest me i fortified my mind against the impression of inferior sorrows by the deep sense of those i had already survived  whatever courage i had collected i needed it all when with that fearful pomp of preparation with which friendship ever binds up the wounds of fate lady arundell produced a number of papers most of which appeared to be written by my sister i kissed the dear traces of a hand so beloved alas those sheets are yet by me and i need only copy them  the life of ellinor addressed to matilda  oh you much loved but little trusted dear sister of my heart whom it fondly pursues through unknown climes where yet perhaps you wander the victim of a fatal attachment receive in these papers if they ever meet your eyes the last testimony of an affection which as it was the first my soul became sensible to so surely will it be the last oh thou allied to me in destiny no less than blood for we were born alike to be unknown except to each other lo i lay my heart unveiled before you its passions its pride its prejudices condemn them not my sister however they may contradict your own  estimate duly the silence i have so long preserved the sacrifices i have made sacrifices so much the more meritorious as my soul ever revolted against the mean imposer and submitted but to you i knew the delicacy of your mind and would not add to the weight which hung upon its nobler faculties by a confidence that might wrong at the same moment your duty ah no i remembered williams and was from that moment prudent if not happy  yet as i know too well the horrors of mystery incertitude and silence for have i not spent ages in vainly guessing at your fate let me rescue you from a life of surmise by perusing this sad memorial perhaps this astonishing separation will prove eternal  if then my heart no more shall feel the throb of affection it has always given when yours pressed against it and something seems to tell me that pleasure shall never more be mine receive in this recital a last proof of my tenderness and oh my dear illfated sister may it mitigate the keenness of your affliction to learn you have not been the greatest sufferer  in one part of this story i must ever have been obscure and insincere but that heaven has snatched away the worshipped object of whose character we judged in so different a manner oh pardon me allgracious heaven if my opinion has been erroneous  pause here matilda if your rising soul has taken the alarm and weigh well the love you bear me for i shall need it all unless i falsify the fact  on the memorable day when heaven decided the destiny of the one sister and perplexed that of the other by presenting to the eyes of both the favorite of elizabeth how diametrically opposite were the impressions each took of his character astonishing that two agreeing in every instance till that moment should for the first time differ in so decided a manner more astonishing that every following day only confirmed the separate judgments the darling alike of art and of nature the eye or mind could demand no more than was comprised in the person of lord leicester  but here in my opinion the charm ended his heart not warm by nature had been rendered in a great degree callous from having always passed his life in the chilling atmosphere of a court unbounded in his projects timid and subtle in his actions tyrannick in his pursuits the object he could not govern could never long attach him ambition pride and vanity those leading traits in almost every character were in his so exquisitely blended and corrected by the frost of his nature that they might often be mistaken for nobler passions you were presented to his eyes in early youth a finished pattern of beauty endued with royalty in the first tender bloom of a newly awakened love uniting thus in your own person the strongest powers of charming with such as were peculiarly congenial to the heart you wished to win it laid itself at your feet oh woeful moment when it did so as it entailed upon you all the miseries of a mutual passion without half its enjoyments alas matilda had you really been adored  yet what could that have done more than to severely aggravate all you was born to suffer and as the apparent passion of lord leicester had to you the charms of reality i am to blame perhaps thus to represent it but the season of dissimulation is past and my tortured heart will utter nothing but truth so fixed was my opinion of his character that though there was a moment of my life when my fate seemed wholly in lord leicesters hands i could not then enough esteem him to venture his decision yet still a tender pity for your unmerited and everlasting passion should have suppressed this in your mind harsh judgment but that i once more repeat my own actions must ever then have appeared eccentric and enigmatical  how deeply both father anthony and i regretted the imprudence which introduced into our solitary asylum so dangerous a visitor it were needless now to repeat prudence was for once on the side of passion and your fate was by the will of your only remaining guardian for ever united with that of your lover i soon found it vain to oppose the ascendency he had gained in your affections and as my own were yet unoccupied i looked no farther than the present moment and followed you to kenilworth castle without repining nevertheless i admired the delusions of love which in a moment reconciled you to a situation apparently so obscure and abject and still more that total blindness to your own exquisite perfection which could make you fancy that low state would ever appear to observing spectators your natural one what then must be my astonishment to see lord leicesters love impose such humiliations on an object nature and fortune had placed so far above him and meanly content himself with monopolized indulgences  scarce were we alone when the presumption of that wretch williams filled both of us with a terror which required an immediate remedy every faculty of my soul revolted against the abject compliances your entreaties exacted from me but even those only served to strengthen the contempt which began to predominate in it lord leicesters return gave us a temporary relief but his method of getting rid of the villain appeared to me alike unsafe and mean and the only proper mode of ending our fears never once seemed to occur to him i mean acknowledging his marriage which perhaps might at that period have been done without any great danger of offending elizabeth whose withering heart was becoming every day less sensible of affection and whose vanity was so highly gratified and possessed by the visit of the duke of anjou but it was the interest of my lord to break the match with the french prince and to that golden idol his every passion bowed we were again left to work tapestry and when he had succeeded in his favorite project he left the queen in turn to bewail alone the loss of her last lover and came once more to amuse himself at kenilworth  but he was not always to succeed the jealousy of elizabeth had now just provocation and in her sudden arrival at kenilworth castle she at last overreached her politic favorite in vain he would have concealed us  in vain he would have represented us as the vassals of his amusement the scrutinizing eye of the queen the universal voice of her more impartial train pronounced this impossible reduced to frame a new story tortured with the conviction that it had not gained credit he was obliged to aggravate every disagreeable circumstance of our present situation by delivering us unwillingly into the hands of elizabeth alas my sister i saw i understood all this cost you on my account while not one sigh on your own escaped you i stifled the painful and proud sensations that swelled at my heart and ventured into the world under the doubtful and mysterious patronage of the queen who better acquainted with the finesses of her favorite than those now nearly allied to him never for one moment was the dupe of his fiction though unable to disprove it  ah how visionary seems on recollection our new situation seen without being known adored without being esteemed punished without being guilty applauded without being meritorious we were all an illusion yet surrounded with spies and acting for ever under an eye disposed to condemn ere it could half discover how difficult was it for us to avoid suspicion and censure one sole advantage had either gained by converging into the sphere of a court a faithful friend though even that blessing was curtailed by the eternal policy of my lord who would not permit us to confide even to his own amiable nieces the ladies arundell and pembroke any part of a secret which might affect however remotely his own safety bounded as our conversations must of consequence be the charm of attachment nevertheless seized upon our souls mine allied itself to lady pembroke while yours equally inclined to her no less amiable sister and each took pleasure in passing that portion of her time with the distinct favorite we did not spend together ah here matilda i approach the appointed moment when the paths of life in which we have hitherto trod hand in hand begin to separate and every succeeding step bears us farther from each other till darkness and distance rob the straining eye of its first dear object  in vain each now turns back and seeks the accustomed path a thousand various ones perplex the wearied mind and while the impetuous passions drag us irresistibly onward we give to the sweet memory of early youth a thousand fond and hopeless sighs then follow with trembling feet those ungovernable leaders  lord pembrokes partiality had long distinguished a noble youth the policy of lord leicester still kept abroad i had seen many of his letters through the medium of lady pembroke and my heart had learnt to flutter at the name of essex ere yet i beheld him alas even while i repeat it i own the same sensation  oh love exquisite delusion captivating error from the moment the lips find pleasure in that word till they lose the power of pronouncing it the charm the inconceivable charm remains  whether cherished by the sunbeams of hope or chilled by the dews of disappointment  whether the chosen object is faithful or unfaithful  glowing with animation before our eyes or seared up in the dark and silent grave the passion the powerful passion asserts its eternal influence and decides the character where it once has reigned while i dwell on the moment which called to being this finer and more poignant sense sensibility memory retraces its dear emotions with a softness time itself can never extinguish  tinctured with the partiality of lord essexs friends already acquainted with his sentiments on heroism glory and every attachment except that of the heart i fondly flattered myself the day would come when he would receive from me that last and liveliest passion which forms and finishes the human soul i interwove myself insensibly in all his concerns i deeply lamented the tie of relationship which subjected his actions to the will of lord leicester and employed some of the little time i spent with my lord in endeavoring to bias his mind in favor of the absent hero cold and silent on the subject of essexs merits lord leicester often bantered me on being so sensible of them and seldom failed to remind me of the family compact which had bound lord essex to wed sir francis walsinghams only daughter to fulfill which he purposed soon to recall him and advised me rather to turn my eyes on sir walter raleigh whose talents he pronounced infinitely superior and whose homage was wholly paid to me as this was a lover he knew i detested the conversation generally ended when he was named but a succession of such discourses confirmed me in the opinion of lord leicesters selfishness and prepared me perhaps to decide in opposition to it  essex was at length summoned to england he arrived an idle unaccountable apprehension at once overcame my reason i was persuaded i could not see him with indifference i feared the keen eye of elizabeth and the colder and more watchful one of lord leicester i quitted the court the day he was to be presented and past it with lady pembroke by a singular chance miss walsingham had chosen to do the same the party enlarged insensibly as the circle decreased essex was the theme of every tongue and while miss walsinghams triumphant eyes acknowledged the implied compliments my yielding heart received them he is here cried lady pembroke in the afternoon looking out of the window and kissing her hand i felt ready once more to run away but that decorum restrained me lady pembroke indulged one of the gay whims which so often were a source of pleasure at once to herself and her friends and insisted he should only be told his bride was among the unmarried ladies from whom his heart must select her it was an illjudged project miss walsingham had been contracted to lord essex in childhood rather to ratify a reconciliation between the families than with any idea of a future affection the rigid principles of lady walsingham had hitherto kept her daughter in total seclusion and the death of her mother had now given the young lady unbounded liberty her passions naturally violent had always spurned restraint but compelled for a time to submit to it they marked her character even in early youth with haughtiness the beauty she eminently possessed soon drew around her a crowd of lovers which elevating her vanity added coquetry to pride and united in her person the strange extremes of sour reserve and unbounded levity sir philip sydney was the only man supposed to have any interest in her heart but as he had from the first devoted himself to another she affected to despise him and wait the return of her allotted husband with a resolution to accept of him  miss walsingham seconded the proposal of lady pembroke which rather perplexed the rest of the company and after much pleasantry on the subject of sympathy lady pembroke sent for her lord and the stranger  ah heavens that invincible stranger  born to decide my destiny  his youth had accustomed me to expect to find something unformed and unfinished in his person and manners  how then was i surprised to see the height and majesty of lord leicester united with features no less perfect while every grace of figure feature and complexion were lighted up by brilliant youth an air at once elegant and ingenuous and an expression of sensibility like that he could not fail to awaken no i have not half described the dear the deep impression  i would in vain describe it  he looked and i then first seemed to see  he spoke and i then first seemed to hear  fearful lest any marked disorder should betray me i fixed my eyes upon the ground but they had already borne the image into my heart i still saw it within and my charmed sense retained the sound of that voice regardless of all others  smiling expressively at lady pembrokes authoritative order he kissed the hand she had given him and dropping it knelt gracefully to me  gracious heaven how excessive was my confusion at this unlucky mistake yet how exquisite my silent pleasure the overpowering mirth of the whole party displeased him  kindly deigning to impute my distress solely to that cause he solicited my pardon for having united me in the very excellent jest the ladies were obliging enough to make at his expense adding in a lower voice that wherever parental authority had destined him to bow he should always remember with pride and pleasure the distinguished choice his heart had ventured to make then advancing to miss walsingham whose readiness saved him a second mistake he made her some cold compliment which awakened every fiery particle of her nature and passed on to pay the same respect to the rest of the ladies while his eyes ever and anon rested on me with that passionate ingenuousness which through life has been his characteristic  i left him behind and returned to court glowing with the same ardent passion i had once dared to condemn in you and flattering myself he was already studying how to break an engagement not ratified by his heart how sweet were the hours rich with that hope ready every moment to acknowledge the truth and to indulge my passion by reposing it in your faithful bosom i found you overwhelmed with tears apprehension and anguish for it was at this very period the cruel and extravagant jealousy of lord leicester became apparent wanting courage to mention an incident remote from the cause of your sorrow i buried the dear impression in my heart and devoted myself to soothing a mind so deeply wounded by a strange transition in my own sentiments i had learnt fairly to judge of yours and the increasing similarity interwove our souls every day more and more strongly though not one word escaped me dreams of pride and grandeur which had sometimes embittered a spirit i will venture to call noble vanished at once before a stronger passion which strangely filled up that void in my mind nothing yet had ever been able to fill i no longer complained of the queen  i no longer thought the court a prison  conforming from that moment quietly to my fate i centered every wish in one sole object  i even employed myself diligently in developing lord leicesters sentiments and conciliating a difference both of you suffered alike by though neither would allow it lord essex during these conversations was ever near us  with watchful eye endeavoring to dive into the nature of our connection and the mystery of our birth so industriously buried by leicester and elizabeth the disgust your lord already showed toward essex became on these occasions more marked and as its cause i sought by every little distinction to reward that dear lovers patience a dislike so unjust heightened however that i already felt toward lord leicester though at the same moment it supplied a still more urgent reason for concealing it than those which had hitherto influenced me  the sufferings of your mind sunk into mine and profiting by the sad example of a passion imprudently indulged i called myself to account for cherishing so dangerous a weakness and resolved by a courageous effort to govern if i could not extinguish it but ah how vain is that attempt when once we are truly touched love my sister like the enwrithed serpent only compresses the heart more closely for every effort we make to shake it off in vain i turned my contemplations toward the obscurity which had hitherto attended our lives the dark and mysterious cloud which yet hung over them love drew a vivid rainbow across it and every tear due to misfortune fell tinctured with essex ah wherefore should calamity heighten that passion without being able to define the cause i acknowledge the effect the heart forever active perhaps then ferments most powerfully and where love has once found room every agitation cooperates to its increase however distinct its origin  yet if the weakness of woman could be justified by the merit of the object the more i examined essex the more reason i had to be satisfied that noble candor which resisted through life the courtly artifice he neither knew to profit by or adopt was at this period eminently conspicuous while his warm heart and polished understanding made him no less the friend than the patron of genius every indifferent spectator admired to see even his youth rich with every promise fulfilled in the riper years of sydney and thought sir francis walsingham the happiest of men in being able to match his daughter with either of these distinguished minds the generous essex scorned to deceive her he did not refuse to marry and paying his deceased fathers will the deep respect of appearing ready to comply with it waited the operations of fortune in his favor and adored me in silence  at this juncture the camp claimed lord leicester and the nobility accompanied him i shared the mortal chagrin with which you saw him depart in silence and followed you so truly through all your feelings that i sought to persuade myself essex might only want the power to treat me in the same manner this painful idea operated so strongly as to make me assume a coldness at parting to which essex was wholly unaccustomed and which to own the truth i did not cease regretting the whole time of his absence  the dispersion and defeat of the armada restored gaiety and eclat to the court the fullest reconciliation took place between you and lord leicester my heart opened once more to hope to happiness to essex who now took courage to unfold his sentiments to lady pembroke she instantly adopted his cause and promised to find him an opportunity to plead it nor was it long ere she drew me to her house and telling me with one of those happy smiles which disposed us to grant whatever she wished that from the first moment she saw me it had been one of the darling objects of her life to unite me with lord essex who alone appeared to her likely to deserve the heart she had so thoroughly studied she had engaged her lord to join with her in concerting that mode of introduction which appeared to me so wild a whim it had fully answered her hopes in fascinating one of the parties and she added she half believed it was not lost upon the other fixing her eyes for a moment on my glowing cheeks she gaily started up to throw open her closet door in short my dear cried she here is my lord himself allow him to plead his own cause and when i think i can speak more to the purpose depend on my interrupting him plucking her robe from my trembling fingers she ran out of the room distressed irresolute and overcome with the arrival of a moment so long wished for i made an effort to follow her but using the same means to detain me i had unsuccessfully tried with my friend lord essex grasped my robe more firmly i turned and not daring to fix my eyes on the graceful form the fine face on which they fell i dropped them and yielded in silence to hear him how deep ah heaven how exquisite is the remembrance of that moment when the name of love first reached my ear from the only voice which could render it agreeable  i will not imagine most worshipped of women said the earl i offer you any new homage in thus bending before you the moment my eyes first beheld you my tooready knees offered up to you a heart new to the passion that moment made eternal the highest sense of duty to a father whose will in all other instances was governed by reason hallowed even the generous error which induced him to contract me to miss walsingham destined to resign in the flower of his days every advantage which makes this world dear to man he studiously sought to secure them all for a son who watered his pale cheek with the tears of guileless childhood and to secure me friends at court who might supply in some degree his own place allied me nominally to the politic walsingham whose interest alone could counterbalance that of our inveterate enemies the cecil family the event justified his opinion a combination of circumstances would have buried me in obscurity had i not had the support and attachment of sir francis thus circumstanced it would ill become me to reject the daughter of the man to whom i owe my safety and distinction but early learning her character and fearing to trust my happiness in the hands of a girl whose violent temper destroyed her own i yielded to the pleasure of lord leicester in remaining abroad not without a hope which time confirmed that she would in the interim give her heart to some more assiduous lover i had reason to believe this wish was accomplished ere i ventured to return home her partiality for sir philip sydney is indeed too apparent for me to think of uniting with her were the friends of both willing to complete the match but as i cannot help flattering myself the determination of sir philip will regulate that of the walsingham family fain would i learn from your indulgence if indeed you deign to interest yourself in the fate of a man born but to adore you whether sydney has any thing to hope from your sister accept in this explanation my excuse for presuming to hover near your secret and do not imagine by uniting myself in it i seek to intrude on engagements i shall readily yield to whether i am permitted to understand them or not  charmed alike with the accents of that harmonious voice and the passion it generously avowed  prepared by the openness of his recital to indulge my natural candor i delivered myself wholly up to the impulse of my heart and the implied acknowledgment of my affection made when i condescended to explain your sentiments respecting sir philip lighted up his fine eyes with new softness and gratitude insensibly led on to speak of lord leicester i recollected at once the error i was committing and not daring to violate the silence i had promised i broke off abruptly covered with blushes and confusion  a long pause ensued  i raised my eyes anxious and irresolute to his  chagrin had dimmed all their luster  he saw the conflict in my mind and recollecting the superiority of his own character he conjured me to consider well all i would say and to believe that confidence would be only a weight upon his heart which mine should ever reproach me with bestowing his wounded feelings gave a persuasive tremulation to his voice that and the delicacy of mind which made him above profiting by the error of mine  the right a lover instantly acquires over the conduct of a woman who has once ventured to acknowledge her partiality  alas above all perhaps the exquisite fear such ever feel at appearing for one moment to distrust the object of their choice all united to authorize in my own judgment that full confession the occasion won from me the astonishing story of our birth the secret of the recess its discovery by lord leicester your subsequent marriage with him the feint by which the queen was influenced alike to remain silent on every point respecting us all was fully revealed  the veil of fiction fell at once and presented me to him the being i was born this interesting confidence cemented our mutual passion and gave such charms to the moment as memory ever returns to with pleasure i imposed on him a vow of silence and secresy till your decisive refusal of sir philip should fix his marriage with miss walsingham and more fortunate circumstances facilitate our own nor could the interval appear tedious to either while we were daily permitted to meet though in public and read in each others eyes a passion untinctured with doubt and which every following day promised to sanctify essex found too many sources of wonder and pleasure in the mutual confidence to oppose her he from that moment looked up to and we parted so satisfied with the interview that either would have bought it with life  nevertheless i was far from considering miss walsingham as the sole obstacle to our union the politic lord leicester strongly though silently opposed it nor indeed without reason conscious he had reigned so many years without a competitor in the heart of elizabeth he might justly dread the progress of a rival in whom all his advantages were united with many he never possessed not satisfied with the reputation of beauty and elegance leicester ever passionately desired that of conduct and valor and had given the kingdom but too convincing proofs how unequal he was to the military rank he held essex was born a soldier the rough and generous virtues of that character were joined in him with the polished graces of a courtier and the most refined taste for literature a man calculated to shine in whatever light you examined him could not fail to alarm all who valued and held the favor of elizabeth add to this that the earl was naturally bold and aspiring consequently would retain whatever he once possessed such were already the fears of all the favorites of the queen and who could bound mine when i recollected the dubious fate of his noble father and the last warning he had given to this darling son  the sudden and unexpected marriage of sir philip sydney and miss walsingham revived those hopes in the mind of essex i had so long strove to throw at a distance and with them too revived the vain project of confiding his views to lord leicester with whose approbation of them he still continued to flatter himself terrified lest such an unguarded measure should exasperate leicester to his utter ruin who would illbrook this embryo rival that should cross his fate in every instance and dare to contend with him for a share of those advantages he was determined to monopolize i exerted the utmost care to charm my lover to silence alas every day made that more difficult the queen and leicester fearful of my finding among the many who professed themselves my servants one whose views would interfere with theirs immediately allotted me that weak wretch lord arlington for a husband and in countenancing his addresses threw every other lover at a distance at the same time giving me but too much reason to apprehend if ever i was permitted to marry it must be as a sacrifice to both not daring to consult you on a subject i had so long concealed and on which we must ever think so differently and unwilling to blight the little gleam of sunshine love illumined your days with i resigned myself up to a gloom which hardly the presence of essex could dissipate  a very short time rendered the intentions of the queen and lord leicester obvious to essex his impassioned soul fired alike with love of me and disdain of him i was commanded to love treated lord arlington with so marked a contempt that nothing but the irresolution incident to weak minds could prevent arlington from making a mortal quarrel of it possessed in my confidence of the means to render lord leicester more tractable the earl of essex solicited my consent to insist on that of your lord as well as his interest with the queen if he valued the preservation of his own secret  the tender love which attached me to you alone could induce me to oppose a design of which my happiness was the ultimate object but convinced an eclaircissement of this kind would embroil me forever with lord leicester and fill your suffering mind with a trouble beyond all those you had already experienced i consented to see lord essex once more at lady pembrokes and exerting at that interview every power i possessed over his perturbed heart to moderate his rage and soothe his love till the ensuing campaign in the netherlands should be over i promised a steady resistance to every matrimonial proposal in the interval and to decide his fate on his return knowing it vain to hope to actuate him by any selfish consideration of his own welfare i buried in my own heart its deepest sources of apprehension and bound him to patience by a strong representation of the dangers to which any rashness on his part would infallibly expose me those inflamed passions no other being could ever control were regulated by my voice and when necessity compelled us to part i seemed to leave in his arms the dearer portion of my existence  occupied by feelings and views distinct from each other and agreeing only in watching the wind and sending every wish toward the camp you and i seldom entered into our accustomed confidence and friendship i had however sometimes the relief of a letter through the medium of lady pembroke by those i learnt your lord still maintained an outward show of civility toward essex while he secretly made him sensible of all his power yet with an art so profound as left him no apparent right to complain he often reminded me of my promise and vowed to preserve an undoubted claim to it by still enduring for my sake overwhelmed with anxiety and perplexities i hardly durst look toward the unravelling of events so complicated and waited in dreadful suspense the will of heaven it broke in thunder over me  the cruel situation in which you soon found yourself lord leicesters abrupt and imprudent return on the news of it  the politic construction he gave that return to the sick and doting queen  her sudden resolution to marry him and the immediate necessity for getting out of her power which rendered both him and you in one hour miserable fugitives were incidents so strange rapid and unsuspected that i became their victim ere i could any way account for it  the fatal morning of lord leicesters return you left him to attend the rising of the queen which was on that day your periodical duty i waited with impatience the event of my lords visit to elizabeth in which my own safety as well as yours was immediately concerned a servant of lady pembrokes in whom she reposed great trust suddenly brought me word that a fright had thrown her into premature labor and the danger was so imminent that even while we spoke she might breathe her last nevertheless the messenger in her name urged me to hasten to her if i valued the letters i had lodged in her hands i gave way to the alarm without reflection and accompanied the messenger instantly nor did i meet in passing through the palace any of our women or friends to whom i could mention the cause of my sudden absence happily the danger of my muchloved friend was over ere i arrived i pressed her hand in silence and took from it the packet relative to essex she had kept ready to give me which i put into my bosom and was hastening back when a stranger as i passed through the outer court presented me a note the hand my fluttered senses owned for that of essex but why should he return to england a confused fear arose in my mind which hardly left me power to read it it was anonymous but i learnt from it he had been at the house of lady pembroke where shocked at the distress into which her misfortune had just thrown her lord as well as the whole family he found it vain to hope their assistance toward obtaining an interview with me which nevertheless was highly essential to the peace and safety of both he ended with conjuring me to follow the bearer if i wished to save him from desperation  perhaps on the decision of this important moment depended the peace of my whole future life too surely my compliance infinitely lengthened the fatal absence from court which enthralled me for many painful years and dearly did i expiate that first deviation from propriety and prudence but are we always rulers over our feelings mine were agitated with almost every possible cause and coward reason too often retreats from the dangerous contest  i stepped into a hired boat the messenger showed me which was rowed down the river with the utmost rapidity during the little voyage i revolved in my mind every probable reason for this sudden and alarming return of the earl but i was at greenwich ere i yet had fixed on one i landed at a solitary garden belonging to lord southampton and was conducted to a pavillion which overhung the water where i found essex alone pale disordered and undrest with every symptom of anxiety and fatigue overwhelmed with i know not what agitation i sunk upon his shoulder as he knelt before me and gave way to an uncertain presentiment of sadness a few hours after so fully verified not even the charm of his voice could immediately soothe spirits so many alarming circumstances had deeply agitated nevertheless on comprehending surmise and not misfortune had brought him thus suddenly to england i felt my oppressed heart breathe a little more freely i byandby understood that the sole motive of this journey was the sudden one of lord leicester that by means of friends who surrounded your lord he had always endeavored to keep a watchful eye on his actions and found a packet of letters brought by a trusty hand from england had agitated him so strongly as to make him resolve on leaving his command and returning immediately the communication of this mysterious resolution determined him to follow the steps of his general which he was enabled to do as he fortunately acted only as a volunteer the impatience lord leicester discovered by his hasty journey authorized the fears of the rival who followed his steps and persuaded him either that the secret of my birth had transpired or that some maneuver was projected to dispose of me as policy dictated rendered desperate by these fears he had left every thing in train for an immediate return if fortunately i was still at liberty or if he could be the happy means of delivering me in case the whole truth had been discovered nor could he longer doubt but i would at last consent to follow the fortunes of a man who had never for a moment put all the hopes he might perhaps justly form in competition with the single one of possessing me the generous error of his conduct could not offend me but persuaded my own situation was not so desperate as he represented it i accounted to him for lord leicesters precipitate journey by acknowledging the truth and urged him to leave england directly that even his having visited it might never transpire but i talked to one who no longer attended to me his eyes wandered wildly over my features while his whole soul was engrossed by his favorite project possessed and distracted with the idea that lord leicester would infallibly ruin his hopes by disposing of me if ever i was again in his power not all my vows of everlasting love and fidelity to him nor promises of the most obstinate resistance to every other proposal could avail you are gone you are lost to me for ever if once these eyes lose sight of you was his impassioned reply a thousand times repeated to all my arguments and entreaties  it is the crisis of our fate my love would he cry  yield oh yield to it admitting you are proof against trials you cannot guess at till too late how know you but i may be sacrificed sir francis walsingham already repents consenting to annul the contract between me and his daughter she is already widowed a hint would engage lord leicester to favor its renewal for do not his views coincide with that project a word from him would determine the queen in its favor and a command from her disobeyed would exile me for life thus my sweet ellen continued this agitated lover you not only put your own fate in the hands of a man who will never consent to unite it with mine but even should you have resolution to resist his will you deliver up to it a wretch you say you dearly love and who certainly loves you to madness bathing the hands he grasped with precious drops of tenderness and anguish he held them alternately to his lips and heart  what was the distraction of my soul at that moment  inexorably to refuse was the hard duty imposed by my reason while my soul even melted with fondness but the fear that i should entail misfortune on the dear choice of my heart obscure at once the brilliant fortune which seemed to spread before his youthful steps and track them perhaps with blood a just remembrance of the severe censure i had passed on your conduct under circumstances not less trying and a conviction that such a compliance would infallibly endanger your safety made me resolve to act up to my sense of rectitude at whatever price i collected these reasons and many more which have now escaped my mind to prepare essex for a disappointment i was sure he would feel but too sensibly and strove to reconcile him to the refusal by convincing him his own welfare was the chief cause of it perhaps in truth it was for hardly can the sun tinge the dewdrops with more various hues than the soul will cast upon its feelings i a thousand times assured him that to be the sole object of his heart did not give me more pleasure than to see him the admiration of the kingdom the happy promise of his youth i added had centered every eye and every hope in him what then would be my grief and disappointment if the coming years which ought to crown him with glory were to bury him in obscurity or steep him in sorrow  that nature had formed me with a strength of mind to view every situation in its true light nor could i comprize all human passions in love though i thought it perhaps the leading one fill up the interval of our separation my lord cried i with a long succession of such heroic actions as may give to our union whenever heaven permits it the only happiness not comprised in itself  the sacred sense of having deserved it nor shall the gentler virtues of my sex be wanting time patience and fortitude often conquer fate herself nor will i ever yield to lord leicester an obedience i do not owe him though for my sisters sake i shall condescend to temporize in instances of less importance plighted to you by every tie the rites of the church could only ratify a claim which will from this moment make my acceptance of another an adultery of the worst kind hasten back then my dear essex conceal if possible that you have been absent and beware how you expose to the eyes of lord leicester a suspicion of his honor he would never perhaps pardon i broke from his arms strengthened surely by some supernatural aid  yet stay my beloved my worshipped ellinor  oh yet be persuaded  you leave me for ever  these aching eyes see you for the last time  never oh never shall i now call you mine  such were the passionate exclamations which vibrated on my quickened sense as i flew toward the boat and ordered the men to row to london my full eyes still sought that graceful form which with folded arms and a dejected air hung over the terrace and my heart dissolved at the accents which still lingered on my ear alas i knew not then how far they were prophetic  such was my conflict such my determination during the busy hours fraught with your fate and mine my sister the mind however soon recovers all its vigor when it has dared to act up to its duties and i had wept away my tender chagrin ere i reached the court ah let me shorten this part of my recital lest i rashly pause to question heaven why the most meritorious moment of my life became the cause of my ruin i reached london matilda two hours after you and lord leicester quitted it and fearful of the appearance my long absence might have even in your eyes did you know how the time had been spent i resolved to tell you i had passed the day at lady pembrokes bedside and to avoid the enquiry of indifferent persons stole at the close of the evening through the back courts thus fatally eluding every watchful care of lady arundell who had planted assiduous friends in every other avenue to the palace ready to intercept me when returning after she had caused london to be explored in vain to find me  ah gracious heaven what were my emotions when entering our apartment i saw the queens women and officers in possession of it the disorder of our cabinets and chests every thing indicated a dangerous discovery  a terror for which there is no name came over me a joyful exclamation on the part of those into whose hands i had fallen and a dispatch to the queen gave me reason to fear alike for my matilda to the enquiries i made no other answer was given than that they were employed to guard and not inform me and an officer of the queens immediately appeared to conduct me to her presence unable to command a single moment of solitude and silence to regulate my thoughts or actions the past the present and the future presented only one wild chaos to my mind which hardly the breath of heaven seemed able to bring into order pale horrorstruck and speechless i was dragged like a criminal into the closet of the queen whose burning cheeks and enraged eyes told me in one killing look all i had to dread my conductors were ordered to retire and lord burleigh with the old lady latimer were the only spectators of this dreadful interview scarce could my trembling limbs support me or my sunk soul utter a single word death  death in the most terrible form glared upon me  what do i say death oh that i had feared no other evil  grief insult obloquy all that can add horrors to the grave promised to forerun it the remembrance of the packet of letters the testimonials of my birth whatever was wanting to confirm the doubts of elizabeth or redouble her rage were all to be found about me matilda essex  those forms so dear glistered before my tearful eyes and i seemed in this perilous moment to drag down to the earth every human being i loved and valued  elizabeth gave way to that coarse violence which marks her manners is there a vindictive or opprobrious epithet she did not exhaust lord burleigh apprehending this ungoverned passion would rather give than gain information solicited her permission to examine me which she sullenly granted to all his artful and insidious enquiries i replied with truth veiling only such particulars of your life and my own as malice might construe into a crime always referring myself to lord leicester in whose bosom the secret of our fate was as the queen well knew deposited ah ha then traitress cried elizabeth no longer able to contain her rage her very eyes flashing fire so thou would artfully feign ignorance of thy detested sisters marriage with that villain thou glossest over so rarely that information i thank him he has thought proper to give me under his own hand pointing to a paper lying on the table near her take that truth from me and now unfold the rest or tortures shall wring it from thee  she continued to speak but i had ceased to hear  breathless mute astounded my feet seemed to take root on the spot where i stood and my tears alone proved i was not marble  lord leicesters marriage acknowledged  authenticated at such a juncture  and by himself too  heavens what a chaos did this news make in my mind  speak jezebel exclaimed the exasperated queen in a tone almost as inarticulate through passion as mine was through fear thou art still in my power  though the perfidious villain i had raised from the dust and loaded with benefits though he i say and his minion have escaped my vengeance thou art yet within my reach  tremble lest thou should answer should suffer for all  alas her utmost rage could hardly have added a pang to those which at that moment overwhelmed me another killing truth had unwarily escaped her  lord leicester himself then thought there was no safety but in flight  he was gone and my sister it was plain had accompanied him  both had surrendered me up a hopeless helpless victim however unoffending  even tears as well as language now failed me and my brain shot through with fire oh essex in this moment i yet remembered thee thy last words yet rung in my ears and my soul struggled with the deep regret i felt for having scorned thy project through a vain vain generosity elizabeth finding threats and interrogations alike lost on a girl whose absent senses seemed to have wholly retired into her heart now gave way to one of her violent transports she threw a large book of devotion which lay by her on the table with so good an aim that it struck me on the temple and i sunk senseless to the earth the attendants were all called in and my laces cut as having fainted the queen not choosing to avow a resentment so grossly expressed a ribbon from whence hung the dearer part of my existence those testimonials of my birth which were one day to fix my rank in life attracted the eye of elizabeth the ready attendants disengaged and presented them to her hand together with the packet containing my correspondence with essex i was insensibly reviving when she perused the first but surely that moment half avenged me  never did mind or body undergo a greater revolution  rage evaporated at once  surprise grief confusion silence succeeded with a face pale as my own trembling hands and failing eyes over and over again did she examine the incontestable proofs of so surprising an event then wildly glancing toward my features tore the papers into atoms she never thought small enough  during this interval i had so far recovered myself as to be capable of speaking but scarce had i uttered a sound ere she started in her turn afraid to hear take her away on your lives cried she in a broken and inward voice convey her into my little closet nor let one soul see or speak to her as you value my favor the servile slaves of her will executed this order with the tmost alacrity and the room was guarded by two officers who took from me every means of escape or death alas i thought not of either yielding to the desolating flood which had in one hour encompassed me i braved the future  betrayed delivered up by lord leicester  neglected forgotten by my sister  the pair for whom alone i seemed hitherto to have lived had fate another blow in store yet even if so it must sport with human misery to level it at me when those already given were mortal a stern and sullen despair succeeded the keen vicissitude of emotions which had marked the last hour of my life i considered myself as the devoted of heaven and man and resolved to oppose a heart rendered callous by injury to every future stroke of fortune  elizabeth forgot not her usual policy even while overwhelmed with surprise the room in which she had ordered me to be confined had another door which led to private passages through the palace and from this entrance a guard approached at midnight and informed me it was the pleasure of the queen that i should follow them i obeyed in silence and getting into a litter i found at the garden gate enquired not even my destination i traveled almost without resting for two days and a night care having been taken to provide relays which were every where ready during the first days journey a guard attended but all prospect of my being released by human assistance then ceasing i found myself delivered into the charge of lord burleigh and his servants my deep perturbations began now to subside and my soul inclined to its wonted habits though to have been betrayed by lord leicester and my sister was a recollection my wounded feelings had not yet courage enough to cope with alas how should they when the passions are permitted to decide our conduct however heroic it proves we claim not those returns reason tells us are due to every instance of virtue which had no other incentive than reason ah essex dear prophetic essex sighed my heart at some moments why why did i inexorably reject thy generous proposal that ungrateful sister to whose safety i sacrificed the sweetest hopes of my life manacles thy devoted love and flies far away to take shelter in that country i dared not seek even under thy protection  at the turn of the night a dreadful storm of thunder lightning wind and rain broke over us and the terrors natural to my sex on such occasions were doubled on finding the whole party were set on by a banditti a moment before and i should have affirmed i had nothing to dread yet so lively was my new fear that even the vengeance of elizabeth became nothing in the comparison the servants of lord burleigh made a desperate but vain resistance and the whole were at length led away by the ruffians into a wood adjoining where all no doubt like me expected to be murdered the storm now began to abate and the moon sometimes forced its way through the volumes of black clouds which yet hung over it my quickened senses caught its gleams to examine if any habitation or other hope of rescue was in view in vain i strained my sight the wood involved us entirely and every feeble hope died away when my eyes suddenly rested on  ah gracious heaven  our own recess  yes the wellknown entrance of the tomb presented itself and a thousand vague ideas of safety and danger mingling in my mind as the robbers approached the litter to take me out i screamed and swooned away  alas my sister call to mind your own feelings and guess at mine when i once more opened my eyes in the great room of our recess  that room once hallowed with the prayers of father anthony and the presence of mrs marlow  that room where once the portraits of our parents smiled peace and security on their now desolate offspring  how hideous was the change  its bare walls grimed with a thousand uncouth and frightful images presented only a faint picture of the present possessors on whose hardened faces i dared not fix my fearful eyes  considering me but as accidental plunder they were wholly engrossed by the old lord burleigh in whom some important view seemed to center i shrunk from the terrible scene and called upon the awful shades of those most dear to me to appal in turn the desperate wretches who made the timestruck walls resound with threats and execrations my shocked eyes sought the ground as a relief and fixed upon a wellknown object  it was that ring of mrs marlows with which father anthony wedded you to lord leicester and well i remembered that ring was on your hand when last we parted i stooped impatiently for it  my senses more fully recognized its setting  the dreadful truth flashed upon my mind alas my sister and lord leicester are alike ensnared groaned i forth without any consideration  well i know they must be here  oh in what dungeon have you hid them your sister fair lady returned one of the villains with an odious grin comrades our captain will thank us for this prize this must be she he talked so much about when the other travelers threw themselves into our hands  make yourself easy mistress your sister is locked up as safe as cords can keep her  all the anguish i had before felt became nothing at this moment my sister in this dungeon cried i oh born to suffer with me dear matilda how will that soft frame always unequal to the trials of life and now entirely debilitated support these horrors alas sirs if there is yet in your hearts one touch of human pity conduct me to this tender sufferer and let her die in my arms all in good time young woman replied another with an air so surly as awed even my convulsed soul to silence  lord burleigh still was their great object threats and oaths were exhausted on him when to consummate the terrors of that moment the name of williams reached me that name expounding both the past and future wrought my fears up to frenzy i cast my wild eyes around in search of any means to die and could in that terrible moment like portia have swallowed fire when a tumult without the room at once suspended that within it the sound of pistols the precipitate entrance of such of the robbers as were not already round us followed by many unknown persons instantly convinced me heaven had delivered us from our oppressors by some means less shocking to humanity than those despair had filled my thoughts with a dreadful contest ensued but our deliverers prevailing immediately began to unbind lord burleigh who almost mute with excessive surprise found in them a train of his own domestics from the adjoining abbey of st vincent which i understood was now one of his seats nor was their amazement less at meeting with their lord in this newlydiscovered den i comprehended the whole in a moment and plainly perceived the servants of lord burleigh must have come through the subterraneous passage that communicated with the abbey i recollected that it was unknown to williams nor doubted but you and lord leicester had escaped through it overwhelmed with the blessed events comprised in this deliverance i forgot i had any thing still to fear and no considering lord burleigh as my keeper i saw in him only a fellowsufferer i rose with alacrity and led the way to the dungeon which communicated with the abbey those who newly came from thence following me in silent astonishment i perceived the cords with which you and my lord had been bound and demanded you of the servants with a joyful impatience lord burleigh learnt from my incoherent transports a truth i had refused before to inform him of that chance had imprisoned us in the very spot where you and i were bred wholly taken up with my own exclamations and regardless of the silence of my followers i hailed the entrance of the abbey so long our happy asylum ah heavens how cruelly were these lively emotions repelled and extinguished when by the command of lord burleigh his servants once more seized me as a prisoner and attempted to lead me toward a remote apartment with a heart humbled and broken by so many successive frights and afflictions i sunk at his feet not disdaining the most submissive attitude and only solicited to see you i reminded him of the dangers he and i had shared together and conjured him to remember you alone could have opened the passage which led us all to freedom  unless he basely resolved to become to me a murderer as dreadful as those from whom we had just escaped inexorably cold he replied my unguarded acknowledgments only gave him stronger reason to imagine much was yet concealed and that whenever i would resolve to be wholly sincere i should not want his interest with his royal mistress breaking from those trembling hands which every moment more infeebled he ordered his servants to bear me into the grated room at the end of the eastern cloister you cannot but remember the dismal place half sunk in ruin and overhung with ivy and trees of growth almost immemorial it appeared the very cell of melancholy alas her pale representative took possession of it in myself the massy bars no sooner gave assurance that i was secure than my conductors impatiently flew to rejoin the rest and learn the news of the family to me that small relief was barbarously denied so near the cause and partaker of my sorrows they were destined to flow in solitude nor could imagination decide whether you were yet a prisoner or had again escaped how terrible are the vague suspicions of an impassioned mind when deprived of every means of certitude the pale gleams of the moon seemed every moment to people the dungeon they glanced through  my pulse beat with redoubled strength and quickness  the whole cloister resounded the long night with distant feet but they came not to me  fearfully i often started when sinking into a lethargy rather than slumber by the echo of some remote voice which fancy continually told me i knew but it died away ere memory could assign it an owner and though my fertile brain exhausted possibility the dawning day realized no other objects than those dreary ones my chamber presented the bats and owls began to retire to their haunts in my neighborhood and the short visit of the rising sun only showed me the limits of a dark and dismal prison by this time both mind and body were alike exhausted and a mist appeared to envelop my senses which still recall a thousand fleeting forms by turns surrounding me till fatigue threw me into a deep sleep  it was at length interrupted by a maid who brought me breakfast and a message from her lord that if i would inform him what was wanting to my comfort and accommodation his orders should immediately supply it i cast my eyes expressively around and bid her tell him in one word every thing the woman seemed affected i snatched the fortunate moment and putting my purse into her hand asked in return only to know the fate of lord leicester and my sister i learnt to my inexpressible relief both had by some incomprehensible means again escaped and that lord burleighs generous daughter was confined as their abettor a hasty summons to the maid left me once more alone but the news she had communicated and the idea that the amiable rose might hereafter be alike ready to relieve my distresses gave a new turn to my spirits which now gathered courage to retrace the past and look into the future  although unable to comprehend what the urgent motives could be which impelled lord leicester and my sister to so precipitate a flight every thing argued that they were desperate for that it was sudden and without preparation their intention of taking shelter in the recess strongly indicated and whenever i recollected the dangerous situation of matilda i shared with her that compassion self is but too apt to engross was there a spot of st vincents abbey however gloomy which did not call to my mind some instance of that integrity affection and nobility of heart which distinguished my matilda and could i remember these yet doubt that by whatever chance i was deserted your will could have no share in it believe me my sister the first prayers i addressed to heaven in my prison were for your safety  when time and solitude restored me reason enough coolly to consider my own state i saw no immediate danger it could teem with though a victim to the fears of elizabeth and the policy of lord burleigh i had not yet learnt to consider them as mere murderers and if they were not so imprisonment was the only evil i could have to apprehend nay even that might perhaps be short as it was undoubtedly both illegal and unjust malice itself could affix on me no other crime than that of being daughter to the queen of scots a fatal truth which elizabeth would gladly forget but surely never publish could i resolve therefore to endure with patience the punishment so unworthily imposed on me i might in time emerge unsullied to distinction i called upon the example of her who gave me being to support my drooping spirits and should perhaps have vied with her in fortitude but that one cherished grief wound round my aching heart and often wrung forth its dearest drops essex the most beloved of mankind that faithful lover whose ardent prayers whose generous proposals i had obstinately resisted when his irritated mind seemed daringly to lift the veil of futurity and pierce through those complicated dangers which followed our parting  ah what should guard him when my loss was discovered from giving way to his injured and exasperated affection if fortune should even separate him and lord leicester how could i be certain elizabeth herself would be safe from his reproaches and who was ever safe from her vengeance when once thus desperately awakened the premature fate of my muchhonoured father the noble norfolk returned upon my memory  the tower the dismal tower scaffolds axes a bleeding lover and a broken heart daily passed in long array before me and peopled the solitude to which i was so unjustly condemned  the decency with which i was attended and served convinced me both elizabeth and her minister had still terms to keep with me but the servant who had ventured to answer me was impeached by those who waited without the door and my purse being found upon her no doubt became a sufficient proof of guilt certainly i saw her no more and the women deputed in her place were either too guarded or too ignorant to inform me on any subject had i left myself money to try their fidelity  i had once been so accustomed to seclusion that it would soon have lost its horrors had my misfortunes rested here but resolved however not to augment them by vain and fruitless repining i demanded such books as might strengthen and amuse my mind thus opposing the wisdom of ages to the pangs of the moment by sharing a part of my food with the birds which inhabited the overhanging trees i drew around me some mute associates who more grateful than the superior beings that venture to look down on them are always attached by benefits  this lethargic tranquillity was soon interrupted by a visit from lord burleigh with the fair language of an experienced courtier he commended my resignation to an inevitable fate and admired the wise use i made of confinement in thus applying myself to enrich my understanding assuring me he went beyond his orders for my accommodation but that an express which arrived overnight from the queen had at last put it in his power to restore that liberty he had by her command deprived me of my heart leaped at so unhoped an alteration in my fate but he intercepted the transport ere it reached my lips and sent it back a dead weight into my bosom think not therefore fair lady said he that her majestys indulgence is unconditional  she wills if ever you pass these walls it is as the wife of lord arlington  they will then be my grave my lord returned i in bitterness of spirit shame on her indulgence inhuman tyrant  moderate your wrath resumed he in the same equal tone after your bold attempt to impose on her by forged testimonials of an impossible marriage and suppositious birth you ought rather to imagine she treats you with lenity   forged testimonials retorted i with great acrimony why then did she so carefully destroy them but she destroyed them my lord in vain  look down blessed spirits of those who once owned this noble mansion look down thou dear departed sister of the murdered norfolk  look down too revered mrs marlow thou gentle guardian of our youth and say to whom we owe our being  but why do i call the blessed from their reward to authenticate those rights the malice of elizabeth cannot annihilate oh royal mary dear unknown mother how would the tender yearnings of thy bosom justify the assertions of thy persecuted daughter did not a cruel tyrant by a double injustice enclose in separate prisons the mother and the child  bring us but together and you shall find  i am not commissioned to parley on so delicate a subject replied the crafty lord burleigh  ere you give way to these violent transports remember how fatal they may prove  over the head of the queen of scots the sword has long hung only by a single thread  it is now put into your hand  consider well ere next i see you who and what you will be with these tremendous words he rose and left me  left me  ah how convulsed annihilated a terror hitherto unknown seemed to fix every feature and freeze every sense oh thou whose awful will alone could authorize this nameless infliction give me strength to bear it sighed forth my shocked soul can i then deserve the title of daughter only by renouncing all claim to it  my mother my gracious royal mother who even when overwhelmed with woes did take such tender care of the little unfortunates to whom thou gave being ah were their lives preserved but to shorten thine meditations like these almost shook the seat of reason and i resolved to conform to the most inhuman command of elizabeth rather than suffer the horrible scene his last implication presented to pass another hour before my bewildered senses  it was surely at this tremendous crisis in my life my fermented blood first adopted and cherished those exuberances of passion which ever after warped the equality and merit of my character that blood now boiling in my veins joined with a disordered imagination to call around me a thousand visionary inconsistent forms to whose voices my burning heart responded  now slowly retreating to every vital source the very powers of being seemed to congeal and i remained for hours a breathing icicle whenever the first sensation actuated me the strong desire of saving my mother still returned and in these dire revolutions of constitution four and twenty dreadful hours elapsed  lord burleigh at the same time the next day came once more to learn my final resolution scarce able to reply or raise my heavy eyes from the ground in which they sought and saw only a grave my whole appearance strongly proved how i had passed the interval the desolate acquiescence my silence bespoke encouraged him to produce a paper he began reading it while rivetted with a new surprise i listened to the incredible and disgraceful forgery as if l had lost every other sense than that of ear it was called as i think the voluntary confession of ellinor on behalf of herself and sister matilda and set forth that soon after mary queen of scots sought shelter in england under the protection of her sister elizabeth for diverse politic and ambitious reasons as first in case her only son should die and leave her without issue on which to support her claim to great britain as well as to the kingdom she had lately abandoned next to attach to her interest the disloyal persons into whose charge she was given she resolved to pretend to have made a marriage with thomas howard duke of norfolk and by the aid and confederacy of his sister the lady scroope whose lord was her keeper together with that of diverse scottish servants as well as of one gertrude marlow the bastard sister of lord scroope the said queen of scots did feign a pregnancy and in process of time a delivery of two daughters who were with the assistance of the said confederates brought up in secresy by the said gertrude marlow till such time as mary should judge fit to produce them and that sundry testimonials were invented drawn and witnessed by said parties tending to legitimate said surreptitious offspring at the pleasure of the queen of scots by the names of matilda and ellinor the said ellinor understanding in process of time the above plausible collusion and sorely repenting the offense against elizabeth queen of england her lawful lady and sovereign does on behalf of herself and sister matilda freely acknowledge and solemnly affirm that they do not believe themselves born of the said mary queen of scots but have reason to know their parents of a low degree who for the lucre of gain resigned them for ever to be done with as the said queen of scots and her confederates thought best this declaration is made and signed on the spot where ellinor owns herself and sister were thus secretly brought up to wit the abbey of st vincent the seat of the late lord scroope in the presence of etc having concluded this notable memorial of villainy he summoned several domestics and put a pen into my hand my unsubdued indignant soul spurned at the idea of villifying both myself and mother even to save her life i would have spoke but ere grief and rage could be converted into language he transfixed me with a look and holding before my eyes an order for the execution of the queen of scots signed dated authentic complete in every form my shuddering nature could not endure the conflict i rashly scrawled my name and snatching that tremendous mandate he yet held before me tore it into a thousand atoms and sunk upon the ground in the most violent convulsions they were so rapid and dreadful that to have left me alone had been little else than murder his domestics attended me with a humanity unknown to their lord and these fits at last gave place to a frenzy fever alas during its raging paroxysms i doubtless continually confuted the infamous tale i had witnessed for every affecting remembrance pressed upon my confused and weakened mind  my mother my sister and my love by turns bled before my eyes and death presented himself in every form dear to me while i vainly invoked him to take my own  exhausted nature seemed to rest on the very verge of the grave  ah had i then sunk into it how many pangs had i been spared  the care of my attendants so far recovered me as to enable me to quit my bed when pronouncing me well they left me to my own meditations  a hideous train my sister  to add to their bitterness fancy had now thrown a new color on my fate  how if this infamous forgery had been extorted from me only to stigmatize my sister and myself  a still more aggravating idea sprung from that  what should prevent elizabeth from presenting to the eyes of the unfortunate queen of scots a defamatory declaration which must give her a stab no less mortal than the blow it saved her from though perhaps more slow how indeed if so could i hope she would ever forget or forgive an instance of depravity apparently as unaccountable as it was shocking finally oh grief yet more pungent might not the queen take pleasure in wringing the haughty soul of essex by showing him the unhappy object of his dearest affections for ever stigmatized by her own hand  this painful assemblage of ideas and objects was too much for my hurt brain  i groaned i shrieked i relapsed and very nearly obtained the relief i so much longed for  impelled thus by tyranny down the precipice of fate my swift course seemed ready to bury me in the gulf it overhangs when another projecting point interposed and suddenly stopped me  i recollected that in thus resigning myself to the stroke i rendered the last fatal blot my own hand had fixed on my character indelible that while i lived i had yet a chance of justifying my intention in an act which reflected alike on myself and all dear to me by a weakness for which i cannot account i suddenly became more willing to support all the evils of a life thus prolonged than the idea of an unknown end and unhonored grave  my constitution destined to struggle with still greater calamities sunk not wholly under the impression of these but the period of recovery was marked by a gloom and dejection i can never forget silence was now no less my habit than inclination and i often fancied myself incapable of speaking lord burleigh by a second visit called together every enfeebled power remaining regarding my altered countenance with an air of insidious pity he lamented the painful duty imposed on him by the queen estranged from sympathy so long that the least mark of it affected me i sunk into languor and tears unhappy young creature resumed he destined every way to condemn yourself hear all i am commissioned now to say and finally decide your own fate i need hardly inform you on whatever grounds your connection with the queen of scots is founded a due regard for herself and the peace of the kingdom of england will not allow my royal mistress to enlarge one whose high spirit and distinguished understanding must so greatly aid whatever cause she is a party in but when the attachment between you and the earl of essex is considered whose ambition and daring temper sufficiently alarm the prudent part of the queens counselors unassisted as he yet is by any imaginary rights it is obvious that one way alone can you hope for freedom at the dear name of essex to which my ear had been so long estranged every emotion that had gathered slowly toward my heart spread in wild perturbation through my frame i faintly repeated it but lord burleigh motioned me to silence and i confined to contemptuous glances my opinion of the remainder of his speech  i shall not conceal from you returned he that essex had influence enough over the queen to make her for a while suppress her sentiments on this error in his conduct perhaps she would have trusted to time for otherwise matching you but that this hotheaded rash young man  i groaned in impatient silence  he cast on me an attentive eye and pursued his subject  after finding it vain to hope he should discover your asylum for which i must tell you he spared neither threats entreaties money or assiduity he completely irritated elizabeth by uniting himself in a plot to release the queen of scots providentially for my royal mistress it transpired in time and the traitors are taken the chief object of her indignation must of course be him she so greatly favored convinced you are the only cause of his rebellious practices nothing but your making another choice can save him from expiating them on the block a fond weakness renders elizabeth still anxious to preserve him for my own part i confess the safest remedy i shall always think the best  ah let him live groaned i adopting at once the train of ideas he so artfully arranged though not for me even elizabeth is merciful and shall i then condemn him rob the world of an unequalled ornament only because i am not permitted to possess it  i will no more haunt her slumbers  i will no more gild his  of what consequence is the name i am called by during the few days i linger in this miserable world inform me my lord but how i can save him  the same reasons that concur in obliging the queen to separate you and essex said the crafty burleigh will equally prevent her from matching you with any man gifted with his aspiring qualities yet as it is not her wish wholly to debase you lord arlington was to me the messenger of her will i shuddered at the fatal name the bounded capacity he possesses is one motive for her choosing him as it ensures her own safety and his titles and fortunes another as those are distinctions she is not willing to deprive you of you marry him or he returns directly and his return is the signal for lord essexs execution  yet weak and unrecovered my mind wanted firmness to enter into all the reasons which should regulate my conduct alas i saw no more of my own fate than was inseparably interwoven with that of my lover  urged by the generous excesses of which i knew his heart capable he has for my sake then endangered his honor liberty and life perhaps that danger is exaggerated hinted prudence  but oh if not  if actuated by fear and rage elizabeth should condemn him to the block as she already had my father for no greater crime  my wounded soul shrunk from the bare idea  long faintings and delirium followed  fancy realized every image fraud had presented i seemed to behold every moment the chosen of my heart tried sentenced executed i drenched the maimed yet beauteous form my eyes for ever worshipped in my tears and hardly could be persuaded during my lucid intervals that he yet lived and that his fate still depended on my determination  lord burleigh faithful to the ungenerous trust reposed in him and weary of the task of confining me took a willing advantage of the weakened state of my intellects to wring from me a compliance with the wish of elizabeth i was now released from my prison and the chaplain and family being assembled lord arlington was introduced the contracts signed and a tearful midnight marriage abruptly solemnized during which my abstracted mind pursued a thousand distant ideas  wedded  lost  annihilated  the woeful mistress of a magnificent solitude where my inward eyes traced for ever the revered steps of those who were no longer to be found on earth one only consolation could my exhausted heart supply i die that essex may live  i sigh that he may breathe freely  but oh such sighs they seemed to tincture with blackness and melancholy the very air that received them lord arlington wanted judgment alike to subdue the deep regrets of silent sufferance or to yield to them my mind could never hold any correspondence with his and by this means alone was i ignorant for a time of a calamity which when known totally overwhelmed me  alas my sister by a refinement in barbarity our fainted mother was led to execution almost at the very moment i was defaming you and myself to save her this climax of grief and misfortune was too mighty for my reason  i had passed from fear to fear from sorrow to sorrow in such rapid succession that there were only intervals enough of time to render each more poignant in one short month to behold myself deceived defamed and sacrificed  i blended the bitter tears of selflove with those of filial duty and affection the idea of essex remained engrained on my heart and doubled every agonizing sensation lord arlington however returned to court and gave me the little relief of solitude  severed at once from every tie both of nature and of choice dead while yet breathing the deep melancholy which seized upon my brain soon tinctured my whole mass of blood  my intellects strangely blackened and confused frequently realized scenes and objects that never existed annihilating many which daily passed before my eyes i sometimes observed the strong surprise of my attendants when i spoke of these visions but much oftener i remained lethargic and insensible there were moments when i started as from a deep sleep and oh how deep a sleep is that of the soul  turned my dubious eyes around with vague remembrance  touched my own hand to be convinced i yet existed  trembled at the sound of my own voice or raising my uncertain eye toward the blue vault of heaven found in the allchearing sun a stranger  alas my sister look no more in this sad recital for the equalminded rational ellinor you once saw me sensations too acute for either endurance or expression from this fatal period blotted every noble facility often substituting impulse for judgment always sensible of my wandering the moment it was past shame continually succeeded and united every misery of madness and reason  spring reviving all nature extends its genial influence even to the withered heart  my intervals became more calm and frequent i gathered strength to walk into the garden  there i slowly retraced to myself the fatal whole and began to find or fancy it more supportable that i had been a dupe to elizabeth and her minister was too obvious but i was willing to acquit the weak man perhaps sufficiently punished in a wife like me of having been a confederate in their plots i had long been the object of his choice and it is a common error among his sex to be careless of the means by which their views succeed provided they attain them but my feeble effort toward recovery requiring every indulgence i wrote to lord arlington assuring him i would make the best use of my returning reason in forming my heart to the future performance of those painful duties a combination of fatal circumstances had imposed on it but that the task was too difficult not to claim every allowance on his part and concluded with hoping solitude would enable me one day to meet him with feelings less embittered  with my intellectual powers too returned my affections the mystery of your fate my sister and that of lord leicester racked my weary imagination in vain i enclosed in the letter to lord arlington a billet to lady pembroke it contained only an enquiry for you  when these letters were dispatched i bent my every thought to fulfilling the promise made in the first a thousand times on my knees i besought the almighty to confirm those upright sentiments he alone could inspire i strove to obliterate every remembrance of the human means by which his will was effected and considering it only in the light of his will tried meekly to submit to it alas the answer of lady pembroke shook every just determination  astonishment terror and affection were obvious in every line of it  eagerly she solicited news of myself and the incomprehensible means which first restored me to st vincents abbey as well as those which fixed me there by so extraordinary a marriage  from her letter i at last understood a part of your motives for so suddenly absenting yourselves i found too you had happily arrived in france by the accounts many had received from you when all at once she added the correspondence broke off and every effort at renewing it only increased the sadness and perplexity of your friends that le val having obeyed the orders left by his lord in hastening to kenilworth came on from thence to the recess which he found thrown open as well as that his lord had infallibly been there not able to gather any further information he came back to london there to wait lord leicesters directions but none arriving this extraordinary and alarming silence induced the faithful steward to return to his native country in search of his lord fear and grief having however seized upon his heart a bad passage wrought both up to a crisis and he died immediately on his landing that every other messenger and friend had been equally unsuccessful though many had traced you as far as rouen nor had the mystery of your fate ever yet transpired though lord leicester was admitted to be dead by every body it was given out he expired in his way to kenilworth castle certainly he was there laid in state and afterward interred at warwick but notwithstanding this report was apparently believed as having the weight of the queens credence the strongest doubts arose in the minds of his friends and relations upon her seizing kenilworth castle and various possessions of his as a security for sums due to her a conduct little agreeing with the indulgence she had for so many years shown toward him in fine having bribed the servants employed in blazoning this pompous fiction the family were indubitably assured the body buried under the name of lord leicester was one procured for that purpose  almost petrified by this mysterious and affecting recital i strove in vain to expound it that lord leicester was dead could hardly be doubted but when where or how imagination could not fathom yet the conduct of the queen proved her too well informed ah where then is now my matilda where then that more unfortunate being than even myself convinced by a comparison of circumstances that your death would alike have been published but that by some undiscoverable event you survived your lord i was led to conclude some convent in france still supplied you a grave to groan in yet even if so why bury with you that knowledge for want of which so many affectionate hearts have been racked  alas my darling sister year after year have i vainly repeated to myself this one affecting question  emerge i beseech you if yet an inhabitant of this world and satisfy a fearful heart which achs with fondness nay if translated to a better and yet sensible of aught sublunary oh deign to inform me how often in the depth of midnight when the happier world are at rest have i called upon thee impelled by an affection incapable of fear  but all was awful silence  no voice replied to me  no form obtruded on the deep gloom where sight itself is lost  yet the days that elapse in incertitude pass not in vain they insensibly urge forward one ordained to clear up every doubt  i dreamt of essex  ah what did i say i dreamt of essex  alas i have dreamt of him my whole life long  something strangely intervenes between myself and my meaning  no matter i am too stupefied now to explain it  oh these cruel wanderings  but i dare not attempt to correct or avoid them lest in the very effort reason evaporate and one inconsiderate stroke should confuse my whole story  alas lady pembroke how could you venture to tell me lord essex was married  and to lady sydney too  gracious heaven i made myself a wretch then only to crown her future days with unspeakable happiness  at this idea overwhelming passion breaks the feeble boundaries of reason and religion sweeping away inferior sorrows  my mother  my sister  alas those ties so dear so revered serve only to swell the flood that sinks them  hence agonizing sensations  i have drawn them up matilda in one weighty sigh  ah surely my heart escaped unawares at the same moment it has left such a fearful void within  yes my sister essex is indeed married that very essex for whom i more than died  and privately too  the sacred tender union had every charm but honor  for lady sydney he incurred the anger of the vindictive queen  gracious heaven i thank thee for that thought  it was not for me  no i was dying withering at the heart far from the most false  ah still the most beloved of his sex  that little thought strangely consoles me  rather indeed would i have died than have been a spot upon that radiant sun my dim eyes no more must look up to  i perceive i have in the wild colorings of a disordered imagination unfolded a truth my heart almost burst with  this thunderstroke concluded lady pembrokes second letter  how deep how dreadful was its effect  tranquillity health reason all fled before it  to the evils fate imposes however grievous our nature insensibly accommodates itself but oh when the arrows of calamity are winged by love and dipped in poison by friendship the wounds they make always gangrene the idea of deceit ingratitude and unkindness irritated and preyed on me continually  it brought on another greenland winters night which lasted many lingering months and in recovering i seemed to acquire a new disposition  i had lost with my equanimity all sweetness of temper  revenge seemed the only principle which supported my being and i nourished a project in secret long ere i could bring it forward wonder not at this alteration my sister misfortune serves but to soften the soul injury alone can render it callous ah strange that we should at the very moment imbibe the vice by which we suffer  lord arlington early in the spring revisited st vincents abbey my resentments being levelled at a dear and distant object i behaved toward him when mistress of my intellects with a melancholy graciousness which made him fancy them restored and propose taking me with him to london when necessity obliged him to return i acquiesced with readiness as this was the very point to which i wished to bring him and my unexpected compliance flattering the egregious selflove that marked his character he was charmed with the effect without examining into the cause he was easily persuaded that decorum would demand my being presented at court and undertook to propose it to elizabeth while lady pembroke amazed alike at all she heard and all she saw steadily opposed a project fraught with so many painful uncertainties but it was the passion of lord arlington to mortify essex and conceiving that only in his power by presenting to his eyes the dear object fatal circumstances had robbed him of and others yet more fatal had wedded to himself he soon became as interested in my wish as if his own heart had dictated it the queen heard it as i foresaw with surprise and declined it with scorn but she soon found i had skill enough to manage even the fool she had selected for me who persisted in quitting the court if she denied him the compliment due to his birth elizabeth had now put her peace so far into his power that she dared not entirely break with him and fearful lest the black history hid in my heart should be published to the world were she to urge her imprudent refusal she at last reluctantly consented to receive me i heard this with a bitterness of spirit i once thought myself incapable of and brooded over the dreary triumph i had so long projected  i deferred appearing at court from time to time till certain lord essex was returned from the camp alas the universal pleasure that return excited aggravated my deep and increasing resentment distinguished now with the same partiality elizabeth once showed to your lord loaded with honors in his own person and the chief medium through which others obtained them essex conducted himself with such nobleness as endeared him even to those whom he failed to serve while the happy few who won his confidence looked up to him as to a being of a superior kind i i alone dared silently to impeach his generosity his honor his integrity wearied with an everlasting discussion of his merits in all companies and not daring to utter one syllable on the subject lest groans should take place of language i often testified an impatience lord arlington construed into an extinction of that fatal passion i once entertained for his rival and a due regard for the rights which he had acquired over me charmed with this idea lord arlington became lavish in the jewels and other customary ornaments and the tranquillity with which i prepared to appear lulled every suspicion to sleep alas while they were adorning me with the costly habiliments selected on the occasion i took a malicious pleasure in tracing the ravages grief had already made in my features constitution and figure the first shrunk wan and withered the latter emaciated beyond all concealment i knew however those who saw me every day might deceive themselves in presenting this shadow to his eyes whose ardent heart once touched with colors yet more glowing a form then rich with the gifts of nature youth and hope  oh well i knew what volumes of reproaches were contained in a single look  i entered the presence chamber with an air of determination grandeur and composure astonishing even to myself my soul found him she alone sought in a moment essex was resting one arm on the back of the queens chair in the same familiar gay and graceful attitude i had so often seen lord leicester assume his dress bold magnificent and martial his features oh those fatal features destined to subdue alike my wise and erroneous resolutions lighted up by every emotion youth softness pride and pleasure ever blended his fine eyes lightly glancing over each surrounding object fixed at last on me  fixed i may well say  how deep how deadly was the effect of that single look  his unfinished speech to the queen became annihilated while his quivering lips in broken sounds breathed forth unutterable anguish  surprise tenderness grief  ah more than grief  agony  chased away the bright expression of happiness from every perfect feature and flooded his eyes in a moment  no longer remembering the place the queen the circle he started forward and almost in the act of kneeling felt the absurdity and vanished  with him too vanished every trace of that misapplied reason which had so strongly impelled me to this strange revenge they told me i suffered myself to be led to the chair of the queen who no sooner in the common form presented me her hand than i haughtily repelled it and fixing my eyes on her with a dreadful meaning gave a deep groan and sunk senseless at her feet elizabeth started up in high indignation and reproaching lord arlington as not less mad than myself in thus obtruding me upon her retired precipitately to her closet not much more sensible than myself through astonishment at a conduct so unexpected on my part he soon so far recovered his faculties as to take the advice of his friends in trying to appease the queen committing me to the care of those around me by this means alone he escaped witnessing a scene which touched the sensibility of every spectator my friends bore me through the great gallery as the way most convenient in the antichamber leading to it the unhappy lover i had taken a barbarous satisfaction in wounding had thrown himself on a couch to recover at leisure a presentiment of the fact as the crowd approached made him eagerly start up and resigning himself to the impression of the moment he rushed through them all and snatching me with impetuosity from those who held me placed me on the couch and kneeling beside it sought to reanimate my chilled senses with burning tears and agonized embraces a thousand times he called me his dear betrothed love  his murdered precious ellinor  here is some black artifice some diabolical villainy in this business would he cry starting up haughtily and throwing his inflamed eyes around in dreadful search of him who happily was absent oh if i find it so added he they shall not scape who severed us by vague and rash exclamations he thus published the chief incident in our unhappy story while i alone still insensible heard not the wellknown voice i once fancied the grave only could close my ear to  this scene which every following moment threatened to make fatal was at last interrupted by the appearance of lady pembroke the excellent understanding of that amiable woman had made her from the first consider my desire of appearing at court even while unapprized of its motives as the wild start of an unsettled mind she had employed entreaty and argument in vain to make me give it up finding the project alike agreeable to lord arlington and myself she became silent on the subject but declined accompanying me and dreading some strange event retired to her own apartments in the palace to tremble for it in secret the news of my having frightened the queen and broke up the court immediately reached her there however offended at my obstinacy she was shocked at its effects and readily emerged to serve and save me if possible pressing through the astonished crowd the fond extravagance of lord essex continually increased she beheld me in his arms and heard his lamentation amazement in her collected mind is but a momentary emotion what are you doing my lord said she with an air which recalled even him  is this the way to recover the senses or reason of this dear unfortunate remember the respect due both to her and yourself and leave her entirely to my care neither prayers nor anger warped her from rectitude she commanded her servants to bear me to her barge and followed me herself the distracted essex held her by force and vainly solicited leave to attend me with a dignity which eminently distinguishes that charming woman she chid him for a madness not less extravagant than my own though far more censurable and requested her lord to pay him an equal attention  the women who followed me into the barge sprinkled me with water that and the open air gradually revived those faculties so long dormant they seemed gone for ever i feebly lifted my head from the bosom of lady pembroke and wondered awhile how i came there a thousand gloomy uncertainties occurred to me and a flood of tears at last so far relieved me as to suffer my mind to fix on the fact lady pembroke perceiving i was capable of attending to her spared me the trouble of enquiring into the past scene by relating it with such comments as an enlarged mind and tender heart would naturally dictate my pulses were yet low and her gentle admonitions made a due impression review the whole of this wild scheme my dear ellinor said she and i think you will unite with me in calling it so the queen beyond your revenge in this world can amply retaliate on every one dear to you for the temporary alarms and vexations you cause her from the eyes of the noble essex you have snatched away a bandage which saved both him and yourself from danger i have hitherto suffered you to imagine him unfaithful and guilty because anger in your situation must be a much less dangerous emotion than love his whole soul is once more awakened and i would in vain now affect to deceive either  he will be heard  he will even be seen if to the rash ardor of his temper you do not oppose the most inflexible prudence  alas my sweet friend what direful conflicts do i see before you  conflicts the strong and untried soul would wish to shrink from  how then shall your wounded spirit  fear not answered i nerved by the occasion my dear my watchful monitress born for conflict i seem only to exist by that mental action and though i lament with you the invincible obstinacy which has once more thus involved me yet believe me i seem better able to bear every evil which may result from the vindication of essex than the dreadful weight of his supposed ingratitude for every other evil i had been accustomed to prepare my heart  that heart cherished by tears and softness started not into excess and insanity till those sources were dried up ah open again every sluice of pleasure  tell me essex is indeed innocent unaltered  tell me he is still the incomparable being my youthful fancy first worshipped  tell me in short the whole truth and see if my soothed senses are not equal to the confidence  how little reason do these eager exclamations these impassioned tears and glowing cheeks give me to think so wistfully replied the sweet lady pembroke perhaps were it yet in my choice i should still resolve to deceive you but in now revealing all i am only beforehand with him who in tenderly urging a just vindication of his conduct would effectually reestablish himself in your affections to the utter ruin of the little peace heaven has allowed you  the desperate state of my health at the time yourself and sister so unaccountably vanished made my lord guard against my obtaining that information with the utmost caution and the first alarm i received was from the sudden return and perpetual visits of the earl of essex these were often at odd and improper hours and generally began or ended with a private conference a continuance of this conduct even after i was able to quit my apartment gave me a disgust to your lover i did not conceal from my lord he pleaded his unhappiness as his only and indeed sufficient excuse and thus laid himself open to my enquiries which soon obliged him to own the whole truth its deep effect on me made lord pembroke congratulate himself on having thus long concealed it my agitation and affection soon reconciled me to essex and united me in his views wholly engrossed by the hope of finding you every day gave birth to a new project in one or the other how many disappointments did we experience yet the fertility of his imagination being only equalled by the warmth of his heart no toil discouraged him and adopting all his aerial plans i urged him to perseverance taking pleasure in heaping fuel on a flame prudence should rather have stifled news happily arrived of lord leicester and matilda which renovating every hope in both him and me i joined the deluder self in assuring him he was destined to restore you to the noble exiles and in receiving your hand to unite himself at once in their happiness and fate  the romantic heroism interwoven in his character made him readily listen to these pleasing delusions till a strange rumor reached us one day that you had been married to lord arlington in the presence of lord burleigh and left by him at st vincents abbey impressed with the strongest reliance on your faith essex asserted it in the warmest terms and seemed ready to fly to the spot where it was reported you yet existed the paleness of my countenance reproved his implicit confidence the name of burleigh the remembrance arlington had lately quitted the court that intuitive sense which arranges and combines a thousand important nothings tending to stamp a sad conviction more instantaneously than one can pronounce a sentence now told me that this was true  lord pembroke proposed going to the minister and thus deciding the point we gladly consented and essex traversing the room in great agitation during the interval found a thousand reasons to justify his opinion so cautiously collected as showed he was not without a secret fear lord pembroke at length returned and confirming the fatal news added lord burleigh had shown him the contract signed by both but what was the paleness impressed on my countenance to that which spread over the florid complexion of your lover at this fatal confirmation the silent struggle in his soul surely combined every pang of death without affording its relief  speech and color at last returned his complexion now glowed with indignation while his lips trembled with transports of bitterness and grief he quitted us precipitately and my lord devoting himself to assuage my sorrow was not immediately sensible of the departure of our friend alas could either of us possibly have suspected the fate the untoward fate that awaited him  the moment lord essex thus abruptly quitted our house he hastened to that of sir francis walsingham where he found only lady sydney who secretly as sensible of his merit as she had before been of my brothers received him with equal surprise and pleasure without entering into the motives which influenced his conduct he eagerly tendered himself to her acceptance her objections were those of one who wished to be persuaded and he would neither hear of demur or delay his own chaplain was quickly summoned and the marriage solemnized in a manner almost as sudden and solitary as your own  ah fatal marriages both beginning and ending in tears  this news broke upon us with the morning lord pembroke was astounded i recommended to him to hasten to the wretched bridegroom and reconcile his mind to the unlucky choice he had thus precipitately made ere rash expressions of grief or disappointment should rouse that turbulent spirit which made my amiable brothers philosophy so soon give way to disgust well we knew the fiery soul of essex would spurn at such a bondage however voluntary  the contempt and coldness both lord pembroke and myself had always shown to this imperious woman who first introduced discord into a family before distinguished by unanimity rendered this a great effort of friendship the time lost in reconciling our feelings to the condescension made it wholly useless my lord found sir francis almost annihilated with surprise and understood at once that his daughter was in fits and lord essex gone unable wholly to conceal the anguish that preyed on his spirits and flattering himself a generous confidence in his bride might in time cement their union by the charm of esteem at least essex had laid open his whole heart to her the mortal hatred she ever entertained both for yourself and sister she wanted judgment at this period to stifle the melancholy essex who sought for pity not passion incautiously defended her he had unwarily arraigned the vindictive temper of his bride blazed forth in all its littleness and the quarrel rose so high that early the next morning he ordered his horses and calling her at once his error and his punishment he took his leave with the bitter remark that he followed in all things the fate of sir philip sydney a reproach like this might well shock the most callous heart it threw lady essex into fits  regardless of this her lord mounted and departing with the utmost swiftness was soon out of the reach both of friends and enemies  the queen who was every day more partial to essex than she had been the former one insensibly had suffered him to take both in her heart and court the place of lord leicester it was the opinion of many that she intended to marry him and the rage this step of his excited in her lent force to the extravagant conjecture deeply resenting alike his hasty marriage and abrupt departure she banished his lady the court nor did sir francis escape a reprimand however undeserving it  essex soon fitted out some ships with which he joined drake and norris and his fame daily endearing him more to the queen she could hardly support that appearance of resentment she thought due to his temerity and incessantly languished for his return  we soon had letters from the earl acknowledging the rash step he had taken in marrying and that to avoid blushing for it in our presence he had thus exiled himself though pride made him still speak of you with acrimony it was obvious from the tenor of the whole letter that he had quitted england no less to avoid seeing you than living with the woman he had invested with a legal right to make him unhappy the generous anxiety he showed for your sister in sending even at this juncture sir walter curtis once more to rouen with directions to spare neither trouble or money to discover matilda was another new instance of that nobility of mind which always graces even his faults consecrating his cares to a more noble pursuit than love he thus sought to fill up the void the aching void that blighted passion had left in his heart  he was not born for inaction and soon his daring spirit employed the thoughts of the whole nation when elizabeth who knew too well its present exertions were but the wild efforts of disappointment and despair relaxed at once from all her apparent rigor and recalled him disgust had sunk so deep that he still hesitated and nothing but her peremptory command could induce him to return while in daily expectation of him i received your first letter it contained not a word could inform me of your real situation or the motives of an action so eccentric as your acceptance of lord arlington your long silence your obscure and laconic epistle the strong desire i had to see tranquillity restored to yourself and your lover though happiness had escaped both made me resolve to show him the letter in which he was not even named if once the subject arose from this i guessed he would most probably conclude the union with your own free will as well as the retired style of your present life an opportunity soon offered nor was i mistaken in my judgment lord essex perused it in silent astonishment and the conviction it conveyed produced a surprising alteration in his mind and manners no symptom of either pride passion or disappointment from that moment has been visible in his conduct conforming at once to his fate he profited by the indulgence of the queen and resolved to live decently with his wife if not happily never since have i heard your name from his lips  i knew not it lived even in his heart and finding this artifice so successful with one i resolved to try it with the other when you related to me the cruel fiction by which lord burleigh wrought upon your feelings what purpose would it have answered to inform you essex was never concerned in any plot  never imprisoned much less condemned the high sense you entertained of a sacrifice apparently unvalued by him made it improbable any explanation or even conversation should take place between minds thus deeply and justly offended with each other how then was i chagrined to see you on your arrival in london fondly nourish some unfathomable project which threatened wholly to defeat mine finding all advice ineffectual i thought it most judicious to leave your mind to its own workings hoping the gentleness of your nature would counteract the irritation of your passions alas my dear this fatal day shows me my error and its extent in how many ways will you now wound the noble heart of essex  tortured at once with the anguish of disappointed injured love the narrow doubts of his untractable wife and the arrogant vigilance of the queen his life will from this moment be as devoid of comfort as it has long been of hope  the tender motives which dictated this late confession as well as the past concealment the melancholy inference with which lady pembroke concluded all made a deep impression and opened every sluice of tenderness to the great relief of my oppressed and burning heart no my generous amiable friend returned i in a more equal tone than lady pembroke expected i cannot misconstrue conduct which has ever had the most upright intention and in doing justice to that of the afflicted essex you supply me motives for an exertion i should otherwise sink under the necessity for preventing a part of the evils my imprudence may occasion will recall me to reason honor and myself  oh thou cried i melting into tears too dearly beloved too deeply lamented pardon me if i pass a dark and dewy cloud over the bright star of thy distinguished fortune soon will it emerge with undiminished splendour while i alone shall drop in tears enriching the earth that hides me  and thou too most favored among women in being born to share his fate endeavor but to make it happy and she who has no use for life but to weep thy lot will join to crown it with every earthly felicity i find my fluctuating mind unequal to entering further on the interesting subject concluded i on arriving at home adieu my dear lady pembroke be this embrace the pledge of mutual pardon and if you have not blushed for the last as well as first time for your poor friend her better self must again desert her she strained me to the purest bosom that ever beat and left me once more alone with that unstable counselor my own erring heart  the return of lord arlington exasperated by the rage of the queen and the surmises of the court tried my firmest resolutions perhaps even those would have been unequal to the conflict but that i remembered my promise to lady pembroke and was determined to supply a bright example to that noble lover i now considered as equally unfortunate with myself i remained from this period wholly at home yet not without expecting some intelligence from lord essex though i knew not how he could possibly convey it it reached me at last in the most extraordinary manner lady pembroke seized the first interval of loneliness to address me perplexed circumstances make strange emissaries said she sighing  who would have imagined i should request to convey the letter of lord essex to you ellinor but finding him determined on thus addressing you i voluntarily undertook the trust as well to judge of all that passed as to prevent his humiliating himself and you to whatever servant he could bribe and perhaps if he erred in his choice of a messenger it would be to the ruin of your peace and reputation  hardly hearing this generous preamble my eager eyes were fixed on the letter and i gave the fair hand that held it the spontaneous kiss i was at first tempted to bestow on the precious paper  ah how affecting were the emotions produced by the sight of that wellknown hand his language was impassioned and incoherent  he accused himself me the friends of both and the overruling fate which actuated all he seemed assured fraud mystery and a thousand yet unknown execrable arts had been combined to separate us he conjured me to discover both the persons and the means he spoke of lord arlington rather as a weak tool in the hands of his more crafty enemies than the object of that deep and eternal resentment which only slept till i supplied it one scorn continued he the narrow prejudices of custom and your sex nor be wholly the sacrifice of situation dare to be sincere and think an adherence to your first sacred vows vows dear as inviolable the true point of honor of religion and morality oh call to mind the fatal moment when you tore yourself inexorably from arms that beauteous form no more perhaps shall fill  a little confidence a little faith had then made both happy now alas they can only make us less miserable yet speak my betrothed love concluded he  tell me all  once more i conjure you by those rights your falsehood or death alone can annul tell me all and by your care of the life which throbs within this agitated bosom give me a motive for wishing it to linger there  as i perused this touching transcript of his soul mine melted within me  nevertheless i resolved to act up to the idea i had formed and snatching a pen i thus replied to him  in giving you my heart my lord i own i gave you a right in every action of my life which though events may suspend they cannot annihilate  alas the only right i reserved to myself was that of concealing aught which might render you unhappy suffer me then to bury in this bosom the combination of fatal events which tore us from each other need i tell you they have wrung it even to phrenzy for nothing less could have justified the premeditated shock i cruelly gave you the deep effect of my presence  perhaps for why should i conceal it that of your own join with a severe duty in telling me while thus circumstanced we must meet no more the world a busy partial judge delights in beholding the execution of those painful sentences it imposes ah chosen of my soul remember its afflictions can only be completed by your failing in the arduous trial i am otherwise resolved to sustain rob me not of the melancholy pleasure fortune still allows me in whatever solitude i am henceforth buried of thinking him i selected from all mankind was every thing but an angel  above the slavery of opinion i know no guide but rectitude that tells me heaven itself will approve the efforts i yet make to charm you to life to greatness and to glory  oh awful father of universal being whose will alone could snatch from each the only object in creation sanctify to the noblest purpose these dictates of my reason and form both for the separate lots appointed us elevate the passions of my essex above the little motives of revenge or malice  sublime his love into philanthropy his rage into heroism  and oh on the frail heart which now bleeds before thee bestow patience and resignation so to pass each long day as if the next were to unite me to him i solicit not strength to expel him from that heart  no rather may he ever continue its sole object but be his conduct so ennobled that when both are called with the whole world before thy dread tribunal i may look down on the misjudging part of it and truly say  father it is not essex i have loved but virtue in his person  this passionate apostrophe however highly wrought in the cool judgment of lady pembroke was even in her opinion entirely calculated for the romantic spirit to whom it was addressed i earnestly besought the amiable essex to suffer this to end the correspondence which admitted not an indulgence beyond those conveyed in the letter and gave it into the hands of my friend with that sweet sense of selfapplause which ever attends the consciousness of having gone beyond a painful duty  yes still this dear sensation remains to me  it irradiates at intervals the deep gloom which steeps my soul and annihilates my senses  i fear i begin again to wander for my hand writing appears to my own eyes that of essex  oh how tight my head my heart seems bound  will no one loosen the shrunk fibers  hark is not that this queen  no  it was but the deep voice of the winters wind  poor essex  and did my letter thus deeply affect him  did he so fondly press it to his lips  did he blister it with his tears those i have shed for thee essex would have drowned thee had they been treasured  unequalled ellinor  oh most adored  yes i will pursue the bright wanderings of the pure mind i have assisted to unsettle and be all she wishes me from this moment  who told him i wandered then i wonder  i am sure i always strove against it before him  ah dear and precious sentiments how my soul imbibes the charm  have you not a penknife lady pembroke to write these words in my heart  on my very heart  oh i would have them sink deep  deep  would feel as well as see them  and thou too memory treacherous memory for once do thou retain the pleasant tone of the voice that repeated them  not even lady pembrokes own is so harmonious  married to lord arlington did you say  oh such a marriage  what did he gain by villainy and fraud the insupportable society of a wild wretch whose weary spirit threatened every moment to escape and leave in his arms the vile dross he thus purchased  and yet they tell me it is so  he drags me about with him still and calls me his  his oh heavens  but i am nobodys else mark that  mark that or we shall perhaps have murder and i not there to step between the fatal swords and see which will befriend me  matilda i have not told you about that i think  but i am not very able just now such a heavy sleepiness seals up every faculty  and yet if i dont now i never may wake more you know  but i have waked over and over again now i recollect till i am quite tired and so for once i will sink quietly into a slumber and dream of you  let me snatch a moment of reason and recollection to forward my story  in pursuance of the good resolutions i had formed i requested leave of lord arlington to reside for the future wholly at st vincents abbey to which he readily consented if my offered retirement did not wholly obviate his suspicions it left him at least no pretense for tormenting me with them his character i ever found of a common stamp credulous and mutable yet selfwilled and passionate vain of the rights of his rank without merit to distinguish them he always conceived himself injured when another was preferred and the partiality of elizabeth toward his rival offended him almost as much as that i had so obviously expressed  the generous essex respected my peace and virtue so far that after another fruitless effort to persuade me to see him he consented to pursue the path i had traced out and satisfied of my fidelity swore sacredly to cherish the sentiments i had permitted him to retain it was needless to ask partial intelligence of a man who employed the voice of the kingdom i had fortunately distinguished one fame had adopted i therefore took a tender leave of lady pembroke and mingling my parting tears with a thousand unspoken blessings by an effort of virtue i admired in myself i boldly encountered my fate determined to use every effort to render it as supportable as might be  st vincents abbey again received me this mansion lord arlington had purchased at the time of his marriage less for any charms he perceived in it than the advantages of the country round which supplied him every variety of rural diversion here i at last began to breathe and forming my mind to that melancholy repose a decided destiny however deplorable allows i called to my aid the sustaining principles of religion and morality i turned my feeble feet toward every dwelling misfortune had passed over and raising both with gifts and soothing the sad wretches she had depressed reflected back into my own bosom the comforts i had bestowed i gathered into the abbey such of their children as were weakly and deformed and while those blessed with florid health pursued the track of labor the others were instructed in tapestry point reading writing and music according to their sex and age surrounded by these affecting objects who thus found in the liberality of art a counterbalance for the unkindness of nature i sometimes touched my lute with sensations so sublime that fancy dispersed every bodily imperfection in my little auditory and lighting up their cheeks with the softest tinge of the morning i seemed to see the human robes of wretchedness drop off and the light pinions of immortality wave toward heaven  striving by such and indeed every means in my power to shut out the fruitless wishes for lost happiness which still beat fervently at my heart i filled up with unceasing employments the long long year often did my feet wander toward the cell and the recess often in the wellknown windings of that wood where once we carolled together notes as careless and pleasant as those of the birds around us have i paused my sister and watered with embittered tears the precious memorials of days that never could return  conscious i could ill brook the least doubt or enquiry into my conduct i made it an invariable rule never to pass the gate unaccompanied yet lord arlington conceived an antipathy to this solitary asylum every day increased i did not compliment him with a total forbearance of the few amusements innocence and retirement allowed alas i learnt from his conduct that jealousy the most restless and insatiate of all our passions mingles in the habit even when driven out of the heart  had his love known the refinements common to that passion in a generous nature he would have felt that an unhappy attachment is nourished by solitude and home and that the person who once resolves to venture abroad shows a noble resolution to contend with it a thousand times he haunted my footsteps he broke in upon my loneliness you would have thought he had taken pleasure in beholding the tears and regrets he first occasioned  the dotage of the queen became every day more manifest and even the blow she in one of her wild transports gave essex more disgraced herself than him  his intrepid resentment  his uncourtly sincerity  his haughty retirement  every action of his life confirmed that admiration i still thought myself entitled to cherish the unbounded power he afterward possessed when reconciled showed the extravagance of her attachment and elizabeth cruel inexorable to me in every other instance crowned to her own disgrace in this the only wish she had permitted me to retain  after several ineffectual efforts to gain distinction at court lord arlington conceived himself injured and by retiring wholly into the country persecuted me the year round with his company but not having a taste for the sciences nor any of those resources a strong understanding involuntarily supplies even to the unfortunate he existed only while employed hawking hunting and fishing spun out the tedious years and a rustic company often closed the evening with intoxication that apathy my exhausted passions had now sunk into appeared to his undiscern  content and as his own love abated he fancied mine increased till he made a discovery his most needy parasite never seconded  that we were at length entirely happy  to confirm this surprising happiness which existed only in his own imagination and perhaps owed its creation to continual inebriation he resolved to exterminate those ruins where i had owned i passed my childhood and which he thought still kept alive embittered remembrances time would otherwise erase his steward suggested that the materials were wanted to erect a manufacture in the neighborhood and that the cutting down the surrounding woods now grown to valuable timber would more than answer to the expense incurred while new plantations would at once open the prospect on that side the abbey and deprive me of an inanimate object of affection of which lord arlington still entertained a jealousy as excessive as preposterous  this proposal met the strongest opposition from me on every account it was dreadful to think of annihilating every trace of my youth every object which could remind me i had ever been beloved or connected to disturb the sacred ashes of my early protectors and leave them exposed to the winds of heaven and the hands of the laborer  but it was yet more dreadful to me to risque the little peace i had been able to collect from the wreck of all my hopes  to wake wishes which were perhaps torpid only because vain  to tempt lord essex to break the promise i had wrung from him  in short to take the most remote chance of again beholding him  for to prevent the daily regret i might experience at being a spectator of this disagreeable metamorphosis in my favorite spot lord arlington was determined to take me for that time to london in vain i remonstrated the stronger my disgust appeared the less he imagined he had to dread nor among his whole round of suppositions once thought it possible i could fear myself painful experience now reminded me that the least hint on this subject would be ruin and every other reason rather strengthening his design i was compelled to yield to it  how readily with every passing mile recurred the dear habitual impressions my quickened pulses were again animated by my heart and i beheld even the palace without disgust because essex reigned there lady pembroke met me with an embrace neither time or absence had chilled she surveyed my amended looks with infinite satisfaction and flattered herself because i was no longer a spectre i was happy ah much erring friend the embers of that fatal fire tears had almost quenched again were gradually relighting  i felt almost disappointed at hearing essex was still on the seas that crowned with victory at cadiz his valor had only been surpassed by his conduct the sensation this news excited rendered me sensible of the precipice on which i stood and thanking heaven most devoutly for his absence i acknowledged in it my safety  the few friends fortune had left me welcomed my return with ardor and in their society my subdued spirits might have found some relief had i been permitted an unlimited share of it but lord arlington saw the world in a different point of view when mingling with it and at a distance the habit of being informed of every employment of mine he did not witness had now grown upon him so strongly that he laid an embargo on my time and suffered none of it to be passed out of his own house without he was of the party indignation was by nature the marking feature of my soul  alas what sufferings had it already entailed upon me  this glaring insult at once shocked my feelings and struck at my principles  those traits of bitterness and wildness i had strove to obliterated in solitude and silence again appeared in my character i became sullen and impenetrable  for my own sake i forbore violence and error but i no longer cared whether i was supposed to do so  perhaps lord arlington was not so culpable as he at first appeared for the hatred of the countess of essex inexorably pursued me  from the fatal moment when i fainted at court she believed herself licensed in her injurious surmises they had long known no bounds and expecting her lord home daily she by remote and artful insinuations poisoned the mind of mine to secure her from any danger should essex arrive  weak and misjudging woman  had she generously sympathized in the cruel events which robbed me of happiness to cast it away on her my melting heart would have spent its last breath in wishing that happiness perpetuated the purest mind alone attracts the venom of the world as the either the vapors of the earth but like that unless agitated to a storm soon recovers its clearness and insensibly returns in blessings the grossness it exhaled far from meditating any injury to the countess of essex i respected too much the peace of her husbands mind to recall to his remembrance a wretch born but to destroy it  nevertheless i did not think virtue herself would refuse me one little satisfaction i could not but desire a picture of the storming of cadiz had been drawn by a spanish painter taken there and sent by essex to lord pembroke among the many portraits it preserved his own was the most conspicuous and every one pronounced it the finest ever drawn it attracted the curiosity of all ranks of people and the gallery it was placed in was scarcely ever empty it was so much the topic of discourse that fashion must have excited a desire in me to see it had my heart been uninterested yet the unreasonable jealousy of lord arlington condemned me to silence nor dared i propose visiting lady pembroke at this crisis lest the desire should be construed into a proof of mental guilt my nature spurned at the constraint to which i found myself subjected and my amiable friend fearful i should suffer in my intellects more severely for the selfdenial than i possibly could for the indulgence planned a method by which she thought the illeffects of either guarded against  the queen gave an entertainment at greenwich on the marriage of one of her favorites to which she invited the whole court and a variety of masks and other entertainments were projected  lady pembroke could not dispense with appearing there nor could lord arlington convinced he must for once be safely absent she proposed calling in her barge ere she went to greenwich and conveying me to her house leaving me in the gallery with orders to her servants to attend me home whenever i pleased  in this project there was nothing dishonorable or unsafe and i embraced it readily lord arlington i knew was to be at greenwich in the morning as the bridegroom was his relation and i waited for the appointed moment with an impatience those only who live like me whole years upon a look can judge of  lady pembroke executed this design with as much facility as she had formed it and passing on to greenwich committed me to the care of her family who were told it was my intention to copy a beautiful drawing of their lady fixed up in the gallery how disdainful of mystery is a truly noble soul i stopped short on the threshold and could i without singularity have ventured immediately to return i had not entered the house it was silent and solitary all but the inferior domestics having followed either their lord or lady the servants who conducted me locked the door by which i entered to guard me from intruders to whom this picture had accustomed them  ah how lively was my emotion to behold the features indelibly impressed on my heart perpetuated with almost the same strength and truth in the act of wresting a sword the inflamed eye of him who held it showed had a moment before been pointed at the english generals bosom essex proudly looked down on the surrounding spaniards whose impassioned gestures supplicated for the life of him who had thus immediately attacked the conqueror  ah heaven cried i fearfully bursting into tears have i thus long dreamt of glory  honor  immortality  nor considered the dangers by which thou must acquire them  waste not those precious gems on senseless canvas said a voice to which my heart was born to vibrate  behold thy essex himself thy faithful essex as truly thine as when this soft hand first returned his ardent pressure  alas my sister what a vicissitude of powerful emotions took possession of my soul and set every feature at an event so unexpected fear and horror were however prevalent and seemed to check the sweetness of again beholding him for though my eyes surveyed his form my heart for the first time seemed to shut him out and fold itself up in utter darkness  you speak not my beloved added he oh satisfy my agonized heart and let me think you know me  know you ah essex faltered i redoubling my tears can aught but the grave obliterate those features from my memory  perhaps even that wants the power  but a thousand nameless miseries make me shrink from the moment  make my terrified soul shrink even from you  collect yourself my worshipped ellinor resumed he believe me i come not an artful black seducer  chance and chance only has crowned wishes so long submitted to your will it would not suffer those sacred sighs to become common air those lovely tears to fall upon the earth it sent me here to profit by indulgences you were willing to bestow on my shadow  if i withold them from yourself returned i endeavoring to collect my fluttered thoughts impute it not to my will but to the overruling fate which has torn us from each other  oh essex let us not venture once to look behind but consider only the present  the time the place the person would stamp me with ignominy if discovered and rob me of the only pride the only consolation fortune has left me  i have long ceased to live to the world and to myself but to my god and you i yet owe an exertion of the principles he gave and you called into action  i rose deeply disordered and attempted to draw away my hand but his firmer nerves obstinately retained the trembling prisoner and my heart yielding to his piercing solicitations for a few minutes i sat down once more with him by my side  good heavens while i relate this it appears a mere vision  did i really see essex  were my senses really revived by that voice so long forgotten except when fancy recalled it  ah i have had but too sad a conviction this has been however strange and impossible it appears   wrong me not with supposing i would entrap you my sweet love said he i am even now arrived in england nor did i foresee in yielding to pique in a secret return how great a happiness i should ensure to myself  disgusted with the injustice of the doting queen who has graced howard with the laurels won by me i resolved to call my friends secretly together and pembroke is just gone to collect them  at midnight all are to meet here and agree on the way most likely to punish her unfair decision by a happiness in my fortune unguessed by him and unforeseen by me we walked in this gallery while consulting and when left alone the fatigue of my journey made me throw myself on the couch in yon window and draw the curtain to indulge the drowsiness with which i was seized how sweetly was my slumber disturbed by her who has broken so many with sorrow dear was the surprise with which i saw her enter i saw the careful servant as if actuated by love enclose her and retire entranced with a pleasure which almost took from me the power of motion i beheld her lovely eyes fixed on my inanimate portrait i saw or rather i felt the tender expressions her unguarded soul uttered  what dreary ages have elapsed since my eyes have been thus permitted to fix themselves on hers  since in this dear hand i grasped the blessing that was to have given value as well as happiness to my future life  alas my lord resumed i recollect that those pleasant days those flattering hopes those dear wishes a higher power has annihilated  nor while the tie which robbed you of this trembling hand subsists can i suffer it to be thus pressed in yours yet recollect at the same moment the influence you still have over my heart  an influence virtue alone contests with you  ah gentle essex fix not an angry eye upon me  you know not the wound you give  the horrors you may occasion  the wild accent of my voice struck even my own ear and not daring to trust it with another syllable i strove to bury my agitation and sensibility in silence  alas nature was too highly wrought  a suffocation more painful than fainting ensued and agonized with surprise tenderness and fear essex would have called loudly for assistance i retained just sense enough to prevent him and throwing open a window he then sought to recover me by vows of implicit obedience my faculties were almost restored when a noise at the door made me wish them for ever annihilated no longer able to consider the just or proper i threw myself for shelter into those arms that gladly opened to receive me and buried my face in the satin cloak of essex the voice i dreaded rushed upon my ear and increasing my terror caused me to grasp my safeguard more closely  a danger too pressing for apologies obliged that generous lover to throw me from him  i opened my fearful eyes soon fixed by horror to behold the swords of lord essex and lord arlington pointed at each others bosoms why did not my frail and erring reason at this perilous moment forsake me alas i was never more sensible of agony and terror i thought the cry i sent forth must be mortal but perceiving it insufficient either to kill me or prevent the bloody conflict i started up and forcibly flung myself between their swords that of my husband pierced my shoulder while his more skilful adversary wounded and disarmed him inured to every kind of misery save this i beheld my streaming blood with a dismay unknown before and from the faintness it occasioned never doubted that i approached the period so often wished for and pronounced myself dying  then raising my eyes to the pale statue of essex who resting on the two swords hung in silent agony over me i adjured him to vindicate my fame and beseeching the almighty to receive my guiltless spirit and crown his future days with that honor and happiness i alone had interrupted i turned toward the erring wretch beside me with whose flowing blood mine mingled and having attested in broken accents my innocence deigned to request his forgiveness i had no longer however power even to receive it extreme weakness blended for once objects ever before so distinct and i ceased to feel for the lover or dread the husband  end of the second volume
