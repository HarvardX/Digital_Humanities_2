it is not only the life of louis xiv that we propose to write we have a greater object in view we mean to set before posterity not only the portrait of one mans actions but that of the spirit of mankind in general in the most enlightened of all ages every age has produced heroes and politicians all nations have experienced revolutions and all histories are nearly alike to those who seek only to furnish their memories with facts but whosoever thinks or what is still more rare whosoever has taste will find but four ages in the history of the world these four happy ages are those in which the arts were carried to perfection and which by serving as the era of the greatness of the human mind are examples for posterity the first of these ages to which true glory is annexed is that of philip and alexander or that of a pericles a demosthenes an aristotle a plato an apelles a phidias and a praxiteles and this honor has been confined within the limits of ancient greece the rest of the known world was then in a state of barbarism   the second age is that of cæsar and augustus distinguished by the names of lucretius cicero titus livius virgil horace ovid varro and vitruvius the third is that which followed the taking of constantinople by mahomet ii then a family of private citizens was seen to do that which the kings of europe should have undertaken the medici invited to florence the learned who had been driven out of greece by the turks this was the age of italys glory the polite arts had already recovered a new life in that country the italians honored them with the title of vertu as the first greeks had distinguished them by the name of wisdom everything tended toward perfection a michelangelo a raphael a titian a tasso and an ariosto flourished the art of engraving was invented elegant architecture appeared again as admirable as in the most triumphant ages of rome and the gothic barbarism which had disfigured europe in every kind of production was driven from italy to make way for good taste the arts always transplanted from greece to italy found themselves in a favorable soil where they instantly produced fruit france england germany and spain aimed in their turn to gather these fruits but either they could not live in those climates or else they degenerated very rapidly francis i encouraged learned men but such as were merely learned men he had architects but he   had no michelangelo nor palladio he endeavored in vain to establish schools for painting the italian masters whom he invited to france raised no pupils there some epigrams and a few loose tales made the whole of our poetry rabelais was the only prose writer in vogue in the time of henry ii in a word the italians were in possession of everything that was beautiful excepting music which was then in but a rude state and experimental philosophy which was everywhere equally unknown lastly the fourth age is that known by the name of the age of louis xiv and is perhaps that which approaches the nearest to perfection of all the four enriched by the discoveries of the three former ones it has done greater things in certain kinds than those three together all the arts indeed were not carried farther than under the medici augustus and alexander but human reason in general was more improved in this age we first became acquainted with sound philosophy it may truly be said that from the last years of cardinal richelieus administration till those which followed the death of louis xiv there has happened such a general revolution in our arts our genius our manners and even in our government as will serve as an immortal mark to the true glory of our country this happy influence has not been confined to france it has communicated itself to england where it has stirred up an emulation which that ingenious and deeply   learned nation stood in need of at that time it has introduced taste into germany and the sciences into russia it has even reanimated italy which was languishing and europe is indebted for its politeness and spirit of society to the court of louis xiv before this time the italians called all the people on this side of the alps by the name of barbarians it must be owned that the french in some degree deserved this reproachful epithet our forefathers joined the romantic gallantry of the moors with the gothic rudeness they had hardly any of the agreeable arts among them which is a proof that the useful arts were likewise neglected for when once the things of use are carried to perfection the transition is quickly made to the elegant and agreeable and it is not at all astonishing that painting sculpture poetry eloquence and philosophy should be in a manner unknown to a nation who though possessed of harbors on the western ocean and the mediterranean sea were without ships and who though fond of luxury to an excess were hardly provided with the most common manufactures the jews the genoese the venetians the portuguese the flemish the dutch and the english carried on in their turn the trade of france which was ignorant even of the first principles of commerce louis xiii on his accession to the crown had not a single ship the city of paris contained not quite four hundred thousand men and had not above four fine public edifices the other cities of the kingdom   resembled those pitiful villages which we see on the other side of the loire the nobility who were all stationed in the country in dungeons surrounded with deep ditches oppressed the peasants who cultivated the land the high roads were almost impassable the towns were destitute of police and the government had hardly ever any credit among foreign nations we must acknowledge that ever since the decline of the carlovingian family france had languished more or less in this infirm state merely for want of the benefit of a good administration for a state to be powerful the people must either enjoy a liberty founded upon laws or the royal authority must be fixed beyond all opposition in france the people were slaves till the reign of philip augustus the noblemen were tyrants till louis xi and the kings always employed in maintaining their authority against their vassals had neither leisure to think about the happiness of their subjects nor the power of making them happy louis xi did a great deal for the regal power but nothing for the happiness or the glory of the nation francis i gave birth to trade navigation and all the arts but he was too unfortunate to make them take root in the nation during his time so that they all perished with him henry the great was on the point of raising france from the calamities and barbarisms in which she had been plunged by thirty years of discord when he was assassinated in  0 his capital in the midst of a people whom he had begun to make happy the cardinal de richelieu busied in humbling the house of austria the calvinists and the grandees did not enjoy a power sufficiently undisturbed to reform the nation but he had at least the honor of beginning this happy work thus for the space of nine hundred years our genius has been almost always restrained under a gothic government in the midst of divisions and civil wars destitute of any laws or fixed customs changing every second century a language which still continued rude and unformed the nobles were without discipline and strangers to everything but war and idleness the clergy lived in disorder and ignorance and the common people without industry and stupefied in their wretchedness the french had no share either in the great discoveries or admirable inventions of other nations they have no title to the discoveries of painting gunpowder glasses the telescope the sector compass the airpump or the true system of the universe they were making tournaments while the portuguese and spaniards were discovering and conquering new countries from the east to the west of the known world charles v had already scattered the treasures of mexico over europe before the subjects of francis i had discovered the uncultivated country of canada but by the little which the french did in the beginning of the sixteenth century we may see what they are capable of when properly conducted    i propose in this place to show what they have been under louis xiv and it is to be wished that the posterity of this monarch and that of his subjects equally animated with a happy emulation may use their endeavors to surpass their ancestors it must not be expected to meet here with a minute detail of the wars carried on in this age this would be an endless task we are obliged to leave to the compilers of annals the care of collecting with exactness all these small facts which would only serve to divert the attention from the principal object it is their province to point out the marches and countermarches of armies and the particular days on which the trenches were opened before towns which were taken and retaken again by force of arms or ceded and restored by treaties a thousand circumstances which are interesting to those who live at the time are lost to the eyes of posterity and disappear to make room for the great events which have determined the fate of empires every transaction is not worthy of being committed to writing in this history we shall confine ourselves only to what is deserving of the attention of all ages what paints the genius and manners of mankind contributes to instruction and prompts to the love of virtue of the arts and of our country we have already seen what france and the other kingdoms of europe were before the birth of louis xiv we shall now describe the great political and military events of his reign the interior government    of the kingdom as being an object of more importance to the people shall be treated of by itself the private life of louis xiv and the particular anecdotes of his court and reign shall hold a principal place in this account there shall be other articles for the arts and sciences and for the progress of the human mind in this age lastly we shall speak of the church which has been so long connected with the government has sometimes disturbed its peace and at others been its defence and which though instituted for the inculcating of morality too frequently gives itself up to politics and the impulse of the human passions    chapter i the states of europe before louis xiv for a long time past the christian part of europe—russia excepted—might be considered as a great republic divided into several states some of which were monarchial others mixed some aristocratic and others popular but all corresponding with one another all having the same basis of religion though divided into several sects and acknowledging the same principles of public and political equity which were unknown to the other parts of the world it is from these principles that the european nations do not make slaves of their prisoners that they respect the persons of their enemies ambassadors that they agree together concerning the preeminence and some other rights belonging to certain princes such as the emperor kings and other lesser potentates and particularly in the prudent policy of preserving as far as they are able an equal balance of power among themselves by continually carrying on negotiations even in the midst of war and keeping ambassadors    or less honorable spies at one anothers courts to give notice to the rest of the designs of any single one to sound the alarm at once over all europe and to prevent the weaker side from being invaded by the stronger which is always ready to attempt it after the death of charles v the balance of power inclined too much on the side of the house of austria this powerful house was in the year    0 possessor of spain portugal and the riches of america the netherlands the duchy of milan the kingdoms of naples bohemia hungary and even germany—if we may say so—were a part of its patrimony and had all these states been united under one single head of this house it is reasonable to believe that he would at length have become master of all europe germany the empire of germany is the most powerful neighbor which france has it is nearly of the same extent there is not perhaps so much money in it but it abounds more with sturdy men inured to labor the germanic nation is governed with but little difference as france was under the first kings of the capetian race who were chiefs of several great vassals by whom they were frequently ill obeyed and of a great number of lesser ones there are sixty free cities called imperial about as many secular princes nearly forty ecclesiastical ones as well abbots as bishops nine electors among whom    we may reckon four kings and lastly the emperor who is head of all these potentates these at present compose this great germanic body which by the phlegmatic disposition of its members is maintained in as much order and regularity as there was formerly confusion in the french government each member of the empire has his particular rights privileges and obligations and the knowledge of such a number of laws which are frequently disputed makes what is called in germany the study of the public law for which that nation is so famous the emperor should not in fact be much more powerful or rich than a doge of venice germany being divided into cities and principalities nothing is left for the chief of such a number of states but the preeminence accompanied with the supreme honors without either demesnes or money and consequently without power he does not possess a single village in virtue of his title of emperor nevertheless this dignity often as vain as supreme has become so powerful in the hands of the austrians that it has frequently been feared that they would convert this republic of princes into an absolute monarchy the christian part of europe especially germany was then and still is divided into two parties or sects the first is that of the catholics who are all more or less subject to the authority of the pope the other is that of the enemies to the spiritual and    temporal power of the pontiff and the prelates of the church of rome these latter are called by the general name of protestants though divided into lutherans calvinists and other sects who all hate one another as much as they do the church of rome in germany the states of saxony brandenburg the palatinate a part of bohemia and hungary the houses of brunswick and würtemberg followed the lutheran religion which is by them called the evangelical all the free cities of the empire have likewise embraced this sect as seemingly more agreeable to a people jealous of their liberty than the religion of the church of rome the calvinists who are scattered among the lutherans form but an inconsiderable party the roman catholics constitute the rest of the empire and having at their head the house of austria they are without doubt the most powerful not only germany but all the christian states were still bleeding with the wounds of the many religious wars in which they had been engaged a madness peculiar to christians and unknown to idolaters and which was the fatal consequence of that dogmatic turn which had for so long a time been introduced among all ranks of people almost every point of controversy occasioned a civil war and foreign nations—nay perhaps our own posterity—will one day be at a loss to comprehend how their ancestors could have thus butchered one    another while they were preaching the doctrine of patience i have already shown how near ferdinand ii was to changing the german aristocracy into an absolute monarchy and how he was on the point of being dethroned by gustavus vasa his son ferdinand iii who inherited his politics and like him made war from his cabinet swayed the imperial sceptre during the minority of louis xiv germany was not then so flourishing as it has since become not only was every kind of luxury wholly unknown there but even the conveniences of life were very scarce in the houses of the greatest noblemen till the year      when they were introduced by the french refugees who retired thither and set up their manufactories this fruitful and wellpeopled country was destitute of trade and money the gravity of manners and the slowness peculiar to the germans deprived them of those pleasures and agreeable arts which the more penetrating italians had cultivated for many years and which the french industry began now to carry to perfection the germans though rich at home were poor everywhere else and this poverty added to the difficulty of uniting in a short time so many different peoples under one standard made it then nearly as at this day impossible for them to carry the war into their neighbors dominions or support it there for any time accordingly we almost always find the french carrying on a war against the empire    within the empire the difference of government and genius makes the french more proper for attacking and the germans for acting on the defensive spain the spanish nation governed by the elder branch of the house of austria after the death of charles v made itself more formidable to europe than the germanic empire the kings of spain were infinitely more absolute and rich than the emperors and the mines of mexico and peru furnished them with treasures sufficient to purchase the liberties of europe you have already seen the project of universal monarchy or rather universal superiority on the christian continent begun by charles v and carried on by philip ii the spanish greatness under philip ii became a vast body without substance which had more reputation than real strength philip iv who inherited his fathers weakness lost portugal by his neglect roussillon by the inferiority of his arms and catalonia by the abuse of his absolute authority such princes could not long continue successful in their wars against france if our errors and divisions gave them some few advantages they soon lost the fruits of them by their own want of capacity besides they had a people to command whose privileges gave them a right to serve ill the castilians for instance    had a privilege by which they were exempted from serving out of their own country the aragonese were continually opposing their liberties to the orders of the kings council and the catalans who looked upon their kings as their enemies would not even suffer them to raise militia in their provinces notwithstanding all these disadvantages spain by being united to the empire threw a very formidable weight into the balance of europe portugal at this time portugal was again made a kingdom john duke of braganza who passed for a weak prince had wrested this province from a king who was weaker than himself the portuguese through necessity cultivated trade which the spaniards through pride neglected and had in      entered into a league with the french and dutch against spain france gained more by the revolution in portugal than she could have done by the most signal victories the french ministry without having in the least contributed to this event reaped without any trouble the greatest advantage that can be wished for over an enemy that of seeing him attacked by an irreconcilable power portugal which thus threw off the spanish yoke extended its trade and augmented its power puts us in mind of holland which enjoyed the same advantages though in a very different manner  0 the united provinces this small state composed of seven united provinces a country abounding in excellent pasturage but destitute of all kinds of grain unhealthy and in a manner buried in the sea was for about half a century almost the only example in the world of what may be done by the love of liberty and unwearied labor these poor people few in number and inferior in military discipline to the meanest of the spanish militia and of no account in the rest of europe made head against the whole collected force of their master and tyrant philip ii eluded the designs of several princes who offered to assist them in hopes of enslaving them and founded a power which we have seen counterbalancing that of spain itself the desperation which tyranny inspires first armed these people liberty raised their courage and the princes of the house of orange made them excellent soldiers no sooner did they become conquerors of their masters than they established a form of government which preserves as far as possible equality the most natural right of mankind this state was soon from its first foundation intimately attached to france they were united by interest and had the same enemies henry the great and louis xiii had been its allies and protectors    england england a far more powerful state arrogated to itself the sovereignty of the seas and pretended to preserve a balance between the powers of europe but charles i who began his reign in      was so far from being able to support the weight of this balance that he found the sceptre already falling through his hands he had attempted to render his power independent of the laws of england and to make a change in the religion of scotland he was too headstrong to be diverted from his projects and too weak to carry them into execution he was a good husband a good master a good father and an honest man but an illadvised prince he engaged in a civil war which lost him his throne and made him end his life on a scaffold by an unparalleled revolution this civil war which was begun in the minority of louis xiv prevented england for some time from taking part in her neighbors concerns she lost her credit in europe with her quiet at home her trade was obstructed and other nations looked upon her as buried beneath her own ruins till the time that she at once became more formidable than ever under the rule of cromwell who had enslaved her with the gospel in one hand the sword in the other and the mask of religion on his face and who in his administration concealed under the qualities of a great king all the crimes of a usurper    rome the balance which england had so long flattered herself with the hope of keeping up by her superior power rome endeavored to maintain by her politics italy was divided as she now is into several sovereignties that which is possessed by the pope is sufficiently great to render him respectable as a prince and too small to make him formidable the nature of the government does not contribute to the peopling of his country which also has very little trade or money his spiritual authority which is always mixed with something of the temporal is slighted and abhorred by onehalf of christendom and though he is considered as a father by the other half yet he has some children who resist his will at times with reason and success it is the maxim of the french government to look upon him as a sacred and enterprising person whose hands must sometimes be tied though they kiss his feet we still see in all the catholic countries the traces of those steps which the court of rome has frequently made toward universal monarchy all the princes of the romish religion upon their accession send an embassy to the pope which is termed the embassy of obedience every crowned head has a cardinal at his court who takes the name of protector the pope grants bulls for filling up all vacant bishoprics and expresses himself in these bulls as if he conferred these dignities by his own    pure authority all the italian spanish flemish and even some of the french bishops style themselves bishops by divine permission and that of the holy see there is no kingdom in which the pope has not several benefices in his nomination and he receives as a tribute the first years revenue of consistorial benefices the religious orders whose principals reside at rome are again so many immediate subjects to the pontiff scattered over all states custom which does everything and which occasions the world to be governed by abuses as by laws has not always permitted princes to put an entire stop to this danger which in other respects is connected with things useful and sacred to swear allegiance to any other than the sovereign is a crime of high treason in a layman but in a convent it is a religious act the difficulty of knowing how far we are to carry our obedience to this foreign sovereign the ease with which we suffer ourselves to be seduced the pleasure there is in throwing off a natural yoke for a voluntary one the spirit of discord and the unhappiness of the times have but too often prevailed on whole bodies of religious orders to serve the cause of rome against their own country the enlightened spirit which has reigned in france for this past century and which has communicated itself to people of all ranks has proved the most effectual remedy against this abuse the excellent books which have been written on this subject    have done real service both to kings and people and one of the great changes which was wrought by this means in our manners under the reign of louis xiv is that the religious of all kinds begin now to be persuaded that they should be subject to their king before they are servants to the pope the juridical power which is the essential mark of sovereignty still remains with the roman pontiff and even the french government notwithstanding all the liberties of the gallican church allows a final appeal to the pope in all ecclesiastical causes if anyone is desirous of obtaining a divorce of marrying a near relation or of being released from his vows application is to be made to the court of rome and not to the bishop of the diocese there all indulgences are rated and the individuals of all states may there purchase dispensations at all prices these advantages which are by many people looked upon as the consequences of the greatest abuse and by others as the remains of the most sacred rights are always artfully preserved and modern rome employs as much policy in keeping up its credit as the ancient republic did in conquering onehalf of the known world no court ever knew better how to act agreeably to men and times the popes are almost always italians grown gray in public affairs and divested of those passions which make men blind to their interest their council is composed of cardinals who resemble them and who are all animated with    the same spirit this council issues mandates which reach as far as china and the extremes of america in which sense it may be said to take in the whole universe and we may say of it as a stranger formerly said of the roman senate i have beheld an assembly of kings most of our writers have with reason inveighed against the ambition of this court but i do not find one who has done sufficient justice to its prudence neither do i know if any other nation could have so long maintained itself in the possession of so many privileges continually contested any other court might probably have lost them either by its haughtiness its effeminacy its sloth or its vivacity but that of rome by an almost constant proper use of resolution and concession has preserved all that was humanly possible for her to preserve we have seen her submissive to charles v terrible to our king henry iii by turns the friend and foe of henry iv acting cunningly with louis xiii openly opposing louis xiv at a time when he was to be feared and frequently a private enemy to the emperors of whom she was more distrustful than even of the turkish sultan some rights many pretensions patience and politics are all that rome has left now of that ancient power which six centuries ago attempted to subject the empire and all europe to the triple crown naples is still an existing proof of that right which the popes formerly assumed with so much art    and parade of creating and bestowing kingdoms but the king of spain who is the present possessor of that kingdom has only left the court of rome the dangerous honor of having an overpowerful vassal the rest of italy as for the rest the popes dominions were situated in a peaceable country which had never been disturbed but by a trifling war of which i have already spoken between the cardinals barberini nephews to urban viii and the duke of parma the other provinces of italy were biassed by various interests venice had the turks and the emperor to fear and could hardly defend its dominions on the continent against the pretensions of germany and the invasion of the grand seignior it was no longer that city which was formerly the mistress of the trade of the whole world and which one hundred and fifty years before had excited the jealousy of so many crowned heads the wisdom of its administration continued the same as formerly but the destruction of its great trade deprived it of almost all its strength and the city of venice was by its situation incapable of being conquered and by its weakness incapable of making conquests the state of florence enjoyed tranquillity and abundance under the government of the medici and literature arts and politeness which they had first introduced still flourished there tuscany was then to italy what athens had been to greece    savoy after having been rent by a civil war and desolated by the french and spanish armies was at length wholly united in favor of france and contributed to weaken the austrian power in italy the swiss nation preserved as at this day its own liberty without seeking to oppress its neighbors they sold the service of their troops to nations richer than themselves they were poor and ignorant of the sciences and of all the arts which are begotten by luxury but they were wise and they were happy the northern kingdoms the northern nations of europe viz poland sweden denmark and russia were like the other powers always distrustful of and at war with one another in poland both the manners and government were as they now are nearly the same as those of the ancient goths and franks the crown was elective the nobles had a share in the supreme authority the people were slaves the infantry was weak and the cavalry was wholly composed of nobles there were no fortified towns and scarcely any trade these people were attacked at one time by the swedes or the muscovites and at others by the turks the swedes who were a freer nation by their constitution which admits even the lowest class of the people into the assembly of the general estates but who were at that time more subject to their    kings than the poles were almost everywhere victorious denmark which had formerly been so formidable to sweden was no longer so to any power and muscovy had not yet emerged from barbarism the turks the turks were not what they had been under their selims their mahomets and their solymans the seraglio though corrupted by effeminacy still retained its cruelty the sultans were at the same time the most despotic of sovereigns and the least secure of their throne and life osman and ibrahim had lately been strangled and mustapha had been twice deposed the ottoman empire tottering from these repeated shocks was also attacked by the persians but when it had enjoyed a little respite from them and the revolutions of the seraglio were at an end this empire became again formidable to christendom and spread its conquests from the mouth of the boristhenes to the adriatic sea muscovy hungary greece and the archipelago fell alternately a prey to the turkish arms and from the year      they had constantly carried on the war of candia which proved so fatal to the christians such then were the situation strength and interests of the principal european nations about the time that louis xiii of france departed this life    the situation of france france who was in alliance with sweden holland savoy and portugal and had the favorable wishes of the other nations who remained inactive was engaged in a war against the empire and spain which proved ruinous to both sides and particularly fatal to the house of austria this war was like all those which have been carried on for so many centuries between christian princes in which millions of men have been sacrificed and whole provinces laid waste to obtain a few frontier towns the possession of which is seldom worth the expense of conquering them the generals of louis xiii had taken roussillon and the catalans had given their province to france as the protectress of that liberty which they defended against their kings but all these successes had not prevented the enemy from making themselves masters of corbie in the year      and advancing as far as pontoise fear had driven onehalf of the inhabitants out of paris and cardinal de richelieu in the midst of his mighty projects for humbling the austrian power had been reduced to lay a tax upon the houses with great gates in the city of paris every one of which was obliged to furnish a footman armed to drive the enemy from the gates of the metropolis the french there had done the spaniards and germans a great deal of mischief and had suffered as much themselves  0 the manners of the age the wars had produced several illustrious generals such as a gustavus adolphus a wallenstein a duke of saxeweimar a piccolomini a john de werth the marshal de guébriant the princes of orange and the count dharcourt nor was this age less famous for ministers of state chancellor oxenstiern the famous duke olivarez and especially the cardinal duke de richelieu had drawn the attention of all europe upon them there never was an age which had not some famous statesmen and soldiers politics and arms seem unhappily to be the two professions most natural to man who must always be either negotiating or fighting the most fortunate is accounted the greatest and the public frequently attributes to merit what is only the effect of a happy success war was then carried on differently from what it afterward was in the time of louis xiv there were not such numerous armies since the siege of metz by charles v no general had been at the head of fifty thousand men they did not make use of so many cannon in besieging and defending places as at present the art of fortification itself was then in its infancy spears and short guns were then in use as well as the sword which is now entirely laid aside one of the old laws of nations was still in force namely that of declaring war by a herald louis xiii was the last who observed    this custom he sent a herald at arms to brussels to declare war against spain in the year      nothing was more common at that time than to see armies commanded by priests the cardinal infante the cardinals of savoy richelieu and la valette and sourdis archbishop of bordeaux had put on the cuirass and waged war in person a bishop of mendes had been frequently intendant of the army the popes sometimes threatened these military prelates with excommunication pope urban iii being incensed against france sent word to cardinal la valette that he would strip him of the purple if he did not lay down the sword but when the pontiff came afterward to be reconciled to france he loaded him with benedictions ambassadors who are equally the ministers of peace with churchmen made no difficulty of serving in the armies of the allied powers to whom they were sent charnacé who was envoy from the court of france to holland commanded a regiment there in      and some time afterward even the ambassador destrades was a colonel in the dutch service france had not in all more than eighty thousand effective men on foot its marine which had for some centuries fallen to decay and had afterward been a little restored by cardinal de richelieu was ruined under mazarin louis xiii had not more than fortyfive millions of real ordinary revenue but money was then at twentysix livres the mark    consequently these fortyfive millions amounted to nearly eightyfive millions of the present currency when the arbitrary value of the silver mark is carried to fortynine and a half livres—an exorbitant numerical value which justice and the interest of the public forbid ever to be increased trade which is so universal at present was then in a very few hands the police of the kingdom was entirely neglected a certain sign of a bad administration cardinal de richelieu wholly taken up with his own greatness which was linked with that of the state had begun to render france formidable outside its borders but had not been able to make it flourishing within the roads were neither kept in repair nor properly guarded they were infested by troops of robbers the streets of paris which were narrow badly paved and covered with disagreeable filth swarmed with thieves it is proved by the registers of parliament that the city watch was at that time reduced to fortyfive men badly paid and who frequently did no duty at all ever since the death of francis i france had been continually rent by civil wars or disturbed by factions the people never wore the yoke in a voluntary or peaceable manner the nobles were trained up from their youth in conspiracies it was the court art the same as that of pleasing the sovereign has since been this spirit of discord and faction spread itself from the court into the smallest towns and took possession    of all public societies in the kingdom everything was disputed because there was no general rule the very parishes in paris used to come to blows with one another and processions have fought together about the honor of their banners the canons of notre dame were frequently seen engaged with those of the holy chapel the parliament and the chamber of accounts battled for the upper hand in the church of notre dame the very day that louis xiii put his kingdom under the protection of the virgin mary almost all the public corporations of the kingdom were in arms and almost every individual was inflamed with the fury of duelling this gothic barbarism which was formerly authorized by kings themselves and had become the distinguishing character of the nation contributed as much as the foreign and domestic wars to depopulate the country it is not saying too much to aver that in the course of twenty years of which ten had been troubled by war more french gentlemen died by the hands of frenchmen than by those of the enemy we shall not take any notice of the manner in which the arts and sciences were cultivated this part of the history of our manners will be found in its proper place we shall only remark that the french nation was plunged in ignorance without excepting even those who look upon themselves as removed above the common people astrologers were much consulted and greatly    confided in all the memoirs of this age to begin with the history of the president de thou are full of predictions even the grave and rigid duke of sully himself very seriously relates those which were made to henry iv this credulity which is the most infallible mark of ignorance prevailed so much at that time that care was taken to keep an astrologer concealed in queen anne of austrias chamber while she was in labor of louis the xiv it is hardly credible though we find it related by the abbot vittorio siri a contemporary writer of great authority that louis xiii had the surname of just given him from his childhood because he was born under the sign libra or the balance the same weakness that first brought this absurd chimera of judicial astrology into vogue occasioned a belief in fascinations and witchcrafts it was even made a point of religion and nothing was to be seen but priests driving out devils from those who were said to be possessed the courts of justice composed of magistrates who should have had more understanding than the vulgar were employed in trying witches and sorcerers the death of the famous curate of loudun urbain grandier will ever be a stain on the memory of cardinal de richelieu this man was condemned to the stake as a magician by commissioners appointed by the council of state we cannot without indignation reflect that the minister and the judges should have been so weak as to believe in the devils of loudun and so barbarous    as to condemn an innocent man to the flames and it will be remembered with astonishment by posterity that the wife of marshal dancre was burnt in the place de la grève for a witch there is still to be seen in a copy of some registers of the châtelet a trial which was begun in the year   0  on account of a horse which his master had with great pains taught to perform tricks as we now see some every day at our fairs they wanted to burn both master and horse we have already said enough to give an idea of the manners and spirit of the age which preceded that of louis xiv this want of understanding in all orders of the state did not a little to encourage even among the best people certain superstitious practices which were a disgrace to religion the protestants confounding the reasonable worship of the catholics with the abuses introduced into that worship were more firmly fixed in their hatred to our church to our popular superstitions frequently intermingled with debaucheries they opposed a brutal sternness and a ferocity of manners the character of almost all reformers thus was france rent and debased by a party spirit while that social disposition for which the nation is now so deservedly famous and esteemed was unknown among us there were then no houses where men of merit might meet in order to communicate their ideas to one another no academies no theatres in a word our manners    laws arts society religion peace and war had no resemblance to what was afterward seen in that age known by the name of the age of louis xiv chapter ii minority of louis xiv—the victories of the french under the great conde then duke of enghien cardinal de richelieu and louis xiii were lately dead the one admired and hated the other already forgotten they had left the french who were at that time a restless people in a fixed aversion to the very name of a ministry and with very little respect for the throne louis xiii had by his will settled a council of regency this monarch so ill obeyed when he was living flattered himself with meeting with more observance after his death but the first step taken by his widow anne of austria was to procure an arret of the parliament of paris for setting aside her husbands will this body which had been so long in opposition to the court and which under louis had with difficulty preserved its right of making remonstrances now annulled its monarchs will with the same ease as it would have determined the cause of a private citizen anne of austria applied to this assembly to have the regency unlimited because mary de medici had made use of the same court after the death of henry iv and mary de medici had set    this example because any other method would have been tedious and uncertain because the parliament being surrounded by her guards could not dispute her will and that an arret issued by the parliament and the peers seemed to confer an incontestable right the custom which always confers the regency on the kings mother appeared to the french at that time as fundamental a law as that by which women are excluded from the crown the parliament of paris having twice settled this point that is to say having by its own authority decreed the regency vested in the queenmothers seemed in fact to have conferred the regency it considered itself not without some show of reason as the guardian of our kings and every counsellor thought he had a part in the sovereign authority by the same arret gaston duke of orleans brother of the late king had the vain title given him of lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom under the queenregent who was absolute anne of austria was upon her first assuming the reins of government obliged to continue the war against her brother philip iv king of spain whom she affectionately loved it is difficult to assign any positive reason for the french having undertaken this war they claimed nothing from spain not even navarre which should have been the patrimony of the kings of france they had continued at war ever since the year      because    cardinal de richelieu would have it so and it is to be supposed that he was desirous of it in order to make himself necessary he had engaged in a league against the emperor with the swedes and duke bernhard of saxeweimar one of those generals whom the italians called condottieri who sold the service of their troops he also attacked the austrian spanish branch in those ten provinces which we now call by the general name of flanders and he had divided this country with the dutch at that time our allies though it was not yet conquered the stress of the war lay on the side of flanders the spanish troops marched from the frontiers of hainault to the number of twentysix thousand men under the command of an old experienced general whose name was don francisco de mello fell upon and ravaged the borders of champagne and attacked rocroi and thought soon to advance to the very gates of paris as they had done eight years before the death of louis xiii and the weakness of a minority raised their hopes and when they saw only an inconsiderable army opposed to them and that commanded by a young man of only twentyone years of age these hopes were changed into full security this inexperienced young man whom they so much despised was louis of bourbon then duke of enghien known since by the name of the great condé most great generals have become so by degrees but this prince was born a general the    art of war seemed in him a natural instinct there were only he and the swede torstenson who at twenty years of age were possessed of this talent which can dispense with experience the duke of enghien had received together with the news of louis xiiis death orders not to risk a battle marshal de lhôpital who had been given him as counsellor and guide backed these timid orders by his own caution but the prince heeded neither the court nor the marshal he intrusted his design to no one but fieldmarshal gassion a person worthy of being consulted by him they together obliged the marshal to give his assent to the battle it is observed of the prince that having made all the necessary dispositions the evening before the battle he slept so soundly that night that the people were obliged to wake him to begin the engagement the same thing is related of alexander it is very natural for a young man exhausted with the fatigue which must attend the preparations for such a day to fall into a sound sleep it is likewise as natural that a genius formed for war and acting without confusion should leave the body sufficiently calm for sleep the prince gained the battle himself by a quickness of sight which at once made him discern the danger and the means of preventing it and by a cool activity which carried him to every place at the time his presence was wanted in person at the head of the cavalry  0 he fell upon the spanish infantry till then deemed invincible which were as strong and compact as the ancient phalanx so greatly esteemed and could open much more quickly than the phalanx could in order to give room for the discharge of eighteen pieces of cannon which were placed in its centre the prince surrounded this body and charged it three times successively at length he broke it and no sooner was he assured of the victory than he gave orders to put a stop to the slaughter the spanish officers threw themselves at his feet for protection against the fury of the victorious soldiery the duke of enghien was as assiduous in securing them as he had been in conquering them the old count de fuentes who commanded this body of foot was slain on the field of battle on hearing which condé said he should have wished to die like him if he had not conquered the high esteem in which the spanish arms had till then been held by all europe was now lost and those of the french began to gain repute they had not for a century past gained so great a victory for the bloody day of melegnano which was rather disputed than gained by francis i over the swiss was as much owing to the black bands of germany as to the french the battles of pavia and st quentin were again two fatal eras to the reputation of france henry iv had the misfortune to gain great advantages only over his own nation in the reign of louis    xiii marshal de guébriant had had some inconsiderable successes but they were always counterbalanced by losses gustavus adolphus was the only one at that time who fought those great battles which shake a state and remain forever in the memory of posterity the battle of rocroi became the era of the french glory and of the great condés this general knew how to conquer and to make the most of conquest the letters he wrote made the court resolve on the siege of thionville which cardinal richelieu had not dared to hazard and when his couriers returned they found everything ready for the expedition the prince of condé marched through the enemys country eluded the vigilance of general beck and at length took thionville from there he hastened and laid siege to cirq which he also reduced he obliged the germans to repass the rhine followed them over that river and came upon the frontiers where he repaired all the defeats and losses which the french had sustained after the death of their commander de guébriant he found the town of freiburg in the enemys possession and general mercy under its walls with an army superior to his own condé had under him two marshals of france gramont and turenne the latter of whom had been made marshal about a month before in consideration of the services he had rendered against the spaniards at piedmont where he laid the foundation of that great reputation which he afterward    acquired the prince with these two generals attacked mercys camp august         which was intrenched upon two eminences the fight was renewed three times on three successive days it is said that the duke of enghien threw his commanders staff into the enemys trenches and marched to retake it sword in hand at the head of the regiment of conti there may sometimes be a necessity for such bold actions in leading on troops to attacks of so dangerous a nature this battle of freiburg rather bloody than decisive was the second victory the prince had gained mercy decamped four days afterward and the surrender of philippsburg and mentz were at once the proofs and fruits of this victory the duke of enghien then returned to paris where he was received amidst the acclamations of the people and demanded of the court the rewards due to his services he left the command of his army to marshal turenne but this general notwithstanding his great military skill was defeated at marienthal in april      upon this the prince hastens back to his army resumes the command and to the glory of commanding the great turenne added that of repairing his defeat he attacked mercy in the plains of nördlingen august        and gained a complete victory marshal gramont was taken and general glen the second in command to mercy was also made prisoner while mercy himself was among the number of the slain this    general who was esteemed one of the greatest captains of his age was interred on the field of battle with this inscription on his tomb sta viator heroem calcas—stop traveller thou treadest on a hero the name of the duke of enghien now eclipsed all others he afterward laid siege to dunkirk october        in sight of the spanish army and was the first who added that place to the french territories these many successes and services which were looked upon with a suspicious eye by the court rather than properly rewarded made him as much feared by the ministry as by his enemies he was therefore recalled from his theatre of conquest and glory and sent into catalonia with a handful of bad troops as badly paid then he besieged the town of lérida but was obliged to quit the siege he is accused by several writers of a foolish bravado in having opened the trenches to the sound of musical instruments they do not know that this was the custom in spain it was not long however before the ticklish situation of affairs obliged the court to recall him to flanders archduke leopold the emperors brother was then besieging the town of lens in artois condé as soon as he was restored to those troops who had always conquered under his command led them directly against the archduke leopold this was the third time he had given battle    with the advantage of numbers against him he addressed his soldiers in this short speech my friends remember rocroi freiburg and nördlingen this battle of lens put the finishing touch to his reputation in person he succored marshal gramont who was giving way with the left wing and took general beck prisoner the archduke with great difficulty saved himself with the count of fruensaldagna the enemys army which was composed of the imperialists and spaniards was totally routed august  0      they lost upward of a hundred stands of colors and thirtyeight pieces of cannon which at that time was a considerable number there were five thousand men taken prisoners and three thousand slain the rest deserted and the archduke was left without an army while the prince of condé was thus numbering the years of his youth by victories and while the duke of orleans brother of louis xiii maintained the reputation of a son of henry iv and that of his country by the taking of gravelines courtray and mardyke the viscount of turenne reduced landau drove the spaniards out of trier and restored the elector he gained the battles of lavingen and sommerhausen with the swedes and obliged the duke of bavaria to fly out of his dominions when almost eighty years old the count dharcourt took balaguier and beat the spaniards they lost portolongone    in italy and their fleet was defeated on that coast by twenty ships of war and as many galleys which was the whole of the french navy then newly restored by cardinal de richelieu this was not all the french army took lorraine from duke charles iv a warlike but fickle imprudent and unfortunate prince who at the same time saw his dominions seized on by the french and himself a prisoner of the spaniards the austrian power was hard pressed by the allies of france in the north and the south the duke of albuquerque the portuguese general gained the battle of badajoz against the spaniards torstenson defeated the imperialists near tabor and gained a complete victory and the prince of orange at the head of his hollanders penetrated as far as the province of brabant in flanders the spanish king was beaten on all sides and saw roussillon and catalonia in the hands of the french naples had lately revolted against him and thrown itself into the hands of the duke de guise the last prince of that branch of a house which had teemed with so many illustrious and dangerous men this prince who was deemed only a rash and bold adventurer because he did not succeed had however the glory of passing alone in a boat through the midst of the spanish fleet landing in naples and defending it without any other assistance than his own valor at the view of so many misfortunes pouring upon    the house of austria and such a train of victories gained by the french and seconded by the successes of their allies one would imagine that vienna and madrid only waited the moment when they should be obliged to throw open their gates and that the emperor and the king of spain must shortly be almost destitute of dominions nevertheless five years of excessive good fortune hardly chequered by one disappointment produced but very few real advantages cost an infinite deal of blood and brought about no change or if there was one to be apprehended it was rather on the side of france which was bordering upon its ruin in the midst of so many apparent successes chapter iii the civil war queen anne of austria the absolute regent had made cardinal mazarin master of the kingdom and of herself he had that power over her which every artful man must have over a woman weak enough to be governed and resolute enough to persist in the choice she has made of a favorite we read in some of the memoirs of those times that the queen made choice of mazarin for her confidant only because of the inability of potier bishop of beauvais whom she had at first chosen for her minister and who is represented as a man of no mean capacity this might possibly have been the    case and the queen might have made use of this man for some time as a cipher not to exasperate the nation by the choice of another cardinal and he a foreigner but we can never believe that potier began his short administration by declaring to the dutch that they must become catholics if they were desirous of continuing in alliance with france he might as well have made the same proposal to the swedes we find this piece of absurdity related by almost all our historians because they have read it in the memoirs of some of the courtiers and those concerned in the civil war there are however but too many passages in these memoirs either falsified by prejudice or related on the authority of popular rumor puerilities should never be quoted and absurdities can never be believed mazarin exercised his power with moderation at the beginning it is necessary to have lived a long time with a minister to be able to draw his character to determine what degree of courage or weakness there was in his mind or how far he was prudent or knavish therefore without pretending to guess at what mazarin really was we shall only say what he did in the first days of his greatness he affected as much humility as richelieu had displayed haughtiness instead of taking a guard for his person and appearing in public with royal pomp he had at first a very modest retinue and substituted an air of affability and even of softness in all things where his predecessor had shown an inflexible pride the    queen was desirous to make the court and the people fond of her person and authority in which she succeeded gaston duke of orleans brother of louis xiii and the prince of condé supported her power and had no emulation but that of serving the state it was found necessary to levy taxes in order to maintain the war with spain and the empire some were accordingly imposed which were in fact very moderate compared with those which we have since paid and very insufficient to the wants of the crown the parliament who had the power of authenticating the edicts for these taxes strongly opposed that of the tariff and gained the confidence of the people by continually thwarting the schemes of the ministry in short the creation of twelve new places of masters of requests and the withholding of about eight thousand crowns from the salaries of the superior companies caused an insurrection among all the people of the long robe and with them of all paris and what at this time would hardly be of consequence enough to make a paragraph in a newspaper then stirred up a civil war broussel counsellorclerk of the upper chamber a man of no capacity and whose only merit was that of being the foremost to open all arguments against the court having been put under arrest the people expressed more concern than they had ever shown at the death of a good king the barricades of the    league were now revived the flame of sedition burst out in an instant and raged so fiercely as hardly to be quenched being industriously fed by the coadjutor afterward cardinal de retz this was the first bishop who had ever excited a civil war without a religious pretext this extraordinary man has given us his own portrait in his memoirs which are written with an air of greatness an impetuosity of genius and an inequality which form a perfect image of his conduct he was a man who in the midst of the most debauched course of life and still languishing with the consequences it produces had the art of haranguing the people with success and making himself idolized by them he breathed nothing but faction and conspiracy at the age of twentythree he had been at the head of a conspiracy which was hatched against the life of cardinal de richelieu he was the contriver of the barricades he always urged the parliament on to cabals and the people to seditions what is most extraordinary is that the parliament wholly guided by him set up their standard against the court even before they had the countenance or assistance of any prince this assembly had for a long time been looked upon in a different light by the court and the people according to the declaration of all the ministers of state and of the court itself the parliament of paris was a court of justice set apart for trying causes between the subjects this prerogative it  0 held purely from the will of our kings and had no other preeminence over the other parliaments of the kingdom than that of seniority it was a court of peers only because the court generally resided at paris it had no greater right to make remonstrances than the other bodies in the state and this right was a matter of pure indulgence it had succeeded those parliaments which heretofore represented the french nation but it retained nothing more of those ancient assemblies than the bare name an incontestable proof of which is that the general estates were actually substituted in the place of the national assemblies and the parliament of paris no more resembled the ancient parliaments held by our first kings than a consul of smyrna or aleppo resembles a roman consul this single mistake in the name served as a pretext to the ambitious pretensions of a body of men in the long robe all of whom by having purchased their seats looked upon themselves as entitled to fill the places of the conquerors of the gauls and the lords of crown fiefs this body has at all times abused the power which a chief tribunal always existing in a capital necessarily arrogates to itself it had the boldness to issue an arret against charles vii and to banish him from his kingdom it began a criminal process against henry iii it always to the utmost of its power opposed its sovereigns and in this minority of louis xiv under the most mild of governments and the most indulgent of    queens it attempted to raise a civil war against its prince after the example of the english parliament which at that time kept its king a prisoner and condemned him to lose his head such was the manner of speaking and the thoughts of the cabinet but the citizens of paris and all those connected with the long robe looked upon the parliament of paris as an august body that dispensed justice with a laudable integrity that had the good of the state only at heart which it cherished at the hazard of its own fortune that confined its ambition to the glory of curbing the aspiring designs of favorites that preserved an equal conduct between the prince and the people and the people without inquiring into the origin of its rights or authority supposed it possessed of the most sacred privileges and indisputable authority and when they saw it maintaining the public cause against ministers whom they hated gave it the title of the father of the state and placed a very small difference between the right by which the kings hold their crowns and that which gives the parliament a power to lay a restriction upon the wills of kings it was impossible then to hit upon a medium between these two very opposite extremes for in short there was no other fixed law but that of time and circumstances under a vigorous administration the parliament was nothing under a weak king it was allpowerful and that is very applicable which    was said by m de guimené when this body in the reign of louis xiii complained of the deputies of the noblesse for having taken precedence of it gentlemen you will have ample revenge in the minority we shall not repeat in this place all that has been written concerning these troubles nor copy whole volumes to recall to observation the numerous circumstances which were then thought so important and dear and are now almost buried in oblivion it is our business to speak of what characterizes the spirit of the nation and not dwell so much upon what relates to the civil wars in general as to what particularly distinguishes that of the fronde as it was called two powers which were instituted wholly for the maintenance of peace and harmony amongst mankind namely an archbishop and a parliament having begun these troubles the people looked upon themselves as justified in the greatest extravagances the queen could no longer appear abroad without being insulted in the grossest manner she was called by no other name than that of dame anne or if any other title was added it was generally an injurious one the populace reproached her in the most virulent terms with her fondness for mazarin and what was yet more insufferable her ears were filled in all places where she went with ballads and lampoons the monuments of low ribaldry and    malice which seemed calculated to convey a lasting suspicion of her virtue she was now obliged to fly—jan       —from paris with her children her minister the duke of orleans and even the great condé himself and to retire to st germain and reduced to pawn the crown jewels for subsistence the king was frequently in want of necessaries the pages of his bedchamber were dismissed because they could no longer be maintained at that time even louis xivs aunt the daughter of henry the great and consort to the king of england who had taken refuge in paris after having been expelled from her own kingdom was then reduced to the utmost extremities of poverty and her daughter who was afterward married to the brother of louis xiv lay in bed for want of clothes to keep her warm while the people of paris blinded with their mad rage paid not the least attention to the sufferings of so many royal personages the queen with tears in her eyes besought the great condé to protect the young king the conqueror of rocroi freiburg lens and nördlingen could not belie those great services he found himself agreeably flattered with the honor of defending a court which had been ungrateful to his merits against rebels who sought his assistance the parliament then had the great condé to encounter and yet dared to carry on the war the prince of conti brother to the great condé    who was as jealous of his elder brother as he was incapable of equalling him the dukes of longueville bouillon and beaufort all animated with the same restless spirit as the coadjutor all fond of novelties full of the hopes of aggrandizing themselves on the ruins of the state and of making the blind motions of parliament subservient to their own private interests went in a body and offered their services to that prelate the high chamber then proceeded to appoint generals for an army which was not yet raised everyone taxed himself to raise troops there were twenty counsellors possessed of new posts which had been created by cardinal de richelieu their brethren by a meanness of spirit of which every society is susceptible seemed to wreak their vengeance against the memory of cardinal richelieu upon them they gave them a thousand mortifications would hardly look upon them as members of the parliament and obliged each of them to pay fifteen thousand livres toward the expense of the war and to purchase the forbearance of those of their own body the high chancellor the courts of inquests and requests the chamber of accounts and the court of aids who had so loudly inveighed against a trifling and necessary tax which did not exceed a hundred thousand crowns now furnished a sum amounting nearly to ten millions of our present money for the subversion of their country twelve thousand men were raised by an arret of parliament every house    with a great gate furnished a man and a horse whence this body of horse got the name of the greatgate cavalry the coadjutor had a regiment of his own which was called the regiment of corinth because he was titular archbishop of corinth had it not been for the names of the king of france the great condé and the capital of the kingdom this war of the fronde would have been as ridiculous as that of the barberini no one knew for what he was in arms the prince of condé besieged five hundred thousand citizens with eight thousand soldiers the parisians came out into the field dressed in ribbons and plumes of feathers and their evolutions were the sport of the military people they took to their heels at the sight of two hundred men of the kings army all this was made a subject of raillery the regiment of corinth having been beaten by a small party of the kings troops this little repulse was called the first of the corinthians the twenty counsellors who had furnished fifteen thousand livres apiece had no other distinction than that of being called the twenty fifteens the duke of beaufort who was the idol of the people and the instrument made use of in stirring them up to sedition though a popular prince had but a narrow understanding and was a public object of raillery both with the court and those of his own party he was never mentioned but by the    name of the king of the mob the parisian troops after sallying out of the city and always coming back beaten were received with peals of laughter they repaired the repulses they met with by sonnets and epigrams the taverns and brothels were the tents where they held their councils of war in the midst of singing laughing and the most disolute pleasures the general licentiousness was carried to such a height that one night some of the principal officers of the malcontents having met the holy sacrament which was being carried through the streets to a sick person whom they suspected of being a mazarinian they drove the priest back again with the flat of their swords in short the coadjutor coming to take his seat in parliament as archbishop of paris the handle of a poniard was seen sticking out of his pocket upon which some one cried out behold our archbishops breviary in the midst of all these troubles the nobility assembled in a body at the convent of the augustine friars appointed syndics and held public sessions it might have been supposed this was to remodel the government and convoke the general estates but it was only to settle a claim to the tabouret which the queen had granted to madame de pons perhaps there never was a stronger proof of that levity of mind of which the french were then accused the civil discords under which england groaned at the very same time may serve to show the character    of the two nations there was a gloomy desperation and a sort of national rage in the civil wars of the english everything was decided by the sword scaffolds were erected for the vanquished and their king who was taken prisoner in a battle was brought as a culprit before a court of justice examined concerning the abuse he was said to have made of his power condemned to lose his head and executed in sight of all his subjects with as much regularity and with the same forms of justice as if he had been a private man condemned for a crime while during the course of these dreadful troubles the city of london was not even for a moment affected with the calamities incident to a civil war the french on the contrary ran headlong into seditions through caprice laughing all the time women were at the head of factions and love made and broke cabals the duchess of longueville in      prevailed on turenne lately made a marshal of france to persuade the army which he commanded for the king to revolt turenne failed and quitted like a fugitive the army of which he was general to please a woman who made a jest of his passion from general of france he descended to be the lieutenant of don estevan de gamara with whom he was defeated at rethel by the kings troops everyone knows this billet of marshal dhoquincourt to the duchess of montbazon perrone belongs to the fairest of the fair and the following verses which the duke of rochefoucauld wrote on    the duchess of longueville when he received a wound by a musket at the battle of st anthony by which he was for some time deprived of sight   pour mériter son cœur pour plaire à ses beaux yeux   jai fait la guerre aux rois  laurais faite aux dieux the war ended and was renewed again at several different times and there was not a person who had not frequently changed sides the prince of condé having brought the court back in triumph to paris indulged himself in the satisfaction of despising those he had defended and thinking the rewards bestowed on him unequal to his reputation and the services he had done he was the first to turn mazarin into ridicule to brave the queen and insult a government which he had disdained he is said to have written in this style to the cardinal to the most illustrious scoundrel and that taking his leave of him one day he said farewell mars he encouraged the marquis of jarsai to make a declaration of love to the queen and pretended to be angry that she was affronted with it he joined with his brother the prince of conti and the duke of longueville who quitted the party of the malcontents the party formed by the duke of beaufort at the beginning of the regency had been nicknamed the selfsufficients condés faction was called the petitsmaîtres because they wanted to be masters of the state there are no other traces left of all these terms except the name of petitmaître which is    nowadays applied to young men of agreeable persons but badly educated and that of frondeurs or grumblers which is given to those who censure the government the coadjutor who had declared himself an implacable enemy to the adminstration was privately reconciled to the court in order to obtain a cardinals hat and sacrificed condé to the ministers resentment in a word this prince who had defended the state against its enemies and the court against the rebels condé at the summit of his glory and who always acted more like the hero than the man of prudence saw himself arrested together with the prince of conti and the duke of longueville he might have governed the state if he would only have endeavored to please but he was contented with being admired the people of paris who had made barricades for a counsellorclerk hardly a degree removed from a fool made public rejoicings when the hero and defender of france was hurried away to the dungeon of vincennes a year afterward the very men who had sold the great condé and the other princes to the dastardly revenge of mazarin obliged the queen to open the gates of their prisons and drive her prime minister out of the kingdom condé now returned amidst the acclamations of that very people who had shown such hatred to him and by his presence occasioned new cabals and dissensions  0 the kingdom remained for some years longer in this tumultuous situation the government always the dupe of weak and uncertain councils seemed now on the point of ruin but dissension which had always prevailed among the rebels saved the court the coadjutor who was sometimes a friend and at others an enemy to the prince of condé stirred up a part of the parliament and people against him and boldly undertook at the same time to serve the queen by opposing this prince and to insult her by obliging her to banish cardinal mazarin who retired to cologne the queen by a contradiction too common to weak administrations was obliged at once to accept of his services to put up with his insults and to nominate to the purple this very man who when coadjutor had been the author of the barricades and had caused the royal family to quit their capital and besiege it chapter iv continuation of the civil war till the end of the rebellion in      at length condé determined upon a war which he should have begun in the time of the rebellion if he was desirous of being master of the state or never to have undertaken if he meant to live as a subject he quitted paris armed the provinces of guienne poitou and anjou and applied for aid    against his own country to those spaniards of whom he had so lately been the most dreadful scourge nothing can better show the madness of these times and the confused manner of proceeding than what then happened to this prince a courier was sent to him from paris with proposals for engaging him to return and lay down his arms the courier by a mistake instead of going to angerville where the prince then was went to augerville the letter came too late condé declared that if he had received it sooner he would have accepted the proposals for peace but since he was now at such a distance from paris it was not worth while to go back thus by the mistake of a courier and the mere capriciousness of this prince france was once more plunged in a civil war and now cardinal mazarin who while an exile at the farther end of cologne had still continued to govern the court returned to france in december      rather like a sovereign who returns to take possession of his dominions than like a minister coming to resume his post he was escorted by a small army of seven thousand men raised wholly at his own expense that is to say with the governments money which he had appropriated to his own use the king in a declaration at this time is made to say that the cardinal actually raised those troops with his own money which at once overturns the opinion of those writers who say that when he first    left the kingdom he was very poor he gave the command of his small army to marshal dhoquincourt all the officers wore green sashes which was the color of the cardinals livery each party at that time had its particular sash the kings was white and the prince of condés yellow it was surprising that cardinal mazarin who had all along affected so much humility and modesty should have had the arrogance to make a whole army wear his livery as if he had been of a different party from the king his master but he could not resist this emotion of vanity the queen approved of it and the king who was then of age with his brother went to meet him on the first news of his return gaston duke of orleans brother of louis xiii who had insisted upon his being banished began to raise troops in paris without well knowing how he was to employ them the parliament renewed its arrets proscribed mazarin and set a price upon his head they were obliged to consult the registers for the price paid for the head of an enemy to the state and they found that in the reign of charles ix the sum of fifty thousand crowns had been promised by arret to any person who should produce admiral coligny alive or dead it was therefore seriously determined to act according to form by setting the same price on the assassination of a cardinal and prime minister no one however was tempted to gain the fifty thousand crowns offered by the proscription which after all would never have    been paid in any other nation or at any other time such an arret would have met with persons to put it in execution but now it served only to afford new subject of raillery blot and marigni two witty writers who mingled gayety with these tumults and disorders caused a paper to be fixed up in the public places of paris offering a reward of one hundred and fifty thousand livres divided into shares so much to the person who should cut off the cardinals nose so much for an ear so much for an eye and so much for the person who would make him a eunuch this raillery was the only effect produced by this proscription the cardinal on his side made no use of either poison or assassination against his enemies and notwithstanding the rancor and madness of so many factions and their hatred no very great crimes were committed on any side the heads of parties were not inclined to cruelty nor were the people very furious for it was not a religious war the whimsical spirit which prevailed at that time had taken such thorough possession of the body of the parliament of paris that having solemnly ordered an assassination which was laughed at they issued an arret by which a certain number of counsellors were ordered to repair to the frontiers and take depositions against the army of cardinal mazarin that is to say the kings army two of these counsellors had the imprudence to take some peasants with them and break down the    bridges over which the cardinal was to pass they were taken prisoners in the attempt by a body of the kings troops but were released again without any further punishment than that of being laughed at by all parties at the very time that this body was running into these extremes against the kings minister it declared the prince of condé who had taken up arms solely to oppose this minister guilty of high treason and by a strange reverse of judgment which nothing but their former actions could render credible they ordered the fresh troops which had been raised by gaston duke of orleans to march against mazarin and at the same time prohibited any sums to be taken out of the public funds to pay them nothing else could be expected from a body of magistrates which thrown quite out of its proper sphere ignorant of its own rights and real power and as little acquainted with state affairs and war meeting in a tumultuous manner and passing decrees in hurry and confusion took measures which it had not thought of the day before and which afterward astonished it the parliament of bordeaux which was at that time in the prince of condés interest observed a more uniform conduct because being at a greater distance from the court it was not so much agitated by opposite factions    but objects of greater importance now engrossed the attention of all france condé in league with the spaniards appeared in the field against the king and turenne having deserted those spaniards with whom he had been defeated at rethel had just made his peace with the court and commanded the kings army the finances were already too much drained to allow either of the two parties to keep large armies on foot but small ones were sufficient to decide the fate of the kingdom there are times when an army of one hundred thousand men is barely sufficient to take two towns and there are others in which eight thousand men may subvert or establish a throne louis xiv who was brought up in adversity wandered with his mother his brother and cardinal mazarin from province to province with not nearly so many troops to attend his person as he afterward had in time of peace for his ordinary guard while an army of five or six thousand men part sent from spain and part raised by the prince of condé pursued him to the very heart of his kingdom the prince of condé in the meantime made quick marches from bordeaux to montauban taking towns and increasing his numbers in every place all the hopes of the court were centred in marshal turenne the kings army was at guienne on the loire and the prince of condés a few leagues distant under the command of the dukes of nemours and beaufort the misunderstanding between these    two generals nearly proved fatal to the princes party the duke of beaufort was unfit for the least command the duke of nemours passed for a brave and amiable rather than a skilful general the army was ruined by them both together the men who knew that the great condé was a hundred leagues distant from them looked upon themselves as lost when in the middle of the night a courier presented himself to the main guard in the forest of orleans the sentinels presently discovered this courier to be the prince himself who had come post from agen through a thousand adventures and always in disguise to put himself at the head of his army his presence did a great deal and this unforeseen arrival still more he knew that men are elated with whatever is sudden and unexpected he therefore took immediate advantage of the confidence and boldness with which his presence had inspired his troops it was this princes distinguishing talent in war to form the boldest resolutions in an instant and to execute them with equal prudence and promptitude the royal army was divided into two corps condé attacked that which lay at bléneau under the command of marshal dhoquincourt which was shattered almost as soon as attacked turenne could not receive advice of this cardinal mazarin struck with a panic flew to gien in the midst of the night to awaken the king and acquaint him with this news his little court was struck with consternation it    was proposed to save the king by flight and convey him privately to bourges the victorious condé advanced toward gien and the fear and desolation became universal turenne however quieted the apprehensions of the people by his steadiness and saved the court by his dexterity with the few troops he had left he made such dexterous movements and so well improved his ground and time that he prevented condé from prosecuting the advantage he had gained it was difficult at that time to determine which of these two generals had acquired the most honor condé by the victory he had gained or turenne by having snatched the fruits of his victory from him it is certain that in this battle of bléneau which for a long time continued to be famous in france there were not above four hundred men killed nevertheless the prince of condé was on the point of making himself master of the whole royal family and of getting his enemy the cardinal into his hands there could not well be a smaller battle greater concerns depending or a more pressing danger condé who did not flatter himself with the notion of surprising turenne as he had done hoquincourt made his army march to paris and hastened to enter that city and enjoy the glory he had acquired in the favorable dispositions of a blinded people the admiration of this last action which was exaggerated in all its circumstances had raised in all ranks of people the general hatred to mazarin and the name    and presence of the great condé seemed at first to make him absolute master of the capital but in fact the minds of the people in general were divided and each party was split into different factions as is the case in all civil troubles the coadjutor now cardinal de retz who had apparently been reconciled to a court that feared him and whom he equally distrusted was no longer master of the people nor acted the principal part in these transactions he governed the duke of orleans and opposed condé the parliament fluctuated between the court the duke of orleans and the prince but all sides joined in crying out against mazarin every one in private took care of his own concerns the people were like a stormy ocean whose waves were driven at hazard by many contrary winds the shrine of st geneviève was carried in procession through paris to obtain the expulsion of the cardinal minister and the populace did not in the least doubt that the saint would perform this miracle in the same manner as she grants rain nothing was to be seen but negotiations between the heads of parties deputations from the parliament meetings of the chambers seditions among the people and soldiers all over the country guards were mounted even at the gates of convents the prince had called in the spanish to his assistance charles iv duke of lorraine who had been driven out of his dominions and who had nothing left but an army of eight thousand men which he sold every    year to the spanish king advanced with this army toward paris but cardinal mazarin offering him more money to return than he was to have from the prince of condé for advancing the duke soon withdrew from france after having laid the countries waste in his march and carried off a handsome sum of money from both sides condé then remained in paris where his power was every day growing weaker and his army dwindling away while turenne conducted the king and his court toward the capital the king who was then fifteen years old beheld from the heights of charonne the battle of st anthony in which these two generals with a handful of troops performed such great things as considerably increased the reputation of both which already seemed incapable of addition the prince of condé with a few noblemen of his party and a small number of soldiers sustained and repelled the efforts of the kings army the king himself attended by cardinal mazarin beheld this fight from a neighboring eminence the duke of orleans uncertain which side to take kept within his palace of luxembourg and cardinal de retz remained in his archbishopric the parliament waited the issue of the battle to enact new decrees the people who at that time were equally afraid of the kings troops and the princes had shut the city gates and would not suffer anyone to come in or go out while the most noble blood of the kingdom  0 was streaming in the suburbs there it was that the duke de la rochefoucauld who was so famous for his courage and wit received a blow over his eyes which deprived him of his sight for some time nothing was to be seen but young noblemen killed or wounded being carried to st anthonys gate which was kept shut at length the daughter of the duke of orleans taking condés part whom her father had not dared to assist ordered the gates to be opened for the wounded and had the boldness to fire the cannon of the bastille upon the kings troops the royal army retired condé gained only glory but mademoiselle ruined herself forever with the king her cousin by this imprudent violence and cardinal mazarin who knew the great desire she had to espouse a crowned head observed that those cannon had killed her husband most of our historians amuse their readers only with accounts of the battles fought and the prodigies of valor and politics displayed on these occasions but whoever is acquainted with the shameful expedients which were put in practice the wretchedness which was brought upon the people and the meanness to which all sides were reduced will look upon the glory of the heroes of these times with more pity than admiration as we may judge from what we find related by gourville a man who was devoted to the prince of condé this writer acknowledges that he himself in order to procure money for the    prince on a pressing occasion was obliged to rob a receivers office and that he went one day and seized a director of the posts in his own house and obliged him to purchase his liberty with a sum of money he relates all these outrages as common occurrences at that time after the bloody and indecisive battle of st anthony the king could neither enter paris nor could the prince of condé think of remaining there much longer a commotion of the populace and the deaths of several citizens of which he was thought to be the author had made him hateful in the eyes of the people nevertheless he had still a party in the parliament this body who had then little to apprehend from the resentment of a wandering court driven as it were from their capital being pressed by the duke of orleans and the princes cabals issued an arret declaring the former lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom though the king was then of age this was the title that had been conferred on the duke of mayenne in the time of the league the prince of condé was appointed generalissimo of the forces the court incensed at these proceedings ordered the parliament to remove itself to pontoise which some few of the counsellors did so that there were now two parliaments who disputed each others authority enacted contradictory decrees and would by this means have fallen into universal contempt had they not always agreed in demanding the cardinals expulsion so much was a hatred to that minister    looked upon at that time as the essential duty of a frenchman at that time all parties were alike weak and the court was as much so as the rest they all wanted men and money factions were daily increasing the battles which had been fought on both sides had produced only losses and vexations the court found itself obliged once more to give up mazarin whom everyone accused of being the cause of these troubles while he was in fact only the pretence accordingly he quitted the kingdom a second time and as an additional disgrace the king was obliged to issue a public declaration by which he banished his minister while he commended his services and lamented his exile charles i of england had lately lost his head upon a scaffold for having at the beginning of his troubles sacrificed the life of his friend and counsellor the earl of strafford to his parliaments resentment on the other hand louis xiv became the peaceable master of his kingdom by agreeing to the banishment of mazarin thus the same weakness had very different successes the king of england by giving up his favorite emboldened a people who delighted in war and had a hatred to all kings and louis xiv—or rather the queenmother—by banishing the cardinal took away all pretence for a revolt from a people who had grown weary of war and had an affection for the royal character no sooner had the cardinal departed on his way    to bouillon the place fixed for his new retreat than the citizens of paris of their own accord sent deputies to the king to beseech him to return to his capital which he accordingly did and everything appeared so peaceable that it would have been difficult to suppose that a few days before all had been in confusion gaston of orleans ever unfortunate in his undertakings for want of spirit to carry them through was banished to blois where he passed the rest of his days in repentance and he was the second of the great henrys sons who died without glory cardinal de retz who was perhaps as imprudent as he was bold and aspiring was arrested in the louvre and after being carried from prison to prison he for a long time led a wandering life which at length ended in retirement where he acquired virtues which his high spirit had made him a stranger to amidst the tumults of his fortune some counsellors of the parliament who had most abused their power paid the forfeit of their faults by banishment the rest were restricted within the proper limits of the magisterial function and some were encouraged to do their duty by a yearly gratification of five hundred pounds which was paid them privately by fouquet procureurgeneral and comptroller of the finances in the meantime the prince of condé abandoned in france by almost all his partisans and but weakly seconded by the spaniards still carried on an unsuccessful war on the frontiers of champagne    there were still some few factions in bordeaux but they were soon quelled the calm which the kingdom now enjoyed was owing to the banishment of cardinal mazarin yet scarcely was he expelled by the general cry of the french nation and by the royal declaration than he was recalled by the king and to his infinite surprise entered paris once more in full power and without the least disturbance in march      the king received him as a father and the people as a master a public entertainment was made for him at the townhouse amidst the acclamations of the citizens he distributed money among the populace on this occasion but amidst all the satisfaction he received in this happy change he is said to have shown a contempt for our levity and inconstancy the parliament who had before set a price upon his head as a public robber now sent deputies to compliment him and this very parliament a short time afterward passed sentence of death on the prince of condé for contumacy a change common in such times and which was the more base as by this decree they condemned the very man in whose crimes they had been so long partakers the cardinal also who urged this condemnation of the great condé was soon afterward seen to give one of his nieces in marriage to the prince of conti condés brother a proof that this ministers power would soon become boundless    chapter v france till the death of cardinal mazarin      while the state was thus torn in pieces within it had been attacked and weakened from without all the fruits of the victories of rocroi lens and nördlingen were lost the important fortress of dunkirk was retaken by the spaniards who had also driven the french out of barcelona and retaken casale in italy yet notwithstanding the tumults of the civil broils and the weight of a foreign war mazarin had in      been fortunate enough to conclude the famous peace of westphalia by which the emperor and the empire sold the sovereignty of alsace to the king and the crown of france for three millions of livres—about six millions of our present money—to be paid to the archduke which became the basis of all future treaties a new electorate was created in favor of the house of bavaria the rights of all the princes and cities of the empire and even the privileges of every private gentleman were settled at this peace the emperors power was restricted within very narrow limits and the french in conjunction with the swedes became the lawgivers of germany the glory accruing to france was in part owing to the swedish arms gustavus adolphus had first begun to shake the empire his generals had also pushed their conquests    quite extensively under the government of his daughter christina general wrangel was ready to enter into austria count königsmarck was master of one half of the city of prague and was laying siege to the other half when this peace was concluded and to overwhelm the emperor in this manner cost france only a million a year in subsidies to the swedes and indeed the swedes gained more advantage from this treaty than the french they had pomerania several fortified places and a considerable sum of money they obliged the emperor to deliver into the hands of the lutherans certain benefices which belonged to the roman catholics the court of rome set up the cry of impiety and loudly declared that the cause of god and religion was betrayed the protestants boasted that they had sanctified the work of peace by stripping the papists everyone speaks as interest dictates the spanish court did not accede to this peace and with good reason for seeing france overwhelmed with its civil wars the spanish ministry hoped to profit by our dissensions the german troops which were now disbanded served as a fresh reinforcement to the spaniards the emperor after the peace of münster sent thirty thousand men into flanders in the space of four years this was a manifest violation of treaties but they are seldom executed in any other manner the ministers of the court of madrid had the a    address in this treaty of westphalia to make a separate peace with the dutch the spanish monarchy in short thought itself happy to have no longer for enemies and to acknowledge as sovereigns those whom they had so long treated as rebels unworthy of pardon these republicans increased their wealth and secured their tranquillity and greatness by thus treating with spain without breaking with france  they were so powerful that in      in a war which they had with england they sent a hundred ships of the line to sea and victory long remained doubtful between blake the english admiral and tromp who commanded the dutch fleet who were both at sea what condé and turenne were on shore france had not at that time ten ships of fifty guns fit to send to sea and her navy was every day falling more and more into decay louis xiv then saw himself in      absolute master of the kingdom which was still affected by the shocks it had received full of disorder in every branch of the administration but abounding in resources without any ally except the duke of savoy to assist it in carrying on an offensive war and having no foreign enemies but spain which was then in a worse condition than france itself all the french who had been concerned in the civil war were subjected except the prince of condé and some few of his partisans of which one or two remained faithful to him through friendship and    gratitude as the counts de coligny and bouteville and some others because the court would not buy their services at an exorbitant price condé now made general of the spanish forces could not recruit a body which he himself had weakened by the destruction of its infantry in the battles of rocroi and lens he fought with new troops of which he was not master against the veteran regiments of the french who had learned to conquer under him and were now commanded by turenne it was the fortune of condé and turenne to be always conquerors when they fought together at the head of the french and to be beaten when they commanded the spaniards turenne had with great difficulty saved the shattered remains of the spanish army at the battle of rethel where from being general to the king of france he became lieutenant to don estevan de gamarra the prince of condé met with the same fate before arras he and the archduke were besieging that town turenne came and besieged them in their camp forced their lines and the archdukes troops were put to flight condé with only two regiments of french and lorrainers sustained the attack of all turennes army and while the archduke was flying he beat marshal hoquincourt repulsed marshal de la ferté and covered the retreat of the defeated spaniards upon which the spanish king wrote to him in these terms i have heard that all was lost and that you have saved all    it is difficult to say by what battles are lost or won but it is certain that condé was one of the greatest military geniuses that had ever appeared and that the archduke and his council refused to do anything that day which condé had proposed though raising the siege of arras forcing the enemys lines and putting the archduke to flight reflected the highest glory on turenne it was observed that in the letter written in the kings name to the parliament upon this victory the whole success of the campaign was attributed to cardinal mazarin without the least mention of turennes name the cardinal was actually within a few leagues of arras with the king he had even gone into the camp at the siege of stenai a town which turenne had taken before he relieved arras several councils of war had been held in the cardinals presence on this he founded his pretension to the honor of these events and by this piece of vanity he drew ridicule upon himself which not all the authority of prime minister could efface the king was not present at the battle of arras though he might have been so he had been in the trenches at the siege of stenai but the cardinal would not suffer him to hazard a person on which the tranquillity of the state and the power of the minister seemed alike to depend this war which was but weakly supported was carried on in their masters names on one side by mazarin who was absolute master of france and  0 its young monarch and on the other by don luis de haro who governed the spanish kingdom under philip iv the name of louis xiv was not then known to the world and the king of spain had never been spoken of there was no crowned head at that time in europe who enjoyed any share of personal reputation queen christina of sweden was the only one who governed alone and supported the dignity of the throne which was abandoned disgraced or unknown in other kingdoms charles ii king of england then a fugitive in france with his mother and brother had brought thither his misfortunes and his hopes a private subject had subdued england scotland and ireland cromwell that usurper so worthy of reigning had prudently taken the title of protector and not that of king as he knew that the english were acquainted with the extent of the royal prerogative but did not so well know the limits of a protectors authority he strengthened his power by knowing when to restrain it he made no attempt upon the rights of the people of which they were always jealous he never quartered soldiers upon the city of london nor imposed any tax which might occasion murmurings he did not offend the public eye with too much pomp he did not indulge himself in any pleasures nor did he heap up riches he took care that justice should be observed with that stern    impartiality which knows no distinction between the great and small the brother of pantaleon sá the portuguese ambassador in england thinking that he might act as he pleased with impunity because the person of his brother was sacred had committed an outrage upon some citizens of london and afterward caused some to be assassinated by his own people in revenge for the opposition he had met with from the rest for this he was condemned to be hanged cromwell though he had it in his power to save him suffered him to be executed and the next day signed a treaty with the ambassador never had the trade of england been in so free and so flourishing a condition nor the state so rich its victorious fleets made its name respected in every sea while mazarin wholly employed in governing and heaping up riches suffered justice trade navigation and even the revenue itself to languish and decline in france as much master in france as cromwell was in england after a civil war he might have procured the same advantages for the country which he governed as cromwell had done for his but mazarin was a foreigner and though of a less cruel disposition than cromwell wanted his greatness of soul all the nations of europe who had neglected an alliance with england during the reigns of james i and charles solicited it under cromwell queen christina herself though she had expressed her    detestation at the murder of charles i entered into an alliance with a tyrant whom she esteemed mazarin and don luis de haro vied with each other in exerting their politics to engage the protector in an alliance and he had for some time the satisfaction of seeing himself courted by the two most powerful kingdoms in christendom the spanish minister offered to assist him to take calais mazarin proposed to him to besiege dunkirk and to put that place into his hands cromwell had then at his option the keys of france and flanders he was also strongly solicited by the great condé but he would not enter into a negotiation with a prince who had nothing to depend upon but his name and who was without a party in france and without power among the spaniards the protector then determined in favor of france but without making any particular treaty or sharing conquests beforehand he was desirous to render his usurpation illustrious by great undertakings he had formed the design of taking america from the spaniards but they had timely notice of his intention his admirals however took the island of jamaica in may      which is still in possession of the english and secures their trade in the new world it was not till after the expedition to jamaica that cromwell signed his treaty with the french king and then no mention was made of dunkirk the protector treated with the french king as a prince with his equal and obliged him    to acknowledge his title of protector his secretary signed before the french plenipotentiary on the copy of the treaty which remained in england but he treated as a real superior when he obliged the french king to compel charles ii and his brother the duke of york both grandsons of henry iv and to whom france consequently owed an asylum to quit his dominions while mazarin was engaged in this treaty charles ii asked one of his nieces in marriage but the bad condition of this princes affairs which had obliged him to take this step was the cause of his meeting with a refusal and the cardinal was even suspected of an intention to marry the very niece whom he had refused to the king of england to cromwells son this however is certain that when he afterward found charless affairs take a more favorable turn he was for setting this match on foot again but then he met with a refusal in his turn the mother of these two princes henrietta of france daughter of henry the great who was left in france destitute of all assistance saw herself reduced to beg of the cardinal to intercede with cromwell that she might at least receive her jointure it was certainly the most extreme and grievous of all humiliations to be obliged to sue for subsistence to the man who had spilled her husbands blood on a scaffold mazarin after some few remonstrances in the queens favor to the english court acquainted her that he had not been able to obtain    anything she therefore continued in poverty at paris and with the shame and mortification of having implored cromwells pity while her sons went into the army commanded by the prince of condé and don john of austria to learn the art of war against france which had abandoned them the children of charles i thus driven out of france took refuge in spain upon this the spanish ministry loudly inveighed both by word of mouth and writing in all courts and especially at rome against the behavior of the cardinal who they said had sacrificed all laws divine and human all honor and religion to the murderer of a king and had driven out of france charles ii and the duke of york though cousins of louis xiv to please their fathers executioner no other reply was made to these outcries of the spaniards than the production of the very offers which they themselves had made to the protector the war was still carried on in flanders with various success turenne having laid siege to valenciennes together with the marshal de la ferté experienced the same reverse of fortune which had befallen condé before arras the prince seconded at that time by don john of austria more worthy of fighting by his side than the archduke had been forced marshal de la fertés lines took him prisoner and delivered valenciennes july         turenne then did what condé had done before in a like defeat he saved the routed army made head    everywhere against the enemy and in less than a month afterward went and laid siege to and took the small town of la capelle this was perhaps the first time that a defeated army had dared to undertake a siege this march of turennes which was so greatly admired and after which la capelle was taken was eclipsed by a still finer march of condés turenne had hardly sat down before cambray when condé at the head of two thousand horse penetrated through the army of the besiegers and after having routed everything that attempted to stop him threw himself into the town on may  0      he was received by the citizens on their knees as their deliverer thus did these two great men display all the power of their military genius in opposition to each other they were equally admired for their retreats for their victories for their good conduct and even for their faults which they always knew how to repair by their talents they alternately checked the progress of the two monarchies whom they served but the disordered state of the finances both in france and spain still proved a great obstacle to their success at length france acquired a more distinguished superiority by the league it had made with cromwell on one hand admiral blake went and burned the spanish galleons at the canary islands and thus deprived them of the only treasures with which they could carry on the war and on the other    twenty sail of english ships blocked up the port of dunkirk while six thousand veteran soldiers who had been concerned in the revolution in england were sent to reinforce turennes army and now dunkirk the most important place of all flanders was besieged by land and sea the prince of condé and don john of austria having assembled all their forces presented themselves before the city to raise the siege the eyes of all europe were attentively fixed on this great event cardinal mazarin carried louis xiv into the neighborhood of the theatre of war without suffering him to act a part therein though he was then upward of twenty years old the king remained in calais while his army attacked that of spain and gained on june         the most glorious victory which had been known since that of rocroi the prince of condés genius could do nothing that day against the superior forces of france and england the spanish army was destroyed and dunkirk capitulated soon after the king and his minister repaired thither to see the garrison march out the cardinal would not permit louis xiv to appear either in the light of a king or a warrior he had not money to distribute among the soldiers and indeed had hardly proper attendants whenever he went with the army he used to eat at mazarins or at the viscount turennes table this neglect of the royal dignity was not the effect of any contempt that louis xiv had for    show and parade but from the bad state of his affairs and the care taken by the cardinal to arrogate all splendor and authority to himself louis took possession of dunkirk only to deliver it up to lockhart cromwells ambassador mazarin endeavored by some finesse to elude the treaty and prevent the place being given up to the english but lockharts threats and the english resolution got the better of italian cunning it has been asserted by several persons that the cardinal who had arrogated to himself the affair of arras wanted to prevail on turenne to yield him likewise the honor of this battle du beccrespin count of moret was sent they say in the ministers name to propose to the general to write a letter by which it might appear that the cardinal himself had laid down the whole plan of operations turenne received these insinuations with the contempt they deserved and would not consent to avow a thing which would have brought disgrace on a general and ridicule on a churchman mazarin after this weakness had that of continuing at enmity with turenne till the day of his death some time after the siege of dunkirk sept         cromwell died aged fiftyfive years in the midst of the vast projects he had formed for the establishment of his own power and the glory of the nation he governed he had humbled the dutch dictated the conditions of a treaty with the portuguese conquered spain and forced france to solicit    his protection not long before his death on being informed of the haughty manner in which his admirals behaved at lisbon i am resolved said he to make the english republic as much respected as that of rome was in former times he was interred like a lawful sovereign and left behind him the reputation of a great king which threw a veil over the crimes of the usurper sir william temple pretends that cromwell designed before he died to enter into an alliance with spain against france and to recover calais by the help of the spanish arms as he had got dunkirk by those of france nothing was more agreeable to his character and politics he would have rendered himself the idol of the english by thus stripping one after another two nations whom they equally hated death however at once overturned his great designs his tyranny and the english greatness it is observable that the court of france went in mourning for cromwell and that the daughter of the duke of orleans was the only person who refused to pay this mark of respect to the memory of the murderer of a king her kinsman richard cromwell succeeded his father in the protectorship without any opposition and in the same manner as a prince of wales would have succeeded a king of england richard was a proof that the fate of a kingdom frequently depends upon the character of one man his genius was wholly different from that of his    father oliver he was possessed of all the meek virtues which make the good citizen and had none of that brutal intrepidity which sacrifices everything to its own interests he might have preserved the inheritance which his father had acquired by his labors if he would have consented to put to death three or four of the principal officers of the army who opposed his elevation but he chose rather to lay down the government than to reign by assassination and lived retired and almost unknown till the age of ninety in a country of which he had once been the sovereign after quitting the protectorship he made a voyage to france where being one day at montpellier the prince of conti brother of the great condé discoursing with him without knowing who he was observed oliver cromwell was a great man but his son richard was a poor wretch not to know how to enjoy the fruits of his fathers crimes this richard however lived contented whereas his father had never known what happiness was some time before france had seen another much more extraordinary example of the contempt of a crown in the famous christina of sweden who came to paris everyone admired a young princess so worthy of reigning who had resigned the sovereign authority for the sake of leading a life of ease and freedom it is shameful in the protestant writers to assert without the least shadow of proof that she resigned the crown only because she could keep  0 it no longer she had formed this design from the time she was twenty years of age and had allowed seven years to bring it to maturity a resolution so much above all vulgar conception and which had been formed for such a length of time should stop the mouths of those who reproach her with levity of disposition and of having been compelled to this abdication one of these accusations destroys the other but everything great and noble is sure to be attacked by narrow minds the extraordinary turn of mind of this princess is sufficiently shown by her letters in that which she wrote to chanut who had formerly been ambassador from france at her court she thus expresses herself i wore the crown without ostentation and i resign it with readiness after this you have nothing to fear for me my happiness is out of the reach of fortune she wrote thus to the great condé i think myself as much honored by your esteem as by the crown i have worn if after having resigned that you shall think me less deserving of the other i will own to you that the tranquillity i have so much desired will appear dearly bought but i shall never repent of having purchased it at the price of a crown nor will ever sully an act which to me appears so glorious by a mean repentance and if perchance you should condemn what i have done i shall only tell you in excuse that i should never have resigned the possessions which fortune bestowed on me had i judged them necessary to my    happiness and should even have aspired to the sovereignty of the world could i have been as certain of succeeding or dying in the attempt as the great condé would have been such was the soul of this extraordinary personage and such her style in our language which she was but rarely accustomed to speak she understood eight different languages she had been the friend and pupil of descartes who died in her palace at stockholm after having in vain tried to obtain a pension in france where his works were even forbidden to be read on account of the only good things which were in them she invited into her kingdom all who were capable of bringing any knowledge into it and the vexation of finding no men of learning among her own subjects had given her a dislike to reigning over a people who were unacquainted with everything but arms she judged it more eligible to live privately among thinking men than to rule over a people who had neither learning nor genius she patronized and cultivated all the arts in a country where they were till her time unknown and designed to make italy the place of her retreat where she might indulge herself in the midst of them and as they had but just begun to make their appearance in france she only passed through that kingdom on her way to rome where her inclination determined her to fix her abode and with this view she quitted the lutheran religion for the catholic equally indifferent to either she made no scruple of    outwardly conforming to the sentiments of a people among whom she was desirous of passing her life she quitted the throne in      and publicly performed the ceremony of her abjuration at innspruck she was admired at the french court though she surpassed all the women there in understanding the king saw her and did her the greatest honors but he did not discourse much with her he had been bred in ignorance and his natural good sense made him bashful the only extraordinary thing that the ladies and courtiers remarked in this philosophical queen was that she did not dress after the french fashion and that she danced badly the learned found nothing to condemn in her except the murder of monaldeschi her master of horse whom she caused to be assassinated at fontainebleau in the second journey she made to france for some fault he had been guilty of toward her as she had laid down the sovereign authority she had no longer a right to impose a sentence she could no longer be considered as a queen who punished a misdemeanor of state but as a private woman who ended a love affair by a murder this infamous and cruel action sullied that philosophy which had made her quit a throne had she been in england she would have been punished but the court of france winked at this insult against the royal authority the law of nations and humanity after cromwell was dead and his son richard    deposed england continued for a year in anarchy and confusion charles gustavus to whom queen christina had resigned the kingdom of sweden made himself formidable in the north and in germany emperor ferdinand died in      his son leopold who was seventeen years old and was already king of hungary and bohemia had not been chosen king of the romans during his fathers lifetime mazarin endeavored to have louis xiv chosen emperor this was a wild scheme he should have compelled or corrupted the electors to his interest but france was not in itself sufficiently powerful to seize on the empire nor rich enough to purchase it consequently the first overtures of this kind made at frankfort by marshals de gramont and lionne were laid aside almost as soon as proposed and leopold was chosen emperor all that mazarins policy could then effect was to engage the german princes in a league for securing the observance of the treaties of münster and to curb the emperors authority in the empire after the affair of dunkirk france became powerful abroad by the reputation of her arms and the bad condition to which other nations were reduced but she suffered greatly at home she was drained of money and in want of peace in christian monarchies the state itself is seldom interested in its sovereigns wars mercenary armies raised by the order of a minister and commanded by generals blindly devoted to his will carry    on several destructive campaigns without the princes in whose name they fight having the least expectation or even intention of depriving each other of their whole patrimony the people of the victorious state reap no advantage from the spoils of those who are conquered they pay all expenses and are alike sufferers whether their country be prosperous or unsuccessful peace therefore is as necessary to them even after the greatest victory as if their enemies were in possession of all their frontier places there were two things wanting for the cardinal to finish his administration happily the one was to bring about a peace and the other to secure the tranquillity of the nation by marrying the king the young monarch had been dangerously ill after the campaign of dunkirk insomuch that his life was despaired of the cardinal who knew he was not liked by the kings brother had some intention at this dangerous juncture of securing his immense riches and preparing for a retreat these considerations determined him to marry his royal pupil as soon as possible two parties presented themselves at that time the king of spains daughter and the princess of savoy the kings heart however had been previously engaged in a different way he was desperately in love with mademoiselle de mancini one of the cardinals nieces and as he was by nature amorous positive in his will and void of experience it was not unlikely that in the warmth of his passion    he might have determined to marry his favorite mistress madame de motteville the queenmothers confidante whose memoirs carry a great air of truth pretends that mazarin was tempted to give way to the kings passion and place his niece on the throne he had already married one of his nieces to the prince of conti and a second to the duke of mercœur and she whom louis xiv was so fond of had been demanded in marriage by the king of england these were so many encouragements to justify his ambition being one day alone with the queenmother he artfully attempted to sound her on this subject i am afraid said he that the king has a strong inclination to marry my niece the queenmother who knew the cardinal perfectly well presently conjectured that he wished what he affected to fear and with all the haughtiness of a princess of the austrian blood the daughter wife and mother of kings and full of resentment against a minister who seemed to have shaken off all dependence upon her she made him this reply were the king himself capable of such a meanness i would instantly put myself with my second son at the head of the people against the king and you it is said that mazarin never forgave the queen for this spirited answer but he was wise enough to fall in with her sentiments and made a merit of opposing the kings passion his power did not stand in need of a queen of his own blood to support it he    was even apprehensive of his nieces disposition and thought he should more effectually secure the authority of his place by shunning the dangerous glory of too greatly exalting his family he had in the year      sent lionne into spain to bring about a peace and demand the infanta in marriage but don luis de haro sensible that weak as spain was france was not much stronger had rejected the cardinals offers the infanta who was the child of a former marriage was destined for young leopold the spanish king had at that time only one son by his second wife and this young prince was of so infirm a constitution that it was imagined he could hardly live it was therefore determined that the infanta who was likely to become heiress to such large dominions should transfer her claims to the house of austria rather than to the family of an enemy but philip iv having afterward another son don philip prospero and his queen being again with child there did not appear so much danger in giving the infanta to the french king besides the battle of dunkirk had made him wish for a peace the spanish court then promised the infanta to louis xiv and desired a cessation of arms mazarin and don luis de haro met on the frontiers of the two kingdoms on the isle of pheasants notwithstanding that the design of their meeting was no less than that of settling the marriage of the king of france and a general peace a whole month was    taken up in determining the disputes which arose about precedence and in adjusting certain points of ceremony the cardinals insisted upon being equal with kings and superior to other sovereign princes france with more justice pretended to the preeminence over all other kings however don luis de haro kept up a perfect equality between mazarin and himself and between the crowns of france and spain the conferences lasted four months in which don luis and mazarin displayed the whole strength of their politics the cardinal excelled in finesse don luis was remarkable for his deliberation the former never spoke but with a double meaning the latter very sparingly the italian ministers talent lay in endeavoring to surprise that of the spaniard in guarding against a surprise it is reported that in speaking of the cardinal he said there is one great fault in his politics he is always endeavoring to deceive such is the vicissitude of human affairs that there are hardly two articles of this famous treaty of the pyrenees now subsisting the french king kept roussillon which he would always have kept without this peace but with respect to flanders the spanish monarchy has now nothing left there the court of france was at that time necessarily in friendship with portugal we are now no longer so everything is changed though don luis de haro accused cardinal mazarin of deceit the world has    since acknowledged that he had the gift of foresight he had for a long time formed the design of an alliance between france and spain witness that famous letter of his which he wrote during the conferences at münster if his most christian majesty could have the low countries and franchecomté as a marriage portion with the infanta in that case we might aspire to the spanish succession notwithstanding any renunciation made in the infantas name neither would it be a very distant prospect seeing that there is only the life of the prince her brother to exclude her from it this prince was balthazar who died in      it is plain that the cardinal was deceived in supposing that the court of spain would give the low countries and franchecomté with the infanta there was not a single town stipulated for a dowry with her on the contrary we restored several considerable towns to the spanish monarchy which we had taken from it during the course of the war such as st omer ypres menin oudenarde and some other places the cardinal however was right in supposing that the renunciation would one day be of no effect but those who give him the honor of this prediction suppose him to have likewise foreseen that prince balthazar would die in      that afterward the three children by the second wife would all die in the cradle that charles the fifth of all these male children would die without issue and that this austrian king would one day make a will    in favor of louis xivs grandson but the truth is that cardinal mazarin foresaw what value would be set upon a renunciation in case the male issue of philip iv should all fail and this was justified by a series of extraordinary events above fifty years afterward the infanta maria theresa who might have had for her dowry those towns which france by this treaty of marriage was obliged to restore instead of that had only five hundred thousand golden crowns for her fortune it cost the king more to go and receive her on the frontiers however these five hundred thousand crowns worth at that time about two million five hundred thousand livres were the subject of much altercation between the two ministers and at last we never received more than one hundred thousand francs so far was this marriage from being of any real present advantage excepting that of peace that the infanta renounced forever all right or claim to any of her fathers territories and louis xiv ratified this renunciation in the most solemn manner and caused it to be registered in parliament these renunciations and a portion of five hundred thousand crowns seemed to be customary clauses in the marriage contracts between the infantas of spain and the kings of france queen anne of austria daughter of philip iii was married to louis xiii on the same conditions and when isabella daughter of our henry the great was married  00 to philip iv king of spain there were no more than five hundred thousand crowns agreed upon for a portion with her and no part of that was ever paid so that there did not seem at that time to be any great advantage in these grand marriages charles iv duke of lorraine of whom france and spain had great reason to complain or rather who had great reason to complain of them was included in this treaty but on the footing of an unfortunate prince whom they punished because he could not make himself feared france restored him his dominions after dismantling nancy and prohibiting him from keeping any troops don luis de haro obliged cardinal mazarin to procure the prince of condés pardon threatening otherwise to bestow on him the sovereignty of rocroi châtelet and other places in which he was in possession thus france at once gained these towns and the great condé however he lost his post of master of the household to the king and returned with little else than glory charles ii the titular king of england who was still more unfortunate than the duke of lorraine came to the pyrenees while they were negotiating the peace to implore the assistance of the cardinal and don luis de haro he flattered himself that their kings who were his cousinsgerman being now in alliance would as cromwell was no more have the courage to avenge a cause which concerned every crowned head but he could not even obtain  0  an interview with either of the ministers lockhart cromwells ambassador was at st john de luz and made himself still respected notwithstanding the death of his master and the two ministers fearing to disoblige him refused to see charles they thought it impossible that he should ever be restored and were persuaded that all the english factions though at variance among themselves would unanimously join to exclude forever the kingly authority but herein they were both deceived and fortune a few months afterward brought about that which these ministers might have had the honor of undertaking charles was recalled by the english without a single potentate having interfered either to prevent the murder of the father or the sons restoration he landed at dover and was received by twenty thousand of his subjects on their knees i have been told by some old people who were on the spot that almost every one present was bathed in tears there never was perhaps a more affecting sight nor a more sudden revolution this change was brought about in less time than the treaty of the pyrenees took in concluding and charles ii was in quiet possession of the english throne before louis xiv was even married by proxy and now cardinal mazarin conducted the king and his new consort back to paris his behavior on this occasion was like that of a father who had married his son without allowing him to have the management of his estate this minister returned  0  more powerful and more jealous of his authority and dignity than ever he no longer gave the upper hand to the princes of the blood in a third place as formerly and he who had behaved toward don luis de haro as his equal attempted to treat the great condé as his inferior he now appeared in public with royal pomp having besides his ordinary guard a company of musketeers the same which is now the second company in the kings musketeers there was no longer any access to be had to the royal person and whosoever was so little of a courtier as to apply to the king for any favor was surely ruined the queenmother who had so long been this ministers firm protectress against the whole french nation saw herself left without credit as soon as he was no longer in want of her assistance the king her son who had been brought up in a blind submission to this minister was unable to throw off the yoke she had imposed upon him as well as herself she had a respect for her own work and louis xiv never dared to reign while mazarin was alive a minister is excusable for the evil he may do when the helm of the government is forced into his hands by storms of state but when there is a calm he is answerable for all the good he does not do mazarin did good to no one but himself and those related to him of the eight years of absolute and undisturbed authority which he enjoyed from his last return till the day of his death not one was  0  distinguished by any honorable or useful establishment for the college of the four nations was erected only in consequence of his last will he managed the finances like a steward whose master is immersed in debt the king would sometimes ask fouquet for money who used to answer sire there is none in your majestys coffers but my lord cardinal can lend you some mazarin was worth about two hundred millions according to the present value of money it is said in several memoirs that he acquired a great part of his wealth by means which were beneath the dignity of his post and that he obliged those who fitted out privateers to allow him a share in the profits of their cruises this has never been proved but the dutch suspected him of something of this nature a suspicion they could never have entertained of his predecessor cardinal richelieu it is said that he was troubled with some scruples of conscience on his deathbed though he died apparently with great courage he was certainly in apprehension for his riches of which he made a full donation to the king supposing that his majesty would restore them to him again in this he judged right for three days afterward the king returned his deed of gift soon afterward he died seemingly unregretted by anyone except the king who had already learned the art of dissembling the yoke began to sit heavy on his shoulders and he grew impatient to reign nevertheless he thought it prudent  0  to wear the appearance of concern for a death which put him in possession of his throne louis xiv and his court went into mourning for the cardinal a very extraordinary mark of honor and what henry iv had paid to the memory of the fair gabrielle destrées we shall not undertake in this place to examine whether cardinal mazarin was a great minister or not we leave his actions to speak for him and posterity to judge but we cannot forbear opposing that mistaken notion which ascribes a more than common understanding and an almost divine genius to those who have governed great kingdoms with tolerable success it is not a superior share of penetration that makes statesmen it is their particular character anyone that has a tolerable degree of understanding can usually discern what is to his interest a common citizen of amsterdam or of berne knows as much on this head as sejanus ximenes buckingham richelieu or mazarin but our conduct and our undertakings depend wholly upon the temperament of our souls and our successes depend upon fortune for example if one with a genius like that of pope alexander vi or his son borgia had undertaken to reduce rochelle he would have invited the principal citizens of the place into his camp under the sanction of the most solemn oaths and then have murdered them all mazarin would have got possession of the town two or three years later by gaining  0  over some of the citizens and sowing dissension among the rest don luis de haro would never have hazarded the undertaking richelieu after the example of alexander built a mole in the sea and entered as a conqueror but a stronger tide than usual or a little more diligence on the part of the english would have saved rochelle and have made richelieu pass for a mad adventurer we may judge of a mans character by the nature of his undertakings we may safely affirm that richelieus soul was full of pride and revenge that mazarin was prudent supple and avaricious but to know how far a minister is a man of understanding we must either have frequently heard him discourse or have read what he has written that which we every day see among courtiers frequently happens among statesmen he who has the greatest talents often fails while he who is of a more patient resolute supple and equable disposition succeeds in reading mazarins letters and cardinal de retzs memoirs we may easily perceive de retz to have been the superior genius nevertheless the former attained the summit of power and the latter was banished in a word it is a certain truth that to be a powerful minister little more is required than a middling understanding good sense and fortune but to be a good minister the prevailing passion of the soul must be a love for the public good and he is the greatest statesman who leaves behind him the noblest works of public utility  0  chapter vi louis xiv governs alone—he obliges the spanish branch of the house of austria to yield him the precedency everywhere and the court of rome to give him satisfaction—he purchases dunkirk sends aid to the emperor the dutch and the portuguese and renders his kingdom powerful and flourishing never was a court so full of intrigues and expectations as that of france while cardinal mazarin lay dying those among the women who had any claim to beauty flattered themselves with the hopes of governing a young prince who was only twentytwo years old and whom love had already influenced to make a tender of his crown to a favorite mistress the young courtiers imagined that they should easily renew the reign of favorites every one of the officers of state thought that he should fill the first place in the ministry not one of them suspecting that a king who had been brought up in such an ignorance of state affairs would venture to take the burden of government upon his own shoulders mazarin had kept the king in a state of nonage as long as he was able and had not till very lately let him into the mystery of reigning and then only because he had insisted upon being instructed they were so far from wishing to be governed by their sovereign that of all those who had been concerned  0  with mazarin in the administration not one applied to the king to know when he would give them an audience on the contrary every one asked him to whom they were to apply and were not a little surprised when louis answered to me their astonishment was still increased on finding him persevere he had for some time consulted his own strength and made a trial in secret of his capacity for reigning his resolution once taken he maintained it to the last moment of his life he appointed every minister proper limits to his power obliging them to give him an account of everything at certain hours showing them as much confidence as was necessary to give a proper weight to their office and carefully watching over them to prevent their abuse of it he began by restoring order in the finances which had been miserably mismanaged through a continuance of rapine he established proper discipline among the troops his court was at once magnificent and decent even the pleasures appeared there with a degree of lustre and greatness the arts were all encouraged and employed to the glory of the king and kingdom this is not the place for painting his character in private life nor in the domestic government of his kingdom we shall reserve this for a part by itself it is sufficient to say that the people who since the death of henry iv had never seen a true king and who detested the authority of a prime minister were filled with admiration and hope when they saw  0  louis xiv do at twentytwo years of age what henry did at fifty had henry iv had a prime minister he would have been lost because the hatred against a private man would have awakened twenty different factions which would have become too powerful if louis xiii had not had a minister that prince whose feeble and sickly constitution made his soul weak and enervated would have sunk beneath the weight of government louis xiv might or might not have had a prime minister without any danger there were not the least traces left of the old factions which had distracted the state there was now only a master and subjects in france louis at the very beginning showed that he aspired after glory and that he was resolved to make himself respected at home and abroad the ancient kings of europe had always pretended to an exact equality with each other this was natural but the kings of france always claimed that precedence which was due to the antiquity of their race and kingdom and if they yielded place to the emperors it was because mankind have hardly ever the courage to abolish a longestablished custom the head of the german republic though an elective prince with very little power of his own has undoubtedly the precedence of all kings in virtue of his title of cæsar and heir to charlemagne his german chancery does not even give the title of majesty to any other crowned head the kings of france might dispute the precedence with the emperors  0  as france had founded the real western empire of which the name only subsists in germany they could plead not only the superiority of a hereditary crown over an elective dignity but the advantage of being descended in an uninterrupted succession of sovereigns who reigned over a great monarchy several centuries before any of those houses who are now in possession of crowns had attained to the least degree of dignity however they were determined to assert their right of precedence over all the other potentates of europe they alleged in support of their claim the title of most christian to which the spanish kings opposed theirs of most catholic and since charles v had had a king of france prisoner at madrid the spanish pride had made them more tenacious than ever of their rank the english and swedes who pleaded none of these surnames at present acknowledged as little as was possible this superiority rome was the place where these pretensions were formerly canvassed the popes who disposed of kingdoms by a bull imagined they had a much greater right to settle the rank among crowned heads this court where everything passes in ceremony was the tribunal for trying these varieties of greatness france had always had the superiority there when she was more powerful than spain but since the reign of charles v spain had let slip no opportunity of maintaining an equality the dispute was left undetermined the precedence at a procession   0 or an elbowchair placed near the altar or opposite the pulpit were matters of triumph and established titles to that precedence the chimerical point of honor in these articles was at that time carried to as great extremes among crowned heads as duels were among private persons it happened in      that at the entry of a swedish ambassador at london count destrade ambassador from france and baron watteville ambassador from the court of spain disputed the way the spaniard having more money and a greater train of servants gained the english populace over to his interest who began to kill the french ambassadors coach horses and soon afterward fell upon his people who being wounded took to their heels and left the spaniards to proceed in triumph with their swords drawn louis xiv being informed of this insult offered to his ambassador immediately recalled the minister he had at madrid and ordered the spanish ambassador to leave france broke off the conferences which were then in progress in flanders on the subject of the limits and sent word to his fatherinlaw philip iv that unless he acknowledged the superiority of the french crown and repaired the affront which had been offered its ambassador by a public satisfaction he would instantly renew the war philip iv was not willing to plunge his kingdom into a fresh war for the sake of an ambassadors precedence he sent the count of fuentes to declare     to the king at fontainebleau in presence of all the foreign ministers who were then in france that the spanish ministers could no longer dispute the precedence with those of france this was not clearly acknowledging the kings preeminence but it was a sufficient avowal of the weakness of the spanish court this court which still preserved its haughtiness murmured for a long time at its humiliation since then several spanish ministers have renewed their old pretensions and actually obtained an equality at nimeguen but louis xiv at that time acquired by his resolution a real superiority in europe by convincing all the powers how much he was to be feared he had scarcely concluded this small affair with so much dignity when he showed still more on an occasion in which his glory seemed not so much interested during the long wars carried on against the spaniards in italy the behavior of the young french gentry had inspired the cautious and jealous italians with the notion of their being a headstrong and impetuous people the italians looked upon all the nations by whom theirs was overrun as barbarians and the french as barbarians more gay but at the same time more dangerous than the rest as they introduced into all families where they came a taste for pleasures with an air of contempt and debauchery with outrage in short they were dreaded everywhere and especially at rome the duke de créqui the french ambassador at     the popes court had greatly displeased the people of rome by his arrogant behavior his servants a set of people who always carry the faults of their masters to extremes committed the same disorders in rome as the unbridled youth of france did in paris who at that time prided themselves in attacking the city watch every night some of this noblemans servants took it into their heads to fall sword in hand upon a party of the corsi—who are the city guard at rome—and put them to flight the whole body of the corsi incensed at this ill usage and cheered by don mario chigi brother of alexander vii the reigning pope who hated the duke de créqui went with a multitude of his followers in arms and besieged the duke in his own house they even fired upon the ambassadresss coach as she was driving into her palace killed one of her pages and wounded several of her other servants the duke de créqui left rome loudly accusing the popes relatives and even his holiness himself of having countenanced this insult and murder the pope deferred giving him satisfaction as long as he possibly could in the belief that it requires only a little temporizing with the french for everything to be forgotten at the end of about four months he caused one of the corsican guard and a sbirro to be hanged and banished the governor of rome who was suspected of having authorized these violent proceedings but he was in no small consternation when he learned that the french     king threatened to lay siege to rome that he had already ordered troops to be transported into italy for that purpose and that marshal du plessispraslin was appointed general this affair had become a national quarrel and the king was determined to support the dignity of his crown the pope before he could be brought to make the concessions demanded of him implored the mediation of all the catholic princes and at the same time did all in his power to stir them up against louis xiv but the situation of affairs was at that time unfavorable for the holy father the emperor was attacked by the turks and spain was engaged in an unsuccessful war against the portuguese the court of rome therefore only irritated the king without being able to hurt him the parliament of provence summoned the pope to appear and seized upon his county of avignon at any other time such an insult upon the papal dignity would have been followed by a peal of excommunications from the vatican but those arms were now equally useless and ridiculous the holy father found himself under the necessity of giving way and was obliged to banish his own brother from rome to send his nephew cardinal chigi in character of legate a latere to render the king satisfaction to break the corsican guard and to erect a pillar in the city of rome with an inscription expressing the injury and reparation cardinal chigi was the first legate who had ever     been sent from the papal court to ask pardon before that the legates had always been sent to give laws and impose the tax of the tenth penny the king did not content himself with accepting these temporary ceremonies in return for an injury offered nor yet with monuments which are equally so—for some years afterward he permitted this pyramid to be destroyed—but he obliged the court of rome to restore castro and ronciglione to the duke of parma to indemnify the duke of modena for his claims on commachio and thus from an insult offered him he derived the solid honor of being the protector of the italian princes while he thus supported his dignity he forgot not to increase his power the good management of his finances under colbert enabled him to purchase dunkirk and mardyke of the king of england for five millions of livres at twentysix livres ten sous the mark charles ii who was a spendthrift and a beggar to his eternal disgrace sold this place which his subjects had purchased with their blood lordchancellor hyde who was accused of having advised or connived at this meanness was banished on oct         by the english parliament who frequently punish the crimes of favorites and sometimes even pass sentence upon its kings in      louis set thirty thousand men to work to fortify dunkirk both toward land and sea a large basin was dug between the town and the citadel capable of containing several men of war so that     the english had hardly sold this place when it became the object of their terror a short time afterward in      the king obliged the duke of lorraine to give him up the stronghold of marsal this unfortunate prince who though he had a reputation as a soldier was of a weak fickle and imprudent disposition and had lately made a treaty by which he gave the duchy of lorraine to france after his death on condition that the king should permit him to raise a million upon the territory and the princes of the bloodroyal of lorraine should take rank as princes of the blood of france this treaty which was in vain registered by the parliament of paris served only to produce new instances of levity on the side of the duke who in the end thought himself very happy to give up marsal and throw himself upon the kings clemency louis increased his dominions even in peace and always kept himself in readiness for war fortifying the frontier towns augmenting the number of his troops keeping them well disciplined and frequently reviewing them in person the turks were then a very formidable people in europe they attacked the emperor and the venetians at one and the same time it has been a maxim in politics with the kings of france ever since francis i to be in alliance with the turkish emperors not only on account of the advantage arising to their trade but for the sake of preventing the house of austria from becoming too powerful     however a christian king could not well refuse his assistance to the emperor when so hard pressed it was to the interest of france that the turks should raise disturbances in hungary but not that they should get possession of it and lastly the treaties in which louis was engaged with the empire made this step as indispensable as it was honorable to him louis then sent six thousand men into hungary under the command of the count of coligny the only remaining branch of the family of coligny formerly so famous in our civil wars and who perhaps deserves to be as much renowned as the admiral for his valor and virtuous qualifications he was strictly connected by friendship with the great condé and not all the offers of cardinal mazarin could ever make him fail in what he owed to his friend he was accompanied by the flower of the french nobility and among others by the young feuillade a man of enterprising disposition and unquenchable thirst for riches and glory these went together into hungary to serve under general montecuculi who was making head against the turkish vizier kiuperli and who afterward when he served against france counterbalanced the reputation of the great turenne a great battle was fought at saint gothard on the banks of the raab between the imperial and turkish armies in which the french performed such prodigies of valor that the germans themselves who were not fond of     them could not help doing them justice the germans however are not treated with the same justice by those writers who pretend to ascribe the honor of the victory wholly to the french the king while he thus settled his greatness in openly assisting the emperor and raising the glory of the french arms made a point of politics in secretly aiding the portuguese against the king of spain cardinal mazarin had solemnly given up the cause of portugal by the pyrenean treaty but the spanish court having been guilty of several little tacit infractions of that treaty the french in their turn made a more bold and decisive one marshal schomberg a foreigner and a huguenot was sent over to portugal with four thousand french soldiery who under pretence of being in the pay of the portuguese were in fact maintained by the french kings money these french troops in conjunction with a body of portuguese gained a complete victory over the spanish army at villa viciosa in june      by which the house of braganza was fixed on the throne of portugal louis now began to be looked upon as a warlike and politic prince and europe stood in dread of him even before he had declared war by the same policy he eluded the performance of the promises he had made to join the few ships he had at that time with the dutch fleet he had entered into an alliance with the statesgeneral in the year      about which time that republic had     renewed a war with england on the vain and idle subject of the honor of the flags and its real claim to a trade in the indies louis beheld with pleasure these two maritime powers sending fleets of a hundred sail every year to destroy each other by the most obstinate fights that had ever been known which only tended to the weakening of both sides one of these engagements lasted for three days and here it was that the dutch admiral de ruyter acquired the reputation of being the greatest seaman that had yet appeared this was the man who burned the finest ships the english nation had in their own harbors not above four leagues distant from london he made the dutch flag triumphant at sea where the english had hitherto always been the masters and where louis xiv was as yet nothing the empire of the sea was for some time divided between these two nations they were then the only people who rightly understood the art of building ships and employing them either for trade or war france during richelieus ministry thought herself powerful at sea because out of about threescore vessels which was then the whole of its marine it had about thirty fit to send to sea the largest of which mounted only seventy guns in mazarins administration they purchased what few ships they had from the dutch they were in want of sailors officers and manufactories both for building and fitting out ships the king with incredible diligence     set about repairing the ruined condition of the marine and to supply his kingdom with all it wanted but in      and      while the english and dutch covered the ocean with nearly three hundred sail of large men of war he had not above fifteen or sixteen and those of the smallest rates which were employed under the duke of beaufort against the barbary corsairs and when the statesgeneral pressed louis xiv to join his fleet to theirs there was only one fireship in brest harbor which it was shameful to send till upon their repeated remonstrances it was at last sent this was no small disgrace to the french nation but louis by his extraordinary vigilance speedily and effectually removed it but he furnished the states with much more essential and honorable assistance by land he sent six thousand french to defend them against the bishop of münster a prelate of a warlike disposition and implacable in his enmity who was paid by england to distress the dutch but louis made them pay dearly for this assistance and behaved toward them like a great man in power who sells his protection to a body of rich merchants colbert made them accountable not only for the pay of these troops but even for the charges of an embassy which was sent to england to conclude a peace for them with charles ii never was aid given with a worse grace nor accepted with less thankfulness the king having thus exercised his troops in   0 martial discipline formed a number of good officers by the campaigns in hungary holland and portugal and asserted the honor of his name and made it respected at rome beheld not a single potentate of whom he had occasion to stand in awe england visited by a plague which laid waste the whole kingdom and london reduced to ashes by a fatal conflagration which was falsely charged on the roman catholics the prodigality and continual indigence of charles ii which proved as fatal to his affairs as the scourges of pestilence and fire made france perfectly easy with respect to that nation the emperor had scarcely recovered the losses he had suffered in the war with the turk the spanish king philip iv being on the point of death and his kingdom in as weak a condition as himself louis xiv remained the only powerful and formidable sovereign in europe he was young rich well served blindly obeyed and impatient to signalize himself and to become a conqueror chapter vii the conquest of flanders the king was not long without an opportunity he so earnestly desired his fatherinlaw philip iv died this prince had by his first wife sister of louis xiii the princess maria theresa who was married to her cousin louis xiv by which match     the spanish monarchy fell at length into the house of bourbon which had been so long its enemy by his second marriage he had charles ii a weak and unhealthy child but who lived to inherit his fathers crown being the only surviving of three male children the other two having died in their infancy louis xiv pretended that flanders and franchecomté two provinces belonging to the kingdom of spain should by the laws of those provinces devolve to his wife notwithstanding her former renunciation were the causes of kings to be tried by the laws of nations before an impartial tribunal perhaps this affair might have appeared a little doubtful louis submitted his claims to the examination of his council and the body of theologians who declared them indisputable but the council and confessor of philip ivs widow thought them very ill founded this princess had a very powerful argument in her favor the express law made by charles v but charles vs laws were very little attended to by the court of france one of the pretexts made use of by the french kings council was that the five hundred thousand crowns which had been granted in dowry with his wife had never been paid but they had forgotten at the same time that the marriage portion of henry ivs daughter had likewise never been paid the two courts at first waged a paper war with each other in which the nicest calculations and most     learned arguments were displayed on both sides but reasons of state silenced all other pleas the king considering more in strength than arguments marched in person into flanders in      at the head of thirtyfive thousand men while another body of eight thousand was despatched toward dunkirk and a third consisting of four thousand to luxemburg turenne had the command of this army under his majesty colbert had multiplied the resources of the state to furnish the necessary expenses louvois the new secretary at war had made immense preparations for carrying on the campaign and magazines of all kinds were distributed over the frontiers he was the first who introduced the advantageous method of supplying the army by magazines which the weak condition of the government had hitherto rendered impracticable whatever place the king chose to lay siege to or whithersoever he turned his arms he was sure of finding supplies and subsistence ready the quarters for the troops were all fixed and their marches regulated the officers were all kept close to their duty by the strict discipline which this minister caused to be observed among them and the presence of a young monarch who was the idol of his army made the strictness of their duty light and even pleasing to them the military degree became a right more inviolably observed than even that of birth it was the mans services and not his family that was considered a thing which had     hitherto been rarely seen by this means an officer however inconsiderable in point of birth met with the encouragement due to his merit and those of the most exalted rank had no reason for complaint the infantry who sustained all the weight of the war since the disuse of lances shared with the cavalry in those rewards of which they had till then been in sole possession these new maxims in the government inspired everyone with a new kind of courage the king assisted by a general and minister of equal abilities both jealous of each other and striving who should best serve him at the head of the best troops in europe and newly engaged in an alliance with portugal with all those advantages attacks an illdefended province of a ruined and distracted kingdom he had only his motherinlaw philip ivs widow to deal with and she a weak woman whose unfortunate administration left her kingdom defenceless she had made her confessor one father nitard a german jesuit prime minister a man as fit for lording it over his penitent as he was unfit for governing a state having nothing of the minister or the churchman but haughtiness and ambition he had the insolence one day to say to the duke of lerma even before he came into the administration it is you who ought to show me respect since i have every day your god in my hands and your queen at my feet with all this insolence so contrary to true greatness of mind he     suffered the treasury to remain without money all the fortifications in the kingdom to go to ruin the harbors to be without shipping and the army without discipline destitute of generals badly paid and still worse commanded in presence of an enemy who possessed all the requisites which spain wanted the art of attacking places was not as perfect as it now is because that of fortifying and defending them was not so well known the frontiers of spanish flanders were almost destitute of fortifications and even garrisons louis then had nothing more to do than to present himself before them he entered charleroi as he would paris ath and tournay were taken in two days furnes armentières and courtrai made as little resistance the king entered the trenches before douay july        and the next morning it capitulated lille which was the finest town in that country and the only one well fortified having a garrison of six hundred men capitulated after nine days siege the spaniards had only eight thousand men to oppose a victorious army and even the rear guard of this small body was cut in pieces by the marquis afterward marshal de créqui the remainder hid itself within the walls of brussels and mons leaving louis to carry on his conquests without striking a blow this campaign which was made in the midst of abundance and had been attended with such easy successes seemed a party of pleasure made by a     court high living luxury and pleasures were then first introduced into our armies at the same time that the strictest discipline was established the officers performed military duty much more exactly than before but with every kind of convenience marshal turenne had for a long time been served only upon iron plates when in camp marquis dhumières was the first at the siege of arras in      who was served in plate in the trenches and had different courses at his table but in this campaign of      where a young monarch who was fond of magnificence held the most brilliant court amidst the fatigues of the field everyone prided himself in showing a taste for splendor elegant living dress and equipage this luxury the certain mark of riches in a great state and frequently the cause of ruin to a small one was nothing in comparison with what has been seen since the king his generals and ministers then went to the rendezvous of the army on horseback whereas now there is not a captain of horse nor the secretary of a general officer but has his postchaise hung on springs in which he travels with greater ease and convenience than in those days a person could make a visit from one part of paris to another this delicacy in the officers did not hinder them from going into the trenches with their steel caps and cuirasses the king himself set the example this prudent precaution preserved many a great man it has been too much neglected since by our     young people who are naturally tender and effeminate though courageous and who seem to dread fatigue more than danger the rapidity of the kings conquests filled brussels with alarm the inhabitants already began to remove their effects to antwerp all flanders might have been conquered in a single campaign the king only wanted a sufficient number of troops to put into those places which were ready to open their gates at his approach louvois advised him to put large garrisons into the conquered towns and to fortify them and vauban one of the many great men and surprising geniuses who appeared in this century for the service of louis xiv was appointed for this purpose he constructed the fortifications on a new method of his own which is now the standard for all good engineers it was a matter of surprise to see towns surrounded by walls which were almost on a level with the neighboring country the old lofty and menacing ramparts were only more exposed by their height to the force of the artillery but by making them sloping or shelving they were the less liable to this inconvenience he built the citadel of lille on these principles at that time—    —the government of a town and its citadel were among the french always vested in the same person but now an innovation was made in favor of vauban who was the first governor of a citadel and here we may observe that the first of those plans in relief which are to be seen in the     gallery of the louvre was that of the fortifications of lille the king now hastened back to paris to enjoy the acclamations of his people the adorations of his courtiers and mistresses and partake of the splendid entertainments which he gave to his court chapter viii conquest of franchecomté—peace of aixlachapelle the whole court was taken up with the diversions at st germain when in the midst of winter in the month of january everyone was surprised to see troops in motion on all sides and several bodies coming and going on the road to champagne in the three bishoprics several trains of battering cannon and wagons loaded with ammunition stopped under different pretences on the route which leads from champagne to burgundy this part of france was the scene of movements of which no one could conjecture the cause foreigners through interest and the courtiers through curiosity exhausted themselves in surmises germany was alarmed but everyone was alike ignorant of the object of these vast preparations and irregular marches never was more secrecy observed in a conspiracy than in this expedition of louis xiv at length on february   the king himself set out from st germain with the young duke of enghien and some of his     courtiers the other officers being at the place of rendezvous appointed for the troops he made long journeys on horseback and arrived at dijon twenty thousand men who had been assembled on different routes met the same day in franchecomté some leagues from besançon and the great condé appeared at their head having his friend boutevillemontmorency for his lieutenantgeneral lately made duke of luxembourg and who had always preserved an inviolable attachment to him through every change of his fortune luxembourg had studied the art of war under the great condé and his great merit obliged the king who did not love him to employ him the springs of this unforeseen expedition were these the prince of condé was jealous of turennes reputation and louvois of his favor with his master condés jealousy was that of a hero louvoiss that of a minister the prince who was governor of burgundy which borders on franchecomté had formed the project of making himself master of this province during the winter season in as short a time as turenne had taken in the foregoing summer to make the conquest of french flanders he immediately communicated his scheme to louvois who eagerly embraced it glad of an opportunity of removing turenne to a distance and making him useless and at the same time of serving his master this province which was then very poor but extremely well peopled is forty leagues long and     twenty broad it was called franchecomté—the free country—and was actually so for the spanish kings were rather its protectors than its masters and though this country was in the government of flanders yet it was very little dependent on it the administration was divided and disputed between the parliament and the governor of franchecomté the people enjoyed many privileges which the court of madrid were cautious of infringing on being desirous to keep fair with a province that was jealous of its rights and so near a neighbor to france never did people live under a milder government or were more attached to their sovereigns they had preserved an affection for the house of austria for almost two generations but this was rather the love of their liberty in a word franchecomté was happy though poor but as it was a kind of republic there were necessarily some factions among its inhabitants and notwithstanding what is said by pellisson louis did not confine himself merely to force on this occasion he began by gaining over some of the inhabitants by presents and promises he made sure of the abbot john watteville brother of him who having insulted the french ambassador at a public entry into london had by this outrage occasioned the humiliation of the spanish branch of the house of austria this abbot who had formerly been an officer then a carthusian friar afterward a turk and last of all a churchman had the promise of being made high   0 dean and of having several other preferments in the church the count of st amour the governors nephew was likewise bribed and the governor himself at last proved not inflexible a number of the counsellors of the parliament were bought at a reasonable rate and these private intrigues were at their very beginning seconded by an army of twenty thousand men besançon the capital of the province was invested by the prince of condé luxembourg marched to salins and the next day besançon and salins surrendered besançon insisted on no other terms of capitulation than that it should remain in possession of the holy handkerchief which was held in great reverence in that city and which was readily granted them the king having arrived at dijon louvois who had hastened to the frontiers to direct all the marches informed him that these two towns were besieged and taken the king hastened to show himself to fortune who did everything for him in person he next laid siege to dôle a place reputed very strong in which the count of montrevel commanded a man of distinguished valor who was faithful to the spanish government which he hated and a parliament which he despised his garrison consisted of no more than four hundred soldiers and the inhabitants of the place and yet he bravely resolved to defend it the trenches were not carried on in form for no sooner were they opened than a crowd of young volunteers who had followed the king flew to attack the counterscarp     on which they made a lodgment the prince of condé whose age and experience gave him a more sedate courage supported them properly and by sharing in their danger extricated them from it this prince was everywhere with his son and went to give an account of all that passed to the king as if he had been an officer who had his fortune to make the king remained in his quarters where he displayed the dignity of a monarch in his court rather than that impetuous ardor which is by no means necessary the same ceremonials were observed there as at st germain he had his great couch and his lesser one he had his drawingrooms his public audiencehall in his tent and never stooped from the dignity of the throne in any other respect than that of permitting his general officers and aidesdecamp to dine at the same table with him he never was seen to expose himself to the ruder fatigues of war nor to show that rash courage for which francis i and henry iv were so famous who greedily sought after danger in all shapes he was contented with not fearing it himself and with encouraging all about him to rush into it with ardor for his service he entered dôle after four days siege and twelve days after his departure from st germain and in less than three weeks the whole province of franchecomté was reduced the spanish council both amazed and incensed at the small resistance which had been made wrote the governor that the french king should have     sent his valets to take possession of the province instead of marching against it in person so much ambition and good fortune roused europe from its lethargy the empire began to stir and the emperor to raise troops the swiss nation who are neighbors to the people of franchecomté and who have nothing to depend upon but their liberty trembled for themselves the rest of flanders might be invaded the ensuing spring the dutch whose interest it had always been to have the french their friends shuddered at the thoughts of having them for neighbors spain had then recourse for protection and actually received it from that inconsiderable nation which it had hitherto looked upon as a contemptible and rebellious people holland was then governed by john de witt who had been chosen grand pensionary when he was only twentyfive years old a man who had the freedom of his country as much at heart as his own personal greatness wedded to the old republican principles frugality and moderation he kept only one man and a maid and always went on foot at the hague while in the negotiations of europe his name was ranked with that of the most powerful kings he was a person of unwearied application of the greatest regularity prudence and assiduity in public affairs an excellent citizen a great politician and yet in the end very unfortunate he had contracted a friendship with sir william temple the english ambassador at the hague     which is rarely to be found between statesmen sir william was a philosopher who blended a taste for literature with public affairs and an honest man notwithstanding that bishop burnet has reproached him with atheism he was born with a prudent republican genius and loved holland like his own country because it was the seat of liberty of which he was as jealous as the grand pensionary himself these two excellent members of the community joined with count dohna the swedish ambassador to stop the french kings progress this period was distinguished by rapid events french flanders had been taken within three months and franchecomté in the space of three weeks the treaty entered into between holland england and sweden for maintaining the balance of power in europe and bridling the ambition of louis xiv was proposed and concluded in five days the french monarch was not a little incensed that a pitiful state like that of holland should have presumed to think of setting bounds to his conquests and being the arbiter between crowned heads and still more so that it was in a condition to do it he was sensibly affected by this indignity put upon his greatness by the dutch which he was obliged to swallow for the present but for which he from that instant meditated revenge ambitious powerful and incensed as he was he yet found it most prudent to divert the storm which began to gather from all parts of europe he himself     made the first overtures for peace aixlachapelle was selected by the courts of france and spain for the place of conference and pope clement ix was chosen mediator the court of rome to cover its weakness with a show of credit earnestly contended for the honor of being the arbiter between crowned heads it had been disappointed at the peace of the pyrenees but it seemed to have carried its point at this of aixlachapelle a nuncio was sent to the congress to be a phantom of an arbiter between phantoms of plenipotentiaries the dutch who already felt a thirst for honor would not share that of concluding what they had begun with any other accordingly everything was in fact settled at st germain by their ambassador van beuning what had been privately agreed upon there with him was sent to aixlachapelle to be signed in great pomp by the ministers assembled at the congress who could have supposed thirty years before that a burgher of holland would oblige the kings of france and spain to abide by his arbitration this van beuning who was burgomaster of amsterdam had all the vivacity of a frenchman with the pride of a spaniard he took pleasure in thwarting the kings imperious disposition on all occasions and opposed a republican inflexibility to the magisterial tone which the french ministers began to assume do you doubt the kings word said m de lionne to him one day at a conference     i know not what the king may intend said van beuning i only consider what he may do in short at the court of the proudest monarch in the world a simple burgomaster concluded by his own authority a peace by which the king was obliged to restore franchecomté the dutch would have been much better pleased had he restored flanders by which they would have been freed from so formidable a neighbor but all europe thought the king showed sufficient moderation in parting with franchecomté however he was a greater gainer by keeping the towns in flanders as by this means he opened himself a way into holland whose destruction he meditated even while he appeared to make the greatest concessions chapter ix magnificence of louis xiv—conquest of holland louis xiv being obliged to remain peaceable for some time continued as he had begun to regulate fortify and embellish his kingdom his example showed that an absolute prince who has good intentions can compass the greatest things without difficulty he had only to command and the successes in the administration were no less rapid than his conquests had been it was a thing truly wonderful to see the seaports which were in a manner desolate and in ruins now surrounded with works which     served at once for their ornament and defence full of shipping and seamen and containing upward of sixty large vessels which might occasionally be fitted for war new colonies were every day sailing from all the ports in the kingdom under the protection of the french flag for america the east indies and the coast of barbary at the same time thousands of hands were employed at home under the kings eye in raising immense edifices and in all the arts which architecture introduces while those of the more noble and ingenious kind embellished the court and capital and diffused a degree of delight and fame over the kingdom of which the preceding age had not even an idea literature flourished and good taste and sound reasoning made their way into the schools of error and barbarism but a more circumstantial account of these things which made the happiness and glory of france will be found in their proper place in this work at present we must confine ourselves to general and military affairs at this period portugal exhibited a strange spectacle to the rest of europe don alphonso the unworthy son of the fortunate don john of braganza reigned in that kingdom he was a weak and hotheaded man his wife a daughter of the duke of nemours had conceived a passion for his brother don pedro and had the boldness to form a design of dethroning her husband and marrying the man she loved the brutality of her husband in some     measure justified this bold attempt of the queens alphonso was of a more than common bodily strength he had had a child by a courtesan whom he publicly acknowledged for his own he had for a long time cohabited with his wife and yet notwithstanding all this she accused him of impotence and having by her dexterous management acquired that authority in the kingdom which her husband had lost by his mad frenzy she shut him up in a prison and obtained a dispensation from the pope to marry her brotherinlaw it is not in the least surprising that the court of rome should grant these dispensations but it is extraordinary that those who have the power in their own hands should stand in need of them this event which affected only the royal family and caused no revolution in the kingdom of portugal nor produced any change in the affairs of europe merits our attention only on account of its singularity france soon afterward gave asylum to a king who descended from the throne in another manner this was john casimir king of poland who renewed the example of queen christina tired by the fatigues of government and desiring to live happily he chose paris for the place of his retreat and retired to the abbey of st germain of which he was abbot paris which had for some years past been the abode of all the arts afforded a delightful residence for a prince who sought the enjoyment of social pleasures and was a lover of learning he     had been a jesuit and a cardinal before he was king and now equally disgusted with the regal and ecclesiastical state was only desirous of living as a private person and a philosopher and would never suffer the title of majesty to be given him at paris but an affair of a more interesting nature took up the attention of all the christian potentates the turks who though not so formidable as under their mahomets their selims and their solymans were still dangerous and strengthened by our divisions had been laying siege to the island of candia for over two years with all the forces of the empire we can hardly say whether it was more astonishing that the venetians made so long a defence or that the princes of europe should have abandoned them times were greatly changed formerly when christendom was in a barbarous state a pope or even a monk could send forth millions of christians to make war upon the mahometans in their own empire our dominions were stripped of men and money to make the conquest of the wretched and barren province of judæa and now that the island of candia deemed the bulwark of christendom was overrun by sixty thousand turks the christian kings looked on with indifference while it was lost a few galleys sent by the maltese and the pope were the only reinforcements this republic received to defend itself against the whole ottoman empire the senate of venice with all its prudence was     unable with such weak aid to withstand the grand vizier kiuperli who was an able minister a still more able general and master of the turkish empire assisted by a formidable army and even provided with good engineers louis vainly attempted to set the other princes of europe an example in assisting candia the galleys and ships of war which he had newly built in the port of toulon transported thither seven thousand men under the command of the duke of beaufort but this assistance proved too weak in this dangerous juncture no other court choosing to imitate the generosity of france a private french gentleman named la feuillade did an action on this occasion which had no example but in the old times of chivalry he carried nearly three hundred gentlemen over to candia at his own expense though he had but a moderate fortune if any other nation had assisted the venetians in the same proportion with la feuillade it is more than probable that the island might have been saved these reinforcements however only served to retard its fall for some days and to spill a great deal of blood to no purpose the duke of beaufort was killed in a sally and the city reduced to a heap of ashes capitulated on sept         at this siege the turks had showed themselves superior even to the christians in the knowledge of the military art the largest cannon which had hitherto been seen in europe were cast in their   0 camp they were the first who drew parallel lines in the trenches it is from them that we learned this custom but they were indebted for it to an italian engineer it is certain that a victorious people such as the turks were with their experience courage riches and that unwearied perseverance which was their distinguishing characteristic might have conquered italy and made themselves masters of rome in a very little time but the dastardly emperors they have since had their bad generals and their faulty administration have preserved christendom the king little affected with these distant events waited only for the ripening of his grand project of conquering all the netherlands and beginning by holland the opportunity became every day more favorable this little republic was mistress of the seas but by land nothing could be more weak in alliance with england and spain and at peace with france she placed too much security in treaties and the advantages accruing from an immense trade and with a welldisciplined and invincible naval power her land forces were as badly provided and contemptible the cavalry was composed only of burghers who never stirred out of their houses and paid the dregs of the people to do duty in their stead the infantry was nearly upon the same footing commissions in the army and even the command of garrison towns were given to children or to the relations of burgomasters brought up in idleness and inexperience who considered their posts in     the same light as priests do their benefices the pensionary john de witt endeavored to reform this abuse but he did not endeavor sufficiently and this was one of the great faults of this famous republican in order to facilitate louiss scheme it was previously necessary to detach england from its alliance with the dutch whose ruin seemed inevitably to follow upon their being deprived of this support the king found it no difficult matter to persuade charles ii to concur in his designs this monarch was not much affected by the disgrace thrown upon his reign and the english nation when his ships were burned in the river thames by the dutch fleet he entertained no thoughts of revenge or conquest he was desirous of enjoying a life of pleasure and reigning as much as possible without control this was his weak side accordingly louis who had only to speak the word and be supplied with what money he had occasion for promised charles a very considerable sum who was not able to raise any himself without the concurrence of his parliament this secret alliance between the two kings which was formed in    0 was known to no one in france but to the kings sisterinlaw to louvois and turenne a young princess then who was only twentyfive years of age was the plenipotentiary pitched upon to put the finishing hand to this treaty with charles a visit which the king was to make to his new conquests of dunkirk and lille served as a pretence for     his sisterinlaws journey over to england the pomp and grandeur of the ancient kings of asia were nothing in comparison with the magnificence of this excursion the king was always preceded or followed by thirty thousand men while on the road some of whom were destined to reinforce the garrisons of the conquered countries others to work at the fortifications and the rest to level the roads his majesty was also accompanied by the queen his consort all the princesses of the blood and the most beautiful ladies of his court among whom his sisterinlaw shone with a superior lustre and secretly enjoyed the glory and satisfaction of all this parade which was wholly on her account it was one continual feast from st germain to lille the king willing to gain the hearts of his new subjects and to dazzle the eyes of the neighboring states distributed his liberalities wherever he came to a degree of profusion the most magnificent presents were lavished on everyone who had the least pretext for speaking to him princess henrietta embarked at calais to pay a visit to her brother who had already come as far as canterbury to receive her charles blinded by the love he bore his sister and the great sums promised him from france signed everything that louis xiv desired and laid a foundation for the ruin of holland in the midst of feastings and diversions the loss of the duchess of orleans who died in a sudden and shocking manner immediately upon     her return from england drew great suspicions upon the duke of orleans her husband but made no alteration in what had been resolved upon between the two kings the spoils of the republic they had devoted to destruction were already shared by the secret treaty between them in the same manner as flanders had been shared between the dutch and the french in      thus states frequently change their views their alliances and their enmities and are not unfrequently disappointed in all their projects the rumor of this approaching expedition began to spread abroad but europe listened to it without being stirred the emperor taken up with seditions in hungary the swede lulled asleep by negotiations and the spanish monarchy still weak and ever irresolute and slow in its determinations left louis xiv to follow the career of his ambition uninterrupted to complete its misfortune holland was at that time divided into two factions the one composed of rigid republicans to whom the least shadow of absolute authority seemed a monster contrary to the laws of human society the other of republicans of a more moderate disposition who were desirous of investing the young prince of orange afterward the famous william iii with the posts and dignities of his ancestors the grand pensionary john de witt and his brother cornelius were at the head of the rigid sticklers for liberty but the young princes party began to gain ground the republic was more attentive to its domestic dissensions than to the     danger which threatened it from without and thus contributed to its own ruin louis not only purchased the king of england but he brought over the elector of cologne and the famous van galen bishop of münster who was greedy for war and plunder and was naturally an enemy to the dutch louis had formerly assisted them against the bishop and now joined with him for their destruction the swedes who had joined with the republic in      to check the progress of a conqueror who had then no designs against them abandoned her as soon as they saw her threatened with ruin and renewed their old connections with france on condition of receiving the former subsidies it is somewhat singular and worthy of remark that of all the enemies who were about to fall upon this petty state there was not one that could allege a lawful pretext for entering into the war this was much such an undertaking as the league between louis xii the emperor maximilian and the king of spain who entered into a covenant to destroy the republic of venice only for being rich and haughty the statesgeneral in the utmost consternation wrote to the king beseeching him in the humblest manner to let them know if the great preparations he was making were really destined against them his ancient friends and faithful allies they asked how they had offended him or what satisfaction he required to these remonstrances he returned the     answer that he should employ his troops in such manner as became his dignity for which he should be accountable to no one all the reasons his ministers could give were that the writer of the dutch gazette had been too insolent and that van beuning was said to have caused a medal to be struck reflecting upon the honor of louis xiv van beunings christian name was joshua a taste for devices prevailed at that time in france louis xiv had taken a sun for his with this legend nec pluribus impar now it was pretended that van beuning in the medal in question which however never had existence was represented with a sun and these words for the motto in conspectu meo stetit sol at sight of me the sun stood still it is certain that the statesgeneral had ordered a medal to be struck expressing all the glorious deeds of the republic in the following legend assertis legibus emendatis sacris adjutis defensis conciliatis regibus vindicata marium libertate stabilita oribis europæ quiete the laws asserted religion amended princes succored defended and reconciled the freedom of the ocean vindicated and peace restored to europe in all this they boasted of nothing more than they had done and yet they ordered the mould of this medal to be destroyed in order to appease louiss anger the king of england on his side pretended that their fleet denied the honors due to the english flag by refusing to lower their topsails to an english     pleasureboat and complained of a certain picture in which cornelius de witt the pensionarys brother was painted with the ensigns of a conqueror on the background the painter had exhibited a representation of ships on fire the truth is that cornelius de witt who bore a considerable share in the maritime exploits against england had indulged himself in this trifling monument of his fame but the picture itself was in a manner unknown and hung in a room where hardly anyone ever entered the english ministers who had transmitted their masters pretended grievances in writing to the statesgeneral made mention of certain abusive pictures now the dutch who always translate the memorials of foreign ministers into french had rendered the term abusive by the french word fautis trompeurs false or lying pictures upon which they answered that they did not know what was meant by lying pictures in short they never once conceived that it related to this portrait of their fellowcitizen nor could they imagine this to be a pretext for the war all that the efforts of ambition and human foresight could devise for the destruction of a nation was put in practice by louis xiv the history of mankind hardly furnishes us with an instance of such formidable preparations being made for so small an expedition of all the different conquerors that have invaded a part of the world not one ever began the career of conquest with so many regular     troops and so much money as louis employed in subduing the petty state of the united provinces no less than fifty millions which were worth ninetyseven millions of our present currency were expended in these pompous preparations thirty men of war of fifty guns each joined the english fleet consisting of a hundred sail the king accompanied by his brother the duke of orleans marched at the head of one hundred and twelve thousand men toward maestricht and charleroi on the frontiers of spanish flanders and holland the bishop of münster and the elector of cologne had about twenty thousand more prince condé and marshal turenne were the generals of the kings army and the duke of luxembourg commanded under them vauban had the direction of the sieges louvois was present in all places with his customary vigilance never was there an army so magnificent and at the same time so well disciplined but the kings household troops which were newly reformed made a most glorious spectacle they consisted of four companies of gardes du corps or bodyguards each company composed of three hundred gentlemen among whom were a considerable number of young cadets who served without pay but were equally subject to strict military discipline with the rest two hundred gendarmes of the guard two hundred light horse five hundred musketeers three hundred chosen gentlemen remarkable for their youth and handsome appearance twelve companies of gendarmerie     since augmented to the number of sixteen even the hundred swiss regiment accompanied the king on this occasion and the royal regiment of french and swiss guards mounted before the house where he took up his residence or at the door of his tent these troops the greater part of whom were covered with gold and silver were at once the object of terror and admiration to a people who were strangers to all kinds of magnificence and the exact discipline which was kept up in this army made it appear in a different light from any that had yet been seen there were at that time no inspectors of the horse and foot as there have since been but these offices were performed by two men who were singular in their way martinet put the infantry upon the footing of discipline in which we now see it and the chevalier de fourilles did the same by the cavalry martinet had a year before introduced the use of the bayonet among some of the regiments before him it had never been made use of in a constant or uniform manner this last effort of what perhaps is the most terrible of the whole military art was already known but had been little practised because spears were still much in use this same officer likewise invented copper boats for bridges which might easily be transported in wagons or on horseback the king confident of success and glory from all these advantages carried along with him a historian to write his conquests this was pellisson of whom mention will be made in     the article of polite arts a person whose talent lay more in good writing than avoiding flattery against the great condé turenne luxembourg vauban an army of one hundred and thirty thousand men an incredible train of artillery and immense sums of money to bribe the fidelity of those who commanded garrison towns what had the republic of holland to oppose a young prince of weak constitution who had never seen a battle or a siege and about twentyfive thousand bad soldiers which were all the strength of the country william prince of orange who was about twentytwo years old had lately been elected captaingeneral of the land forces in spite of the opposition of john de witt who could no longer withstand the wishes of the nation this prince under the dutch phlegm concealed an ardent ambition and love of glory which ever afterward manifested itself in his conduct without ever appearing in his discourse he was of a cold and sour disposition but of an active and penetrating genius his courage which never abandoned him supported his feeble and languid body under fatigues which seemed above his strength he was valiant without ostentation ambitious without being fond of vainglory and endowed by nature with a phlegmatic obstinacy formed for combating adversity he delighted in war and politics and was equally a stranger to the joys of society or the pleasures attendant upon greatness in a   0 word he was in almost every respect the direct opposite to louis xiv he was at first unable to stem the torrent which overflowed his country his forces were but inconsiderable and even his authority was greatly limited by the states the whole power of france was ready to fall upon a republic which had nothing to defend it the imprudent duke of lorraine who endeavored to raise troops in order to join his fortune with that of the republic had just beheld his country seized upon by the french troops with as much facility as they can seize upon avignon on any quarrel with the papal see in the meantime the king caused his armies to advance on the side of the rhine into those countries which border upon holland cologne and flanders he ordered money to be distributed among the inhabitants of all the villages which were likely to suffer from the march of his troops through them if a private gentleman made the least complaint to him he was sure of being dismissed with a present an envoy being sent from the governor of the netherlands to make a representation of some disorders committed by the soldiers the king with his own hand presented him with his picture richly set in diamonds and valued at over twelve thousand francs this behavior attracted the admiration of the people and made them stand more in awe of his power the king was at the head of his household and     a body of his choicest troops in all amounting to thirty thousand men turenne had the command under him prince condé was likewise at the head of as strong an army the other corps commanded alternately by luxembourg and chamilly occasionally formed separate armies which could all join one another in case of necessity the campaign was opened by the siege of four towns at once rheinberg orsoi wesel and borbeck names which merit a place in this history only on account of the event these were taken almost as soon as they were invested rheinberg which the king thought proper to besiege in person did not stand a single attack and in order to make more sure of its reduction means had been found to corrupt the lieutenant of the garrison one dosseri an irishman who after having been base enough to sell his trust was so imprudent as to retire to maestricht where the prince of orange punished his treachery with death all the strongholds on the yssel capitulated some of the garrisons sent the keys of their town as soon as they perceived two or three squadrons of the french appear in sight several officers fled from the towns where they were in garrison even before the enemy had entered their territories in short the consternation was general the prince of orange had not a sufficient force to take the field all holland prepared to submit to the yoke as soon as the king should cross the rhine the prince of orange     caused lines to be drawn with the utmost haste on the other side the river and even after he had done this he was sensible how impossible it was for him to defend them nothing now remained but to discover if possible in what part the french intended to throw over a bridge in order to oppose their passage in fact it was the kings intention to pass the river on a bridge of those little copper boats invented by martinet at that time the prince of condé had received information from some of the country people that the dryness of the season had formed a ford on a branch of the rhine near an old castle which served as an office for the tollgatherers and was called toll huis or the tollhouse the king ordered this ford to be sounded according to pellisson who was an eyewitness of the whole there was not above forty or fifty paces to swim over in the midst of this arm of the river this was in fact nothing for a number of horses abreast entirely broke the current of the water which was of itself very weak the landing on the opposite side was very easy as it was defended only by four or five hundred horsemen and two weak regiments of foot without any cannon the french artillery played upon those in flank while the household troops and some of the best of the cavalry crossed the river without any hazard to the number of fifteen thousand men condé crossed at the same time in one of the copper boats some few dutch officers who at first made a show of advancing     into the water in order to oppose their landing took to their heels the instant the french troops drew near to the shore unable to stand before the multitude which came pouring on them the foot immediately laid down their arms and called for quarter this passage was effected with the loss of only a few drunken horsemen who had swum out of their depth and there would not have been a single life lost that day—june        —had it not been for the imprudence of the young duke of longueville who being it is said overheated with wine fired his pistol at some of the enemys people who had laid down their arms and were begging their lives crying out give the scoundrels no quarter and drawing his trigger shot an officer dead upon this the dutch infantry in a fit of despair instantly flew to their arms and made a general discharge by which the duke of longueville himself was killed a captain of their horse named ossembrouk who had not fled with the rest rode up to the prince of condé who had just reached shore and was going to mount his horse and pointed his pistol at his head the prince by a sudden motion of his body turned aside the piece and received only a wound in his wrist which was the first wound he had ever received in all his campaigns the french immediately fell upon the small body sword in hand who began to fly on all sides in the meantime the king crossed the river with the rest of the army on a bridge of boats     such was the passage of the rhine an action which made a great noise was singular in its kind and was celebrated at that time as one of those great events which ought to occupy the memory of mankind the air of greatness with which the king performed all his actions the rapid success of his victories the glory of his reign the adulation of his courtiers and lastly the fondness which the common people especially those of paris have in general for everything that appears extraordinary or else that ignorance of military operations which prevails among those who pass a life of idleness in great cities made this passage of the rhine appear a prodigy it was the common opinion that the whole army swam across the river in presence of the enemy intrenched on the opposite side and in defiance of the fire from an impregnable fortress called the tollhouse it is a certain truth that the enemy themselves were greatly imposed upon in this affair and that if they had had a body of good troops on the other side of the river the attempt would have been extremely dangerous as soon as the french army had passed the rhine it took doesborgh zütphen arnheim nosembourg nimeguen skenk bommel and crèvecœur and there was hardly an hour in the day in which the king did not receive the news of some fresh conquest an officer named mazel sent turenne word that if he would send him fifty horse he would engage to make himself master of two or three places     the inhabitants of utrecht sent the keys of their city to the conqueror and it capitulated together with the whole province which bears its name louis made his entry into this city in triumph on june  0      accompanied by his highalmoner his confessor and the titular bishop of utrecht the high church was with great solemnity delivered up to the catholics and the bishop of utrecht who had hitherto only held the empty title was now for a little time put in possession of the real dignity the provinces of utrecht overyssel and guelders were actually reduced and amsterdam only waited the hour of its slavery or destruction the jews settled there made interest with gourville the prince of condés confidant and chief manager of his affairs to accept two millions of florins to save them from being plundered naarden which is in the neighborhood of amsterdam was already taken four horsemen who were on a marauding party advanced to the very gates of muiden which is not above a mile from amsterdam and where are the sluices by which the country may be laid under water the magistrates struck with a panic at the sight of these four soldiers came out and offered them the keys of the town but at length perceiving that no other troops came up they took back the keys and shut the gates again a moments more diligence would have put amsterdam into the kings hands this capital once taken not only the republic itself must have fallen but     there would no longer have been such a republic as holland and even the country itself would have been annihilated some of the richest families and those who were most zealous lovers of liberty were preparing to fly to the extremity of the globe and embark for batavia there was actually a list made out of the shipping fit for undertaking this voyage and a calculation of the numbers they would carry when it was found that fifty thousand families might be thus transported into their new country holland then would have existed only in the east indies its provinces in europe who purchase their corn wholly with the riches they import from asia who subsist wholly upon their commerce and their liberty if i may use that expression would have been almost in an instant depopulated and ruined amsterdam the staple and warehouse of europe where three hundred thousand souls are daily employed in cultivating arts and trade would have become one vast marsh all the lands round about require an immense expense and thousands of men to raise their dikes those would in all probability have been stripped at once of their inhabitants and riches and at length buried under water the distresses of the state were still further increased by the divisions which commonly arise among unfortunate people who impute to one another the public calamities the grand pensionary john de witt thought there was no other way left to save what remained of his wretched country but     by suing to the victors for peace full of a republican spirit and jealous of his personal authority he dreaded the aggrandizement of the house of orange still more than the conquests of the french king on this account he had obliged the prince of orange himself to swear to the observance of a perpetual edict by which he the prince was excluded from the stadtholdership honor authority party spirit and interest all combined to make de witt a strenuous asserter of this oath and he chose rather to see his country subdued by a victorious king than under subjection to a stadtholder the prince of orange on his side who had more ambition than de witt was as much attached to his country more patient under public calamities and expecting everything from time and his own unshaken constancy tried all means to obtain the stadtholdership and opposed a peace with as much vehemence as de witt promoted it the states however resolved to sue for peace in spite of the prince but the prince was raised to the stadtholdership in spite of de witt in      four deputies arrived in the kings camp to implore mercy in the name of a republic which six months before looked upon itself as the arbiter of kings louiss ministers did not receive the deputies with that french politeness which blends the mildness of civility with the severity of government louvois who was of a haughty and arrogant disposition and seemed better suited to serve his master     well than to make him beloved received the suppliants in a disdainful manner and even with insulting raillery they were obliged to go back and forth several times before the king would deign to make his will known to them at length they were told that his majesty decreed that the statesgeneral should give up all the places they were in possession of on the other side of the rhine with nimeguen and several other towns and forts in the heart of their country that they should pay him twenty millions of livres that the french should be masters of transporting merchandise on all the principal roads in holland both by land and water without ever paying any duty that the roman catholic religion should be everywhere established that the republic should send an extraordinary embassy to the french court every year together with a golden medal on which should be engraved a legend importing that they held their freedom of louis xiv lastly that they should make satisfaction to the king of england the elector of cologne and the bishop of münster who had joined in the desolation of their country a peace on these conditions which were little better than articles of slavery appeared insupportable the haughtiness of the conqueror inspired the vanquished with a desperate courage and it was unanimously resolved to die fighting the hearts and hopes of everyone were now fixed upon the prince of orange the populace grew furious against the     grand pensionary who had asked for peace the prince by his politics and his party by their animosity increased the ferment an attempt was made upon the grand pensionarys life and afterward his brother cornelius was accused of a design to murder the prince and was put to the rack in the midst of his tortures he repeated the beginning of this ode of horace justum  tenacem propositi virum which perfectly well suited with his condition and courage and which may be thus translated for the sake of those who do not understand latin   the man in conscious virtue bold   who dares his secret purpose hold   unshaken hears the crowds tumultuous cries   and the impetuous tyrants angry brow defies   let the loud winds that rule the seas   tempestuous their wild horrors raise   let joves dread arm with thunders rend the spheres   beneath the crush of worlds undaunted he appears on aug  0      the two brothers were massacred at the hague by the mad multitude after one of them had governed the state for over nineteen years with the most unspotted integrity and the other had defended it at the hazard of his life the most shocking cruelties that could enter into the imagination of a furious populace were exercised upon their dead bodies these barbarities are common in all nations the french themselves had exercised them upon marshal dancre admiral coligny and others for the populace is almost everywhere the same they wreaked their revenge on all the   0 pensionarys friends even de ruyter himself the republics admiral and who was the only one who fought her battles with success had his house at amsterdam surrounded by assassins in the midst of this disorder and desolation the magistrates gave an example of integrity rarely found in republics those private persons who were possessed of bank notes ran in crowds to the bank of amsterdam apprehending that the public stock had been broken in upon everyone was for being paid with the little money supposed to be left the magistrates immediately ordered the vaults to be opened when it was found entire as it had been deposited there for more than sixty years the money was still black and discolored with the fire which had burned down the townhouse several years before the bank notes had been negotiated till that time and the money had never been touched everyone that chose to receive it was then paid with this money in lieu of notes so much integrity and so powerful a resource were at that time the more admirable as charles ii of england not satisfied with the money he had received from france and wanting a further supply to carry on his war against the dutch and answer the expense of his pleasures had lately turned bankrupt if it was shameful in this monarch thus to violate public faith it was no less glorious in the magistrates of amsterdam to preserve it at a time when they might have had a plausible excuse for failure     to this republican virtue they added that courageous spirit which resorts to the utmost extremities in irremediable evils they ordered the dikes which kept out the sea to be thrown down the country seats which are in prodigious numbers about amsterdam the villages and the neighboring cities of leyden and delft were in an instant laid under water the peasant beheld his flocks drowned in the pastures without once murmuring amsterdam stood like a vast fortress in the midst of the waves encircled by ships of war which had water enough to ride all around the city the people suffered great want they were particularly distressed for fresh water which sold for six sous a pint but these extremities seemed less grievous than slavery it is a thing worthy of observation that holland thus distressed by land and no longer a state still retained its power at sea which was this nations true element while louis xiv was crossing the rhine and reducing these provinces the dutch admiral de ruyter with a hundred sail of men of war and fifty fireships sailed for the english coast in quest of the combined fleets of the two sovereigns who notwithstanding they had united their forces by sea were not able to fit out a naval armament superior to that of the dutch the english and dutch fought like people accustomed to dispute the empire of the sea with each other this battle which was fought on june        near solebay lasted a whole day de     ruyter who gave the signal for beginning the engagement attacked the english admirals ship in which was the duke of york the kings brother de ruyter gained all the glory of this single combat the duke of york was obliged to go on board another ship and never faced the dutch admiral afterward the french squadron consisting of thirty ships had little share in this action and so decisive was the fortune of this day that it put the coast of holland out of danger after this battle de ruyter notwithstanding the fears and contradictions of his countrymen conveyed the fleet from the east indies safe to texel thus defending and enriching his country on one side while she was falling overwhelmed with ruin on the other the dutch even kept up their trade and no colors but theirs were to be seen in the indian seas one day the french consul told the king of persia that his master louis xiv had conquered almost all holland how can that be replied the monarch when there are now in the port of ormus twenty dutch ships for one french the prince of orange however had the ambition of being a good citizen he made an offer to the state of the revenues of his posts and of all his private fortune toward the support of the common cause he overflowed all the passes by which the french could penetrate into the rest of the country by his prompt and secret negotiations he raised the emperor the empire the spanish council and the     government of flanders from their lethargy he even disposed the english court to listen to peace in a word louis had entered holland in may and by the month of july all europe was in confederacy against him monterey governor of flanders sent a few regiments privately to the assistance of the united provinces the emperor leopolds council likewise despatched montecuculi at the head of twenty thousand men and the elector of brandenburg took the field with twentyfive thousand troops whom he kept in his own pay the king now quitted his army as there were no more conquests to be made in a country that was overflowed it was even become difficult to keep the provinces which had been conquered louis desirous to secure the glory he had acquired contented himself with having taken such a number of towns in the space of two months and leaving turenne and luxembourg to finish the war he returned to st germain about the middle of the summer to enjoy his triumphs but while his subjects were everywhere erecting monuments of his conquests the powers of europe were at work to snatch them out of his hands     chapter x holland evacuated—franchécomte conquered a second time we think it necessary to advise those who may read this work that they are to remember it is not a bare relation of campaigns but rather a history of the manners of mankind there are already a sufficient number of books filled with the minute particulars of military actions and details of human rage and misery the design of this essay is to describe the principal characters of these revolutions and to remove the multitude of trifling facts in order to set to view those only which are considerable and the spirit by which they were actuated france was at that time in the zenith of her glory the names of her generals inspired veneration her ministers were regarded as geniuses superior to the counsellors of other princes and louis xiv seemed almost the only king in europe as to the emperor leopold he never appeared with his armies charles ii king of spain son of philip iv was as yet a child and the king of england showed no activity but in the pursuit of his pleasures the princes of europe and their ministers were all guilty of great blunders england acted against the common principles of reason in joining with france to aggrandize a power which it was to her interest to weaken     the emperor the empire and the king of spains council committed still a greater error in not opposing this torrent in the beginning and even louis himself was as blamable as any of them for not rapidly pursuing conquests which were so easily made condé and turenne were for demolishing the greatest part of the fortified places taken from the dutch alleging that states were not to be taken by garrisons but by armies and that keeping one or two strongholds only for a retreat they should proceed immediately to complete the conquest of the whole country louvois on the contrary was for making every place a garrison or fortress this was his peculiar genius and it was likewise the kings own taste louvois had by this means more employments in his disposal and increased his ministerial influence besides he took a pride in thwarting the two greatest captains of the age louis implicitly believed what he said by which he was deceived as he afterward acknowledged he let slip the opportunity of entering the capital of holland he weakened his army by dividing it into too many detachments and gave the enemy breathing time the history of the greatest princes is frequently a narrative of human errors after the king had quitted the army affairs took a different turn turenne was obliged to march into westphalia to oppose the imperialists monterey the governor of flanders whom the spanish council were afraid of countenancing openly reinforced     the prince of oranges small army with about ten thousand men by which the prince found himself strong enough to oppose the french till the winter it was doing a great deal to be able to hold fortune in suspense at length winter came on and covered the overflowed country of holland with ice luxembourg who commanded in utrecht carried on a new kind of war to which the french themselves were strangers and threw the dutch into a fresh dilemma as terrible as anything they had yet experienced one night he got together nearly twelve thousand foot soldiers drawn from the neighboring garrisons and having ordered every man to be furnished with a pair of skates he put himself at their head and began his march over the ice toward leyden and the hague a thaw came on which saved the hague and his little army surrounded by the waters knowing no longer which way to go and being destitute of provisions was on the point of perishing there was a narrow and muddy dike where four men could barely walk abreast which he was obliged to march over before he could get back to utrecht and there was no way to get at this dike but by attacking a fort which seemed impregnable without artillery and had those who were in it defended it but for a single day the french army must inevitably have perished with hunger and fatigue luxembourg now looked upon himself as lost but the same good fortune which had preserved the hague     saved his army through the cowardice of the commandant of the fort who abandoned his post without the least reason there are a thousand events in war as in civil life which are altogether incomprehensible and this was of the number this expedition was productive of nothing but a piece of cruelty which rendered the french name completely odious in this country bodegraven and swammerdam two considerable villages each well peopled and as large as some of our middling towns were given up to the soldiery for plunder as a reward for the fatigues they had undergone they immediately set fire to both towns and indulged themselves by the light of the flames in all the excesses of debauchery and cruelty it is surprising that the common soldiers among the french can be so barbarous seeing they are commanded by officers who have with justice the reputation of being as humane as they are brave the sacking of these two places was so exaggerated that i myself above forty years afterward saw some dutch books in which children were taught to read where this affair was recapitulated in order to inspire the rising generation with a hatred to the french in      the king cut out work for the cabinets of all europe by his negotiations he gained over the duke of hanover the elector of brandenburg in entering into the war had made a treaty which he soon broke there was not a court in germany where louis had not some pensioners by his     emissaries in hungary he fomented the troubles of that province which had been severely treated by the emperors council he lavished great sums on charles ii of england to engage him to declare war once more against the dutch notwithstanding the outcries and murmurs of all his subjects who were filled with indignation at being made tools to raise the french kings greatness which it was to their interest and desire to humble in a word louis disturbed all europe by his arms and negotiations but after all he could not prevent the emperor the empire and spain from joining the dutch and publicly declaring war against him he had so far changed the course of things that the dutch who were his natural allies were become friends to spain the emperor leopold sent aid slowly but he showed great animosity against the french it is reported that as he was going to eger to see the troops which were there assembled he took the sacrament on the road and that after having communicated he took a crucifix in his hand and called god to witness the justice of his cause this action would have done very well in the time of the crusades however the emperors invocation did not in the least stop the progress of the french kings arms it was soon apparent how greatly his marine was improved instead of thirty ships which had been sent the year before to join the english fleet he now sent forty without reckoning fireships the     officers had learned from the english the judicious manner of working their ships in their engagements with the dutch the duke of york afterward king james ii was the person who first invented the method of giving orders in a naval fight by the different dispositions and motions of flags till that time the french did not know how to draw up a fleet in line of battle all their experience consisted in fighting ship to ship without knowing how to make a number move in concert or to imitate at sea the evolutions of armies on shore whose several different corps mutually sustain and assist each other in this they resembled the romans who in one years time learned the art of fighting at sea from the carthaginians and soon became equal with their masters the viceadmiral destrées and his second in command martel did honor to the industry of the french nation in three successive engagements which were fought in june      between the dutch fleet and the combined squadrons of france and england admiral de ruyter was more admired than ever in these three engagements destrées in a letter to colbert expressed himself in these terms i would willingly have died to purchase the glory which de ruyter has acquired destrées deserved that ruyter should have said the same by him in short the valor and conduct were so equal on both sides that it remained doubtful which had the victory   0 louis having thus made seamen of his french subjects through the diligence of colbert improved the art of war on land by the industry of vauban he went in person to lay siege to maestricht at the time that these three naval battles were fought maestricht was the key of the low countries and the united provinces the place was prodigiously strong and defended by an intrepid governor named farjaux a frenchman by birth who had gone into the spanish service and afterward into the dutch the garrison consisted of five hundred men vauban who had the direction of the siege made use for the first time of the parallel lines which were invented by the italian engineers in the service of the turks at the siege of candia to these he added the places darmes or parade of arms which is made in the trenches for ranging the troops in order of battle and better rallying them in case of sallies from the besieged louis in this siege showed himself more strict and assiduous than he had ever yet done by his example he accustomed his subjects to endure labor patiently who had hitherto been regarded as a nation which had only an impetuous courage that is soon exhausted by fatigues maestricht surrendered june    after a weeks siege the desire of establishing strict military discipline among his troops carried him rather to an excess of severity the prince of orange at first had only a few officers without emulation and soldiers without courage to oppose the rapid conquests of the french     arms and therefore was obliged to employ the utmost rigor in training them and to hang everyone who quitted his post the king likewise made use of punishments naarden the first place he lost a very brave officer named du pas gave up to the prince of orange it is true he held out only four days but he did not give it up till after an obstinate engagement of five hours on bad works and to prevent a general assault which it would have been impossible for him to have sustained with a weak and dispirited garrison the king incensed at this first affront which his arms had received ordered du pas to be led through utrecht by the common hangman with a shovel in his hand and to have his sword broken before his face this ignominious treatment was perhaps not altogether necessary as the french officers have too nice a sense of honor to need being governed by the fear of disgrace it is to be observed that according to the tenor of his commission the governor of a fortress is obliged to stand three assaults but this is one of those laws which are hardly ever put in force but not all the kings diligence vaubans genius louvoiss strict vigilance the knowledge and great military experience of turenne nor the active intrepidity of the prince of condé were sufficient to repair the fault which had been committed in keeping such a number of places weakening the army and missing the opportunity of taking amsterdam     the prince of condé in vain attempted to penetrate into the heart of holland which was all under water turenne could neither prevent the junction of montecuculi with the prince of orange nor hinder the latter from making himself master of the town of bonn the bishop of münster who had sworn the destruction of the statesgeneral was himself attacked by them the english parliament obliged its king to enter seriously into a treaty of peace and to cease being the mercenary instrument of aggrandizing france and now the french were obliged to evacuate the three dutch provinces as rapidly as they had conquered them but not till they had made them pay dearly for their deliverance the intendant robert had raised in the single province of utrecht in one year no less than sixteen hundred and sixtyeight thousand florins so great was their hurry to evacuate the country which they had overrun with such rapidity that twentyeight thousand dutch prisoners were restored at a crown a man the triumphal arch of st deniss gate and the other monuments of louiss conquests were hardly finished when those conquests were already abandoned during the course of this invasion the dutch had the honor of disputing the empire of the sea and the dexterity to remove the theatre of the war out of their own country louis xiv was considered throughout europe as one who had enjoyed the glory of a transient triumph with too much precipitation and pride     the fruits of this expedition were that he had a bloody war to support against the united forces of the empire spain and holland saw himself abandoned by england and at length by the bishop of münster and even the elector of cologne and left the countries he had invaded and was compelled to quit more hated than admired the king maintained his ground alone against all the enemies he had drawn upon him the foresight of his administration and the strength of his kingdom appeared to much greater advantage when he had so many combined powers and great generals to defend himself against than even when he took french flanders in a party of pleasure and franchecomté and one half of holland from a defenceless enemy it now appeared how great an advantage an absolute sovereign whose finances are well managed has over all other kings he at one and the same time furnished turenne with an army of twentythree thousand men against the imperialists condé with one of forty thousand against the prince of orange and a body of troops was stationed on the borders of roussillon a fleet of transports full of soldiers was sent to carry the war among the spaniards even to the gates of messina while he himself marched in person to subdue franchecomté a second time in a word he at once defended himself and attacked his enemies on every side     as soon as louis began his expedition against franchecomté the superiority of his administration showed in the fullest manner it was necessary to bring over or at least to amuse the swiss nation who are as formidable as poor are always in arms jealous to an excess of their liberty invincible on their own frontiers and who already began to murmur and take umbrage at seeing louis a second time in their neighborhood the emperor and the court of spain warmly solicited the thirteen cantons to grant a free passage to their troops who were going to the assistance of franchecomté which had been left defenceless by the negligence of the spanish ministry but the emperor and the spaniard were only lavish in arguments and entreaties the french king on the contrary by a million of livres in ready money and the assurance of six hundred thousand more prevailed on those people to do as he pleased they refused to grant a passage to the spanish troops louis accompanied by his brother and the great condés son laid siege to besançon he was fond of this part of war which he understood perfectly well and left the care of the campaign to condé and turenne besides he never laid siege to a town without being morally sure of taking it louvois made such excellent preparations the troops were so well found in everything vauban who had almost always the direction of the sieges was so great a master in the art of reducing places that the king was secure     of his reputation vauban directed the attacks against besançon which was taken in nine days and at the end of six weeks all franchecomté submitted to the king it has ever since remained in the hands of france and seems to be forever annexed to it a monument of the weakness of the austrospanish ministry and of the vigor of that of louis xiv chapter xi the glorious campaign and death of marshal turenne while the king was proceeding in the conquest of franchecomté with that rapidity ease and glory which seemed inseparably annexed to his arms turenne who was only defending the frontiers toward the rhine displayed all that was great and consummate in the art of war our esteem for men is generally measured by the difficulties they surmount and this it was that gained turenne such great reputation in this campaign in the first place in june      he made a long and hasty march passed the rhine at philippsburg marched all night to sinsheim which he took by storm and at the same time attacked and routed the emperors general caprara and the old duke of lorraine charles iv a prince who had spent his life in losing his dominions and raising troops and who had lately joined his little army to a part of the emperors turenne after having defeated him     pursued him and routed his cavalry at ladenburg then he by hasty marches came up with the prince of bournonville another of the imperial generals who was only waiting for fresh troops to open a way into alsace turenne prevented him from being joined by these troops attacked him and obliged him to quit the field of battle the empire now assembled all its forces against him seventy thousand germans occupied alsace and blocked up the towns of breisach and philippsburg turennes army did not consist of over twenty thousand effective men but having received a small reinforcement of cavalry from the prince of condé who was then in flanders in december      he crossed the mountains covered with snow marched through tanne and belfort entered upper alsace and appeared in the midst of the enemys quarters who thought him lying inactive in lorraine and looked upon the campaign as already finished he beat up the quarters at mülhausen that resisted and made two thousand of them prisoners he then marched to colmar where the elector of brandenburg who was called the great elector and was at that time general of the armies of the empire had his headquarters and came upon him just as he and the rest of the princes and general officers were going to sit down to dinner they had hardly time to escape and in one instant the country was covered with the flying turenne who thought he had done nothing while     there was anything left to be done lay in wait near türkheim for a party of the enemys foot who were to march that way he had chosen so advantageous a pass that he was certain of success accordingly he entirely defeated this body in short this army of seventy thousand men was beaten and dispersed almost without any great battle alsace fell into the kings hands and the generals of the empire were obliged to repass the rhine all these actions following so rapidly upon one another conducted with so much art managed with such patience and executed with so much promptitude were equally admired by france and her enemies but turennes reputation received a considerable addition when it was known that all he had done in this campaign had been done without the consent of the court and even against the repeated orders sent to him by louvois in the kings name it was not the least instance of turennes courage nor the least memorable exploit of this campaign thus to oppose the powerful louvois and take upon himself the consequences in defiance of the outcries of the court his masters orders and the hatred of the ministry it is certain that those who had more humanity than esteem for military exploits were greatly displeased at this glorious campaign which was as much distinguished by the miseries of the private people as by the great deeds of turenne after the battle of sinsheim he laid waste with fire and sword     the palatinate a level and fertile country full of rich cities and villages and the elector palatine from his castle at mannheim beheld two cities and twentyfive villages burned before his eyes this unhappy prince in the first emotions of his rage wrote a letter to turenne filled with the bitterest reproaches and defying him to single combat turenne having sent this letter to the king who forbade him to accept the challenge he made no other return to the electors reproaches and defiance than an empty compliment which signified nothing this was agreeable to the general behavior and style of turenne who always expressed himself in a cool and ambiguous manner he in the same cold blood destroyed the ovens and burned all the cornfields in alsace to prevent the enemy from finding subsistence he afterward permitted his cavalry to ravage lorraine where they committed such disorders that the intendant who on his side laid waste that province with his pen wrote to desire the marshal to put a stop to the excesses of the soldiery who always replied coolly i shall take notice of it in the orders turenne was better pleased to be esteemed the father of the men who were entrusted to his care than of the people who according to the rules of war are always the victims all the evil he did seemed necessary his reputation covered everything and besides the seventy thousand germans whom he prevented from entering france would     have done more mischief there than he did in alsace lorraine and the palatinate the prince of condé on his side fought a battle in flanders which was much more bloody than all the victories of turenne though it proved neither so fortunate nor decisive or rather because he had abler generals and better troops to encounter this was the battle of seneffe the marquis of feuquières insists that it should be called only a fight because it was not an action between two armies drawn up in battle array and that the corps were not all engaged but it seems generally agreed to give the title of battle to this hot and bloody day it is always the importance of an affair which determines its appellation had three thousand men ranged in battle array been engaged with each other and even all their different corps been in action it would have been only called a fight the prince of condé who was to keep the field with only fortyfive thousand men against the prince of orange with more than sixty thousand waited for the enemys army to pass a defile at seneffe near mons and fell upon a part of the rear guard composed of spaniards over whom he gained a considerable advantage the prince of orange was blamed for not having taken sufficient precaution in passing through this defile but everyone admired the dexterous manner in which he repaired this accident and condé himself was censured for attempting to renew the fight against an enemy   0 so strongly intrenched the combat was renewed three different times the two generals in this medley of errors and great deeds equally distinguished themselves by their presence of mind and courage of all the battles in which the great condé had been engaged there was no one in which he hazarded his own life and that of his soldiers so much as in this after having sustained three bloody attacks he was for attempting the fourth the prince of condé said one of the officers who was there present seemed to be the only person who had an inclination for fighting what was most remarkable in this action was that both armies after having stood the most obstinate and bloody engagement were seized with a sudden panic in the night and took to flight the next day they retreated without either side having kept the field of battle or claimed the victory both being equally weakened and defeated there were about seven thousand killed and five thousand made prisoners on the side of the french and the enemys loss was nearly equal this useless carnage prevented either army from undertaking anything of moment against the other but the appearance of advantage was at that time so necessary that the prince of orange in order to make the world believe that he had gained the victory laid siege to oudenarde however the prince of condé soon showed that he had not lost the battle by obliging him to raise the siege and pursuing him in his retreat     it was the practice with the french and the allies to observe the idle ceremony of giving public thanks for a victory they had not gained a custom established to keep up the spirit of the populace who must always be deceived turenne with his little army continued to make some progress in germany by the mere efforts of his military genius the council of vienna not daring to trust any longer the fate of the empire to princes who had made so bad a defence once more delivered the command of its armies to general montecuculi who had defeated the turks in the battle of st gothard and who in spite of the endeavors of turenne and condé had effected a junction with the prince of orange and checked the career of louiss conquest after he had reduced three of the seven united provinces it has been elsewhere remarked that the empire had been frequently indebted to italy for its greatest generals this country though in a state of degeneration and slavery still produces men who put us in mind of what it has once been montecuculi was the only person fit to be opposed to turenne they had both brought war to an art they spent four months in following and observing each other in their marches and encampments which were held in greater esteem by the french and germans officers than even victories each of them judged what his adversary had in view by the very steps which he himself would have taken on the same occasion and     they were seldom deceived they opposed each other with perseverance cunning and activity at last they were on the point of coming to an engagement and staking their reputations on the fate of a battle near the village of saltzbach when on july         turenne was killed by a cannon ball as he was going to fix upon a place for erecting a battery everyone is acquainted with the particulars of this great mans death but we cannot refrain from repeating some of the principal circumstances of an event which continues to be spoken of to this day there is one indeed which it is hardly possible to repeat too often the ball which deprived turenne of his life carried off the arm of st hiliare lieutenantgeneral of the artillery whose son threw himself down by his side in a flood of tears weep not for me said that brave officer but for that great man pointing to turenne these words are equal to anything that history has consecrated as most heroic and form the worthiest eulogium of the great turenne it is seldom that in a despotic government where everyone is wholly taken up with his own private concerns those who have served their country die regretted nevertheless turenne was lamented by his own soldiers and by the people louvois was the only one who rejoiced at his death everyone knows that the king caused the greatest honors to be paid to his memory and that he was interred at st denis as the constable du guesclin had been to whom the public voice declares him     as much superior as the age he lived in was superior to that of the constable turenne had not always been successful in the field he had been beaten at mariendal rethel and cambray he had likewise been guilty of some faults and was great man enough to own them he had never gained very striking victories nor fought any of those pitched battles which decide the fate of one or the other nation but by always repairing his defeats and doing a great deal with a little he passed for the ablest general in europe in an age when the art of war was better understood than ever it had been in like manner though he had been accused of having deserted his party in the civil wars and though when almost sixty years of age he had suffered love to make him reveal a secret of state and had exercised some unnecessary barbarities in the palatinate yet he still preserved the character of an upright prudent and honest man because his virtues and great talents which were peculiar to himself made the world forget those weaknesses and failings which were common to the rest of mankind if we were to compare him to anyone we might venture to say that of all the generals of past ages gonsalvo de cordova surnamed the great captain was the person whom he most resembled he was born a protestant but in      he embraced the roman catholic religion it was not supposed by either protestant or philosopher that     this change was the effect of mere persuasion only in a warrior and a statesman of fifty years old who still kept mistresses it is well known that louis xiv when he created him marshalgeneral of his armies spoke to him in these very words which we find related by pellisson in his letters and others i wish you would lay me under an obligation of doing more for you these words—according to these writers—might together with time have been the means of bringing about this conversion the place of constable might perhaps have entered into an ambitious mind it is also possible that this conversion might be sincere the human heart frequently unites politics ambition religious sentiments and amorous weaknesses but the catholics who triumphed in this change would never be persuaded that the great soul of turenne was capable of double dealing the turn which affairs took in alsace immediately after the death of turenne made his loss more sensibly felt montecuculi who had for three months been kept on the other side of the rhine by the french general passed that river the instant he knew he no longer had turenne to fear he then fell upon a part of the army which remained thunderstruck with its loss under the command of the two lieutenantgenerals de lorges and vauban though the french defended themselves with great valor they could not hinder the imperialists from     penetrating into alsace from which turenne had always kept them at a distance the army stood in need of a leader not only to conduct it but also to retrieve the late defeat which had happened to marshal de créqui a man of enterprising genius capable at once of the noblest and rashest actions and equally dangerous to his country and its enemies he had through his own fault been beaten at consarbruck august         and his little army routed and cut to pieces by a body of twenty thousand germans who were laying siege to trier hardly onefourth of his troops escaped after this accident he marched with the utmost precipitation through a thousand dangers and threw himself into trier which he defended with the greatest valor whereas he should have relieved it by a prudent management he resolved to bury himself in the ruins of the place before he would give it up and even when a breach was made practicable he still continued to hold out the garrison began to murmur at this obstinacy and one captain boisjourdan who was at the head of the mutineers repaired to the breach and proposed a capitulation never was cowardice carried on with so much boldness he threatened to kill the marshal unless he would sign the capitulation créqui upon this retires with some officers who remained faithful to him to a neighboring church and chose rather to be a prisoner at discretion than to capitulate     to recruit the great loss of men which the kingdom had sustained by so many sieges and battles louis xiv was advised not to confine himself to the usual levies from among the militia but to issue his orders for assembling the ban and arrièreban by an ancient custom which is now laid aside all those that held lands in fee were obliged to serve their lords paramount in the wars at their own expense and to continue in arms for a certain number of days this service was one of the principal laws of our barbarous nations things are at present on a very different footing in europe every kingdom now raises soldiers who are kept in constant pay and form a regular and disciplined body louis xiii had once during his reign assembled the nobility of his kingdom louis xiv now followed his example the body of nobility took the field under the command of the marquis afterward marshal of rochefort and marched to the frontiers of flanders and thence to the borders of germany but this body was neither great in its numbers nor useful in its operations nor indeed could be rendered so the gentlemen who had a military turn and were fit for service had all commissions in the army those whom age or discontent had kept at home remained there and the rest who were employed in improving their estates came with repugnance to the number of about four thousand in short they were far from having the appearance of military troops they were all differently     mounted and accoutred void of experience ignorant of discipline and either incapable or averse to regular service so that they caused only confusion and were forever laid aside this was the last trace of ancient chivalry which appeared in our regular armies of which those armies were formerly composed and which though possessed of all the courage natural to their nation never fought well turenne dead créqui beaten and a prisoner trier taken and montecuculi laying all alsace under contribution the king thought that the prince of condé alone was able to revive the drooping spirits of the army discouraged by the death of turenne condé left marshal luxembourg to support the french in flanders and hastened to check the progress of montecuculi on this occasion he showed as much coldness as he had shown impetuosity at seneffe and with a genius which conformed itself to everything he displayed the same art as turenne had done by two encampments only he stopped the progress of the german army and obliged montecuculi to raise the sieges of haguenau and saverne during august and september      after this campaign which was indeed less brilliant but more esteemed than that of seneffe this prince no longer appeared in the character of a warrior he was desirous of having his son appointed to the command in his stead and offered to assist him with his advice but the king did not choose to have either     young men or princes for generals it was even not without reluctance that he had employed the prince of condé who owed his being at the head of the army to louvoiss jealousy of turenne as much as to his own great reputation the prince retired to chantilly and rarely came to versailles to see his glory eclipsed in a place where the courtier regards only favor during the remainder of his life he was greatly tormented with the gout but he consoled himself in the midst of his anguish and disgrace by the conversation of men of genius of all kinds with which france then abounded he was truly worthy of their acquaintance being himself acquainted with most of the arts and sciences in which they excelled he still continued the object of admiration even in his retirement till at length that devouring fire which had in his youth made him the impetuous hero and subject to a number of passions having by degrees consumed the vigor of a body which was by nature formed rather active than robust he experienced a total decay before his time and his mind growing as weak as his body nothing of the great condé remained during the last two years of his life he died in    0 montecuculi retired from the emperors service about the time that the great condé resigned the command of the armies of france     chapter xii from the death of turenne till the peace of nimeguen in      notwithstanding that turenne was dead and the prince of condé withdrawn from the army the king still continued the war against the emperor the spaniards and the dutch with as much success as before he had a number of officers who had been trained up under these great men he had louvois who was as good as a general to him because by his ready foresight he furnished the generals with means of undertaking everything they desired and the troops by a long series of victories retained that ardor with which the presence of a monarch ever fortunate in his undertakings had inspired them during the course of this war he in person took condé bouchain valenciennes and cambray he was accused by some of having been afraid to engage the prince of orange who at the siege of bouchain presented himself with an army of fifty thousand men in order to relieve the place the prince of orange was reproached with not having given battle to louis when he might have done it for such is the fate of kings and generals that they are always blamed for what they do and for what they do not do but neither the king nor the prince of orange was in the least to blame the former did   0 not give battle although he was desirous of it because monterey who was governor of the netherlands and who was then in his army did not choose to expose his province to the chance of a decisive action and the honor of the campaign was undoubtedly on the kings side since he did what he pleased and took a town in sight of his enemy with regard to the town of valenciennes it was taken by assault by one of those singular events which characterize the impetuous courage of the french nation the king carried on this siege assisted by his brother and five marshals of france namely dhumières schomberg la feuillade luxembourg and de lorges the marshals had each their day of command in turn and vauban had the direction of all the operations they had not yet made themselves masters of any of the outworks of the place the first thing to be done was to attack two halfmoons behind which was a large crownwork guarded with palisades and friezes and surrounded by a ditch intersected with several traverses within this crownwork was another work surrounded by another ditch when all these intrenchments were carried there was still a branch of the scheldt to be passed even after this there remained another work called a pâté behind this pâté ran the main stream of the scheldt which was very deep and rapid and which serves as a ditch to the town wall which was     defended by strong ramparts all these works were covered with artillery and a garrison of three thousand men promised a long resistance the king held a council of war about attacking the outworks it had always been a custom to make these attacks in the night in order to steal upon the enemy unperceived and save the lives of the men vauban proposed to make the attack in the day this proposal was strongly opposed by the marshals and louvois joined in condemning it vauban however maintained his opinion with the confidence of a man who is sure of what he advances you are desirous said he of saving your men as much as possible you will certainly do this much better by day when they will be able to fight without confusion and tumult or being apprehensive of one party firing upon another as too often happens in attacks by night we want to surprise the enemy who are always on their guard against an attack by night we shall therefore effectually surprise them if we oblige them to stand the attack of our fresh troops after they have been wearied out by the fatigue of the nights watch add to this that if there are any of our men who want courage the night favors their backwardness but in day the eye of the master inspires them with courage and makes them surpass themselves the king was convinced by vaubans arguments and agreed to his proposal notwithstanding the objections of the five marshals of france     at nine oclock in the morning on march         the two companies of musketeers a hundred grenadiers a battalion of the guards and another of the regiment of picardy mounted the great crownwork on all sides their orders were only to make a lodgment there and this was a great deal but some of the black musketeers having found entrance by a private passage into the inner intrenchments which were in this work presently made themselves masters of it at the same time the gray musketeers made way through another passage these were followed by the battalion of guards who fell upon the besieged killed some of them and put the rest to flight by this time the musketeers had let down the drawbridge which joined this work to the rest they followed the enemy from one intrenchment to another both on the greater and lesser branch of the scheldt the guards pressed on in crowds and the musketeers were in possession of the town before the king knew that the first work which he had ordered to be attacked was carried but this was the least considerable part of the action it is likely enough that a number of young musketeers inflamed with the ardor of success might fall upon the troops or burghers whom they met in the streets and lose their lives or else plunder the town but what is most extraordinary in this affair is that these young men under the command of a cornet called moissac drew up in     rank behind some wagons and while the rest of the troops who came in were forming with deliberation other musketeers took possession of the neighboring houses and covered with their fire those who were in the street hostages were now exchanged on each side the town council assembled and despatched a deputation to the king and all this was transacted without pillage confusion or the least outrage of any kind the king made the garrison prisoners of war and entered valenciennes with astonishment the singularity of this action engaged us to enter into this minute detail the king gained additional honor by the taking of ghent in eight days and ypres in seven his generals met with still greater success in germany indeed the duke of luxembourg at the beginning of the war suffered philippsburg to be taken in his sight after a fruitless attempt to relieve it with an army of fifty thousand men the general who took philippsburg was charles v the new duke of lorraine who succeeded his uncle charles iv and was like him stripped of his dominions he had all the good qualifications of his unhappy uncle without any of his faults he commanded the armies of the empire with great renown but notwithstanding that he had reduced philippsburg and was at the head of an army of sixty thousand men he could never get possession of his dominions and it was to no purpose that he carried these words on his colors aut nunc aut nunquam—now     or never marshal créqui now ransomed from his confinement and rendered more prudent by his defeat at consarbruck always kept the entrance into lorraine shut from him he beat him in a small skirmish at kokersberk in alsace on october        and continually harassed him in his marches he took freiburg in his sight on november         and beat a detachment of his army at rheinfelden in july      he passed the river keres in his view pursued him to offenburg fell upon him in his retreat and having immediately afterward carried the fort of rethel sword in hand he proceeded to saarburg where he burned the bridge by which that city which was still free had so many times afforded a passage for the imperial troops into alsace thus did marshal créqui make amends for the imprudence of one day by a series of successes which were wholly owing to his prudence and had he lived some time longer it is probable he would have acquired an equal reputation with turenne the prince of orange was not more successful in flanders than the duke of lorraine had been in germany he was not only obliged to raise the siege of maestricht and charleroi but after having suffered condé bouchain and valenciennes to fall into the hands of louis xiv he lost the battle of montcassel against the kings brother in attempting to relieve st omer the marshals luxembourg and dhumières were in command it is said that     the gaining of the battle was owing to an error committed by the prince of orange and a dexterous movement made by luxembourg monsieur as the brother of louis xiv was at that time called fought with a courage and presence of mind that was never expected from so effeminate a prince there could not be a stronger proof that valor is not incompatible with delicacy this prince who frequently used to go dressed like a woman and who had the same inclinations behaved on this occasion like a general and a soldier it is said that the king was jealous of the reputation he acquired he took very little notice of the victory he had gained and did not so much as go to see the field of battle though he was near by some of the staff of the duke of orleans who were more discerning than the rest prophesied to him then that he would never again have the command of an army and their predictions were verified the taking of so many towns and the gaining of so many battles were not the only successes which attended the arms of louis xiv during this war the count of schomberg and marshal navaille beat the spaniards in the lampourdan at the foot of the pyrenees and attacked them even in sicily this island since the time of the tyrants of syracuse under whom it was of some note in the world has always fallen a prey to foreigners it has been successively enslaved by the romans the vandals the arabians the norman princes vassals to the     popes the french the germans and the spaniards still hating its masters and rebelling against them without making any noble efforts to gain their liberty and continually engaged in fresh seditions only to change its chains the magistrates of messina had lately stirred up a civil war against their governors and called in the french to their assistance their harbor was blocked up by a spanish fleet and they were reduced to the last extremities of famine the chevalier de valbille was immediately sent with a few frigates to their assistance he passed through the spanish fleet and threw a supply of provisions arms and men into the city soon after the duke of vivonne arrived with seven men of war of sixty guns two of eighty and a number of fireships engaged the enemys fleet which he defeated and entered the harbor of messina in triumph february        the spaniards were obliged to have recourse to the dutch their ancient enemies who were still looked upon as masters of the sea to help them to defend sicily de ruyter sailed from the zuyder zee passed the mole of messina and reinforced the spanish fleet of twenty ships with twentythree large men of war and now the french who when joined with the english had not been able to beat the dutch fleets gained a victory alone over the combined squadrons of spain and holland on january        the duke     of vivonne who was obliged to remain in messina to restrain the populace who already began to be displeased with their defenders left the care of this engagement to duquesne his lieutenantgeneral who was a man as extraordinary in his way as de ruyter he had like him risen to the command entirely by merit but had never before had the management of a naval armament having hitherto signalized himself rather in the character of a captain of a privateer than as the commander of a regular fleet but whosoever possesses a genius for his art and for carrying command passes with great ease and quickness from the little to the great duquesne showed himself a very able officer in this action against de ruyter even though he only gained a small advantage over this experienced hollander he gave battle a second time to the enemys fleets off aosta march         in this engagement de ruyter received the wound which put an end to his glorious life he was one of those men whose memories are still held in great veneration by the people of holland on his first entrance into sea life he was only a cabin boy or captains servant which makes him so much the more respectable his name is equal with those of the princes of nassau the spanish council gave him the title and patent of duke an odd and ridiculous dignity to confer on a republican the patent however did not arrive till after he was dead when his children proving themselves worthy of such a father refused a title     which is so earnestly sought after in our monarchies but which is by no means to be preferred to the name of a good citizen louis xiv had too noble a soul not to be concerned at his death and when some of his courtiers represented to him that he was now rid of a troublesome and dangerous enemy he replied nevertheless i cannot help being afflicted with the loss of a great man duquesne the de ruyter of the french attacked the combined fleets a third time immediately upon the death of the dutch admiral and sank burned and took several of their largest ships the marshal the duke of vivonne had chief command in this action but it was nevertheless duquesne who gained the victory europe stood amazed to see france in so short a space of time become as formidable on sea as on land it is certain that these armaments and victories only served to spread the alarm through every state the king of england having entered upon the war to support the interest of france was now desirous of joining the prince of orange who had lately married his niece besides the great reputation gained in sicily cost too much money and lastly the french evacuated messina april        at the very time when they were thought to be on the point of making themselves masters of the island louis xiv was greatly blamed for having during the course of this war undertaken many things which he could not go     through with and for quitting messina as he had done holland after a fruitless conquest however it must be allowed that a prince is very formidable who is no other way unsuccessful than in not being able to keep all his conquests he pressed his enemies in every part of europe the war in sicily had not cost him nearly so much money as it did the spaniards who were distressed and beaten in every place he likewise raised up new enemies against the house of austria he fomented the troubles in hungary and his ambassadors at the ottoman porte pressed the sultan to carry the war into germany though at the same time common decency would have obliged him to send aid against those very people whom his politics had called in for at that time the swedes his old allies were engaged in an unsuccessful war against the elector of brandenburg this elector father of the first king of prussia had begun to exalt his country to that degree of reputation which has since received so considerable an addition he had just then taken pomerania from the swedes it is remarkable that during the course of this war there were almost continual conferences held for peace first at cologne upon the fruitless mediation of the swedes and afterward at nimeguen by the equally useless interposition of the english whose mediation was almost as idle a piece of ceremony as the arbitration of the pope at the treaty of nimeguen louis xiv was actually the only real  00 arbiter he made proposals for a peace april        in the midst of his victories and gave the enemy till may  0 to accept of them he afterward allowed the statesgeneral six weeks longer upon their asking it in the most submissive manner he now entirely laid aside all ambitious views upon holland that republic had been so lucky or skilful as to appear only as an auxiliary in a war which was begun for its destruction while the empire and spain who were at first only auxiliaries were at length the principal parties the king greatly favored the trade of the dutch by the conditions which he imposed upon them he restored to them the city of maestricht and gave the spaniards some towns to serve as barriers to the united provinces as charleroi courtrai oudenarde ath ghent and limburg but he reserved bouchain condé ypres valenciennes cambray maubeuge aire saint omer cassel charlemont popering and bailleul which made a great part of flanders to these he added franchecomté which had been already twice conquered and these two provinces were no despicable fruits of the war he demanded nothing more of the empire than freiburg or philippsburg which he left to the emperors choice he reinstated the two brothers fürstemberg in the bishopric of strasburg and their family estate of which they had been stripped by the emperor who still detained one of them in prison  0  he protected his allies the swedes unhappily joined with him against the king of denmark and the elector of brandenburg he insisted that denmark should give up all it had taken from sweden lower the toll duties in the baltic sea that the duke of holstein should be restored to his dominions that the elector of brandenburg should give up pomerania which he had lately conquered and that every article of the treaty of westphalia should be again renewed his will was law throughout europe the elector of brandenburg in vain wrote a letter to him in the most submissive terms in which he styles him lord and master humbly entreating that he might be permitted to keep what he had conquered with many assurances of his zeal and future service but his submission proved as useless as his resistance and the conqueror of the swedes was obliged to restore all he had taken from them and now the ambassador of france insisted upon taking the upper hand of the electors brandenburg proposed every kind of modification in order to settle a conference with the count afterwards marshal destrades who was ambassador to the statesgeneral but the king would never suffer a person who represented him to yield to an elector and the count destrades could not treat charles v had put the grandees of spain in the same rank as the electors consequently the peers of france had pretensions to the same equality at  0  present we see that things are changed in every point since in the imperial diets the ambassadors of electors are now recognized as those of crowned heads as to lorraine louis offered to restore the new duke charles v but insisted upon remaining master of nancy and all the great roads these conditions were imposed with the haughtiness of a conqueror but yet they were not so unreasonable as to drive his enemies to despair or oblige them to join together against him as the only thing left he at once dictated to europe as a master and acted as a politician at the conferences at nimeguen he found means to sow jealousy among his allies the dutch were in haste to sign despite the prince of orange who resolved at all events to carry on war alleging that the spaniards were too weak to assist them should they refuse to sign the spaniards seeing that the dutch had accepted terms of peace followed their example alleging that the empire did not seem hearty in the common cause in the last place the germans abandoned by spain and holland signed after all the others ceding freiburg to the king and confirming the treaties of westphalia there was no alteration made in the conditions prescribed by louis xiv the enemy in vain affected to make some extravagant proposals in order to disguise their own weakness he gave  0  laws and peace to all europe the duke of lorraine was the only one who refused to accede to a treaty which appeared to him in so oppressive a light he chose rather to be a prince and wander through the empire than to be a sovereign without power or honors in his own dominions and waited in expectation till time and his own courage should bring about a favorable change of fortune during the conferences at nimeguen and four days after the plenipotentiaries of france and holland had signed the treaty of peace the prince of orange showed how dangerous an enemy louis xiv had in him marshal luxembourg who was then besieging mons had lately received an account of the conclusion of the peace upon which he lay lulled in full security in the village of st denis and dined that day with the intendant of the army the prince of orange with his whole army attacked the marshals quarters and forced them a long and bloody engagement ensued from which the prince had the greatest reason to expect the most signal victory for he not only gave the attack which is a great advantage but he attacked an army which depended upon the faith of treaties and grew remiss in their military rigor marshal luxembourg could with great difficulty resist the fury of this attack and if the advantage lay on any side it was with the prince of orange whose foot remained master of the field of battle where they had fought did ambitious men pay any regard to the lives of  0  their fellow creatures the prince of orange would not have fought this battle he certainly knew that the peace was already signed or on the point of being so he knew that this peace would prove advantageous to his country and yet he hazarded his own life and that of thousands of men besides as the first fruits of a general peace which was then so far advanced that had he even beaten the french army it would have made no alteration in the congress this act as inhuman as it was glorious and which at that time was more esteemed than blamed did not produce one single additional article in the treaty and the lives of two thousand french and as many of the enemy were thrown away to no end by this peace we may see how much projects are contradicted by events holland against whom alone the war was undertaken and whose destruction seemed inevitable lost nothing at all on the contrary she gained a barrier while every other crowned head who had preserved it from destruction lost by it the king was now at the height of his greatness he had been victorious ever since he came to the throne never had besieged any place without taking it was superior in all things to those in league against him the terror of europe for six years together and at length the arbiter and peacemaker he added to his estates franchecomté dunkirk and onehalf of flanders and what he should have looked upon as one of the greatest blessings  0  he was king over a happy kingdom now the model for all other nations some time afterward—in    0—the townhouse of paris solemnly bestowed upon him the epithet of great and ordered this title alone to be placed upon all public monuments several medals had been struck as early as      with this surname on them and europe though jealous of his glory did not cry out against these honors nevertheless the name of louis xiv has prevailed among the public more than that of great custom governs all things henry who had the surname of great conferred on him after his death is commonly called henry iv and that name alone is sufficiently expressive the prince of condé is always called the great condé not only on account of his heroic deeds but from a lucky facility of distinguishing him by that means from the other princes of condé had he been called condé the great that title would never have remained with him we say the great corneille to distinguish him from his brother we do not say the great virgil the great horace or the great tasso alexander the great is now only known by the simple name of alexander charles v whose successes were more dazzling than those of louis xiv had never the surname of great it continues to be given to charlemagne only as a proper name titles are of no use to posterity the name of a man who has done great things commands more respect than the most sounding epithet  0  chapter xiii the taking of strasburg—the bombarding of algiers—the submission of the genoese—the embassy from the emperor of siam—the pope braved in rome—the succession to the electorate of cologne disputed the general peace proved no restraint upon louiss ambition the empire spain and holland disbanded their extraordinary troops but he still kept his in pay peace was to him a time of conquests he was so secure in his power at that time that he established courts of jurisdiction in mentz and breisach for annexing to the crown all the territories which were formerly dependent upon alsace or the three bishoprics but which had from time immemorial been in the hands of other masters several sovereign princes of the empire the elector palatine the king of spain himself who had several bailiwicks in these countries and the king of sweden as duke of deux ponts were summoned before these courts to do homage to the king of france under pain of having their possessions forfeited he was the only prince since the time of charlemagne who had acted thus like the lord and judge of crowned heads and conquered countries by judicial decrees the elector palatine and the elector of trier were dispossessed of the lordships of falkenberg germersheim velden etc they carried their complaints  0  before the diet of the empire assembled at ratisbon but in vain for that assembly contented itself with entering protests against these proceedings the king did not think it sufficient to be thus master of ten free cities of alsace by the same titles which the emperors formerly had no one dared even to mention liberty in any of those cities strasburg yet remained a great and opulent city and mistress of the rhine by means of the bridge which it had over that river of itself a powerful republic and famous for its arsenal which contained nine hundred pieces of cannon louvois had for a long time cherished the design of putting this city into his masters hands he had already prepared the way by bribery intrigues and menaces the magistrates were seduced and the people were struck with consternation at seeing their ramparts on a sudden surrounded by twenty thousand french their forts by which they were guarded on the side of the rhine attacked and taken in an instant louvois at their gates and their burgomasters talking of surrendering which louvois accepted taking possession of the town on sept  0      vauban has since fortified it in such a manner that it has become the strongest barrier of france the king kept no better measures with spain he claimed the town of alost in the netherlands together with its whole bailiwick which as was  0  pretended his ministers had ministers had forgotten to insert in the articles of peace and upon the spanish court making some hesitation in complying with his demand he ordered the city of luxemburg to be blockaded at the same time he purchased the city of casal of the petty duke of mantua who would have sold all his dominions to supply his pleasures europe began to be alarmed at seeing a power which thus extended itself on all sides and had acquired in the midst of peace more than ten preceding monarchs of france had gained by all their wars the emperor the dutch and even the swedes themselves finding great reason to be displeased with louiss proceedings entered into a treaty of association the english threw out some threats the spaniards resolved on war and the prince of orange left no stone unturned to fan the flame but no power as yet dared to strike the first blow the king who was feared everywhere sought only how to make himself more formidable he increased the power of his marine beyond the most sanguine hopes of his subjects or the liveliest apprehensions of his enemies he had sixty thousand sailors in pay and this rude body of men were kept to their duty by laws as severe as those observed with respect to the military forces the english and dutch on the contrary though such powerful maritime nations had neither so many seamen nor such good regulations several companies of cadets and  0  marine guards were formed and stationed in the frontier towns and the seaports who were trained in all the arts requisite to their profession under the care of masters paid out of the public treasury the harbor of toulon in the mediterranean was formed at immense expense capable of containing a hundred ships of war with an arsenal and magnificent storehouses the port of brest was formed in the western ocean at an equal expense dunkirk and havredegrâce were filled with shipping and nature herself was forced at rochefort at length louis had above a hundred ships of the line of which several mounted a hundred guns and others more these were not suffered to lie idle in port his squadrons under the command of duquesne cleared the seas of the algerine and tripoline pirates which infested them and punished algiers by the help of a new art the discovery of which was owing to the care he took to encourage all kinds of genius in his reign this fatal but admirable art is that of bombvessels with which seaport towns may be reduced to ashes there was a young man named bernard renaud better known by the name of little renaud who by mere strength of genius became an excellent mariner without ever having served on board a ship colbert who found out merit wherever it was hidden had frequently sent for this man to the council of marine even when the king was present it was in pursuance of his diligent observations and instructions that they afterward   0 devised a more uniform and easy method of building ships renaud had the boldness to propose in council to bombard algiers with a fleet of ships everyone present started at the proposal not having the least conception that a mortar could be fired anywhere but on solid ground in short he underwent all the raillery and contradiction which one must expect who offers a new invention but his firmness and that eloquence which naturally accompanies those who are forcibly struck with their own invention prevailed upon the king to permit a trial of this new project renaud then caused five vessels to be built of a lesser size than common but much stronger without any upper decks and only a platform or false deck on the keel in which hollow spaces were formed for receiving the mortars as in beds thus equipped he set sail under the command of old duquesne who had charge of this expedition from which he expected little success but the effect of the bombs filled both the admiral and the algerines with surprise half of the town being beaten down and laid in ashes on oct         however this art being soon communicated to other nations served only to multiply the calamities of humankind and proved more than once fatal to france where it was invented this improvement in the marine within a few years was wholly owing to the care and vigilance of colbert louvois was continually employed in fortifying     upward of one hundred citadels besides building the new ones of hüningen saarlouis the fortresses of saarburg montroyal and others and while the kingdom was acquiring this exterior strength the arts flourished within and pleasure and abundance reigned everywhere strangers came in crowds to admire the court of louis xiv whose name was carried to the most distant nations of the earth his glory and success received a further addition from the weakness of most of the other crowned heads in europe and the miserable state of their people the emperor leopold was at that time in fear of the rebellious hungarians and especially of the turks whom they had called in to their assistance and were preparing to invade germany louis thought it politic to persecute the protestants of his own kingdom in order to prevent them from being able to create any disturbance but he underhandedly protected the protestants and rebels in hungary because they might be of service to him his ambassadors at the turkish court had importuned the sultan to fit out an armament before the peace of nimeguen the divan by an unaccountable singularity has almost always waited till the emperor was at peace to break with him the war in hungary was not begun until      and the ensuing year the turkish army of two hundred thousand men reinforced by several bodies of hungarian troops meeting with no fortified towns such as there are in     france nor any regular army to oppose its progress advanced to the very gates of vienna after laying all waste in its march the emperor leopold at the approach of the turks quitted vienna with the utmost precipitation and retired to linz and when he heard that they had invested his capital he only retired to a still greater distance to passau leaving the duke of lorraine at the head of a small army which had already been attacked by the turks in their march to defend the empire as well as he could no one had the least doubt that the grand vizier caramustapha who commanded the ottoman army would soon be master of vienna a badly fortified city abandoned by its sovereign and defended only by a garrison of ten thousand effective men though called sixteen thousand in short a dreadful revolution was momentarily expected louis xiv had the greatest reason to expect that germany thus distressed by the turks and having no resource but in a chief whose flight had increased the general terror would soon be forced to fly to the protection of france he had an army on the borders of the empire ready to defend it against those very turks whom he had brought thither by his former negotiations by this means he hoped to become protector of the empire and to make his son king of the romans at first when the turks threatened austria with an invasion he added generosity to his political     views not that he sent help a second time to the emperor but he declared that he would not attack the low countries but would leave the austrianspanish branch at liberty to assist that of germany which was on the point of being overwhelmed all that he asked in return for lying quiet was to be satisfied with respect to some disputable points in the treaty of nimeguen and chiefly relating to the bailiwick of alost which had by mistake been omitted in the treaty he actually ordered the blockade of luxemburg to be raised in      without waiting to be satisfied and abstained from all hostilities for one whole year but he did not observe the same generosity afterward during the siege of vienna the spanish council instead of soothing incensed him and he renewed hostilities in the netherlands at the very time that vienna was on the point of falling into the hands of the turks this was in the beginning of september but contrary to all expectation vienna was relieved the presumption effeminacy ignorance and slothfulness of the grand vizier together with his brutal contempt for the christians proved his ruin nothing less than such a combination of faults could have preserved the capital of the empire john sobieski king of poland had time to march to its relief and having joined the duke of lorraine he presented himself before the ottoman army on sept         who fled at his first appearance the emperor returned to his capital grieved and astonished at having     quitted it he entered just as his deliverer was coming out of the high church where they had been singing te deum and the preacher had taken these words for his text there was a man sent from god and his name was john you may have already observed that the same words were applied by pope pius v to don john of austria after the victory of lepanto you know that what at first appears new is frequently no other than a repetition the emperor leopold was at once triumphant and humbled the french king having no longer any measures to keep bombarded luxemburg and seized upon courtrai and dixmude in flanders he then made himself master of trier and demolished its fortifications and all this as he said to fulfil the spirit of the treaty of nimeguen the imperialists and spaniards entered into a negotiation with him at ratisbon while he was taking their towns and the treaty of nimeguen which had been infringed was changed into a truce for twenty years by which the king was left in possession of the city of luxemburg and its principality which he had lately conquered louis was still more formidable on the coast of barbary where till his time the french had been known only by some of their nation which fell into the hands of the barbarians and were made slaves the inhabitants of algiers after their city had been twice bombarded sent deputies to make their submission and demand peace they delivered up     all the christian captives in their possession besides paying a considerable sum of money which is the greatest punishment that can be inflicted on a corsair tunis and tripoli made like submission and here it may not be impertinent to relate the following anecdote one damfreville captain of a french ship of war having come to algiers to release all the christian captives there in the french kings name found several englishmen among them who after they were on board insisted to damfreville that it was on the king of englands account that they had been set at liberty upon which the french captain sent for the algerine officers and putting the english into their hands again said these people pretend that they are released wholly in their own kings name mine therefore will not take the liberty of offering them his protection i therefore deliver them up to you again it now remains with you to show what you owe the king of england the english were carried back to their former slavery this anecdote may serve to show the pride of the english the weakness of charles ii and the respect which all nations had for louis xiv this respect was so general that new honors were granted to his ambassador at the ottoman porte the same as to the sufis at the very time that he was humbling the people of barbary who are immediately under the protection of the grand seignior the republic of genoa humbled itself before him still more than that of algiers the genoese had     sold powder and bombs to the algerines they were also building four galleys for the service of the king of spain the king sent st olon one of his gentlemen in ordinary in character of an envoy to forbid their launching those galleys threatening them with instant punishment if they did not comply with his will the genoese incensed at this attempt on their liberties and reckoning too much upon the assistance of spain refused to give the king any satisfaction immediately fourteen large ships twelve galleys six bombvessels and several frigates set sail from the port of toulon having on board the new secretary of the marine seignelay son of the famous colbert who had procured him this post before his death this young man was full of ambition courage wit and vivacity and wanted to be at once the soldier and the minister he was greedy for honor ardent in all his undertakings and knew how to blend pleasures with business without impeding either old duquesne had the command of the large ships and the duke of mortemart of the galleys but they were both dependents on the secretary of state the fleet arrived before genoa on march         and the ten bombvessels threw fourteen thousand shells into the town by which a part of those noble marble buildings whence genoa had its name of superb were reduced to ashes four thousand men were then landed from the fleet who advanced to the gates of the city and burned the suburb of st pietro darena the inhabitants     now found it necessary to submit in order to avoid total ruin the king insisted that the doge and four of the principal senators of genoa should repair to his palace at versailles there to implore his clemency and lest the genoese should elude the required satisfaction and diminish his glory on this occasion he further insisted that the doge should be continued in his office notwithstanding a perpetual law in genoa by which any doge who is absent but a moment from the city is deprived of his dignity imperialo lescaro doge of genoa accompanied by senators lomelino garebardi durazzo and salvago arrived in versailles feb         to perform all that the king demanded of them the doge dressed in his robes of state with a red velvet cap on his head which he frequently took off while he spoke made his submission the words and gestures he used on this occasion were all dictated by seignelay the king gave him audience sitting and covered but as in every action of his life he always joined politeness with dignity he behaved toward lescaro and the senators with as much goodness as pomp his ministers louvois croissi and seignelay treated them more haughtily which made the doge say the king deprives our hearts of liberty by the manner in which he receives us but his ministers restore it to us again this doge was a man of great wit and understanding everyone knows the answer he made to the marquis of seignelay when he asked him what he thought most     remarkable at versailles to see myself there replied he the great fondness which louis xiv had for pomp and show was still more gratified by an embassy which he received from siam a country which till that time had never heard of such a kingdom as france it happened by one of those extraordinary events which prove the superiority of the europeans over all other nations that a greek named faulcon constance the son of a tavernkeeper at cephalonia was made barcalon that is prime minister or grand vizier of the kingdom of siam this man desirous of strengthening and increasing his authority wanted for that purpose to call in some foreign assistance but did not dare to trust either the dutch or the english who are dangerous neighbors in the indies the french had lately settled some factories on the coast of coromandel and had brought the fame of their monarch with them into that extreme part of asia constance thought louis xiv a proper person to be flattered by homage coming from so distant a place and so little expected religion which is the masterspring of worldly politics from siam to paris proved subservient to his design accordingly in      he sent a solemn embassy and magnificent presents in the name of the king of siam his master to louis xiv to acquaint him that the indian monarch charmed with his fame was resolved to enter into a treaty of commerce with no other nation than the french     and that he even had some thoughts of becoming a christian the king thus flattered in his greatness and deceived on the side of religion engaged to send the king of siam two ambassadors and six jesuits to whom he afterward added some officers and eight hundred soldiers but the pomp of this embassy was all the fruit it produced constance four years afterward fell a victim to his own ambition part of the french who remained with him were massacred and the rest were obliged to fly while his widow after having been on the point of becoming queen was by the king of siams successor condemned to serve in his kitchen as a cook an employment which suited her birth that thirst for glory which led louis xiv to distinguish himself in everything from other kings showed itself again in the haughty manner with which he affected to treat the court of rome odescalchi the son of a banker of milan was at that time in the papal chair with the name of innocent xi he was a virtuous man a prudent pontiff a middling divine and a courageous resolute and magnificent prince he assisted the empire and the poles against the turks with his money and the venetians with his galleys he blamed louis xiv in the severest terms for joining with the turks against the christians it was surprising to see a pope thus warmly espousing the cause of the emperors who style themselves kings of the romans and would if they could establish the   0 seat of their empire in rome but odescalchi was born under the austrian dominion and had even made two campaigns in the army of milan all men are governed by habit and humor his pride was hurt by the haughtiness of louis xiv who on his side did everything to mortify him that a king of france can do to a pope without absolutely separating from his communion an abuse had prevailed for a long time in rome which was the more difficult to be eradicated as it was founded on a point of honor upon which the catholics piqued themselves their ambassadors at rome extended the right of franchise and asylum belonging to their palaces to a great distance under the general name of quarters these privileges which were strictly maintained made onehalf of rome an asylum for all kinds of villainy by another abuse whatever was brought into rome under the ambassadors name was free from all duty by this means trade suffered and the state was impoverished at length pope innocent xi prevailed on the emperor the kings of spain and poland and on the new king of england james ii who was a catholic to give up these odious privileges the nuncio ranucci proposed to louis to concur with these princes in restoring the peace and good order of rome but louis who in his heart hated the pope returned for answer that he never regulated his conduct by the example of others who rather ought himself to serve as an example for them he then     sent the marquis de lavardin on an embassy to rome purposely to insult the pope lavardin accordingly made his entrance into that city in november      in spite of the popes prohibition and escorted by four hundred of the marine guards the same number of volunteer officers and two hundred men in livery all armed he immediately went and took possession of his palace the quarters thereunto belonging and the church of st louis round which he ordered sentinels to be placed and to go the rounds as in a garrison the pope is the only sovereign to whom such an embassy can be sent for the superiority which he always affects over crowned heads makes them always desirous of humbling him and the weakness of his dominions permits them to insult him with impunity all that innocent xi could do was to attack the marquis de lavardin with the wornout weapon of excommunication a weapon which is now as little regarded in rome as elsewhere but which nevertheless was employed by an ancient ceremonial in the same manner as the popes soldiers carry arms merely for forms sake cardinal destrées a man of sense but generally unfortunate in his negotiations was at that time resident from the court of france at rome destrées being obliged to make frequent visits to the marquis de lavardin could not afterward be admitted to an audience of the pope without receiving absolution he in vain endeavored to evade this     ceremony innocent persisted in giving it to him in order to keep up an imaginary power by the customs on which it was founded louis through the same motives of pride though secretly supported by politics endeavored to make an elector of cologne full of the scheme of dividing or making war with the empire he thought to confer this electorate on cardinal fürstemberg bishop of strasburg his creature and the victim of his interests and an irreconcilable enemy to the emperor who had ordered him to be imprisoned in the preceding war as a german who had sold himself to france the chapter of cologne like all the other chapters of germany has a right to nominate its bishop who by that becomes elector the person who then filled this see was ferdinand of bavaria formerly the ally and afterward the enemy of louis as many other princes had been he now lay at the point of death the king by money intrigues and promises prevailed on the canons to choose fürstemberg coadjutor and after the death of ferdinand he was chosen a second time by a majority of votes by the germanic concordat the pope has the right of conferring the bishopric on the bishopelect and the emperor that of confirming him in the electorate the emperor and pope innocent persuaded that to leave fürstemberg in possession of the electoral dignity was the same as if they had given it to louis xiv joined together to bestow this principality     upon young bavaria brother to the deceased prince the king avenged himself on the pope by taking avignon from him in october      and made preparations for a war against the emperor at the same time he disturbed the elector palatine on account of the rights of the princess palatine second wife of the duke of orleans rights which she had renounced by her marriage articles the war began in spain in the year      on account of the claims of maria theresa notwithstanding that a like renunciation made which plainly proves that contracts can only bind private persons in this manner did the king in the height of his greatness perplex strip or humble almost all the princes of europe but they in return almost all joined in league against him chapter xiv james ii of england dethroned by his soninlaw william iii and protected by louis xiv the prince of orange still more ambitious than even louis xiv had conceived vast designs which might appear chimerical in a stadtholder of holland but which he justified by his great abilities and courage he wanted to humble the king of france and dethrone the king of england he found no great difficulty in getting the powers of europe to join with him against france the emperor some princes of the empire the dutch and the duke of     lorraine had at first entered into a private league at augsburg in      and were soon after joined by spain and the duke of savoy the pope without being actually one of the confederates set them all to work by his intrigues the venetians without openly declaring themselves favored their designs in secret and all the princes of italy were sympathetic in the north sweden at that time sided with the imperialists and denmark was a useless ally to france upward of five hundred thousand protestants who had been driven out of france by the persecution of louis and had carried with them their industry and an irreconcilable hatred to the french king were as a new body of enemies who dispersed themselves through all the courts of europe and animated the confederate powers already inclined to war we shall speak of the flight of these people in the chapter on religion the king was surrounded by enemies on all sides and had no friend but king james of england james ii who succeeded his brother charles ii was a catholic but charles did not consent to become a catholic till toward the latter part of his life and then only out of compliance with his mistresses and his brother in fact he acknowledged no other religion but that of pure deism his perfect indifference in those points which divide mankind in their disputations had contributed not a little to render his reign peaceable among the english james on the contrary attached by strong persuasion     to the roman catholic religion from his youth joined to his belief the spirit of party and zeal had he been a mahometan or of the religion of confucius the english would never have disturbed his reign but he formed a design to establish the roman catholic religion in his kingdom which was looked upon with the utmost horror by these republican royalists as a religion of slavery it is sometimes a very easy matter to establish a religion in a country constantine clovis gustavus vasa and queen elizabeth did without any danger introduce a new religion into their kingdoms by different methods and had it received by the people but to bring about changes of this kind there are two things absolutely necessary—a depth of politics and a lucky concurrence of circumstances both of which were wanting here he could not without indignation reflect that so many kings of europe were despotic that those of sweden and denmark had lately become so and in a word that poland and england were the only kingdoms in the world where the liberty of the people subsisted at the same time with royalty he was encouraged by louis xiv to render himself absolute at home and the jesuits persuaded him to restore their religion and with it their credit but he took such unfortunate measures to compass this that at his first setting out he turned all hearts against him he began as if he had already obtained the end he aimed at he entertained a nuncio     from the pope publicly at his court with a train of jesuits and capuchin friars he threw seven english bishops into prison whom he should have won over by gentle means deprived the city of london of its privileges instead of indulging it with new ones and overturned the laws with a high hand which he should have secretly undermined in a word he acted with so little discretion that the cardinals at rome used to say of him by way of jest that he ought to be excommunicated as a person who was going about to destroy the little catholic religion that remained in england pope innocent xi conceived such indifferent hopes of jamess projects that he never would grant a cardinals hat which that prince solicited for his confessor father peters this jesuit was a hotheaded intriguing man who mad with the ambition of becoming a cardinal and primate of england pushed his master to the brink of the precipice the principal persons of the kingdom combined in secret to prevent the kings designs and sent a deputation to the prince of orange they conducted their plot with such prudence and secrecy that the court was lulled into full security the prince of orange fitted out a fleet on board of which were to be embarked between fourteen and fifteen thousand men this prince who was only an illustrious private person and had hardly five hundred thousand livres a year of his own estate was nevertheless so happy in his politics that he saw     himself master of money a fleet and the hearts of the statesgeneral he was truly a king in holland by his skilful conduct while james lost all regal power in england by his precipitate rashness it was at first stated that this armament was designed against france the true destination was kept a profound secret though intrusted to more than two hundred persons barillon the french ambassador at london a man of pleasure and more conversant in the intrigues of jamess mistresses than those of europe was the first imposed upon louis xiv however was not to be thus deceived he saw what was going forward and offered his assistance to his friend and ally who thinking himself secure rejected that aid which he afterward solicited when it was too late and the prince of oranges fleet was under sail he had been wanting to himself and he now found everything fail him at once he in vain wrote to the emperor leopold that prince returned for answer nothing has befallen you but what we had foretold he depended on his fleet but his ships suffered those of the enemy to pass them he might however have defended himself by land he had an army of twenty thousand men and if he had led them on without giving them time for reflection it is probable they would have done their duty but instead of that he gave them leisure to fix their determination several of his general officers abandoned him and among the rest the famous churchill who afterward proved as fatal     to louis as he had done to james and became so illustrious under the name of the duke of marlborough he was the favorite of james his creature brother of his mistress and a lieutenantgeneral in his army notwithstanding which he left him and went over to the prince of orange at his camp james saw himself abandoned by his soninlaw the prince of denmark and even by his own daughter the princess anne and now finding himself attacked and pursued by one of his sonsinlaw abandoned by the other deserted by his own daughters and bosom friends and hated even by those of his subjects who were of his own party he looked upon his fortune as desperate and without waiting for the issue of a battle resolved upon flight the last resource of a vanquished prince at length after being stopped in his flight by the populace illtreated by them and carried back to london receiving submissively the orders of the prince of orange in his own palace seeing his guard relieved by that princes without the least resistance driven from his house and made a prisoner at rochester he took advantage of the liberty purposely given him to quit his kingdom and sought an asylum in france this was the epoch of the true english liberty the nation represented by its parliament fixed the longcontested limits of the royal prerogative and the privileges of the people and having prescribed to the prince of orange the conditions on which he     was to reign chose him for their king jointly with his wife mary the daughter of king james from that time this prince was acknowledged by the greater part of europe as the lawful king of england by the name of william iii and the deliverer of that nation but in france they considered him only as the prince of orange the usurper of the dominions of his fatherinlaw in january      the fugitive king came with his wife the daughter of the duke of modena and their son the prince of wales as yet an infant to implore the protection of louis xiv the queen of england who arrived a little before her husband was astonished at the splendor with which the french monarch was surrounded and that profusion of magnificence which she beheld at versailles and still more so at the reception she met with from the king who went as far as chatou to meet her i now do you a melancholy service madam said he i hope before very long to render you one more considerable and fortunate he then conducted her to the palace of st germain where she met with the same attendance as the queen of france herself would have had and was furnished with everything that ministers to convenience or luxury presents of all kinds in gold silver plate jewels and rich stuffs among other presents she found a purse of ten thousand louis dor laid on her toilet the same attention was paid to her husband who arrived just one day after her he had six hundred thousand   0 francs a year settled on him for the expenses of his household besides an infinite number of presents which were made him he had the kings own officers and guards but this noble reception was little in comparison with the preparations which were made for restoring him to his throne never did monarch appear so grand as louis on this occasion and james seemed as mean those of the court and city by whose opinions the reputations of men are decided conceived very little esteem for him he saw nobody but jesuits he alighted at their college in the rue st antoine in paris he told them that he was a jesuit as well as themselves and what is still more extraordinary he said the truth he had got himself admitted into this order with certain ceremonies by four english jesuits when he was only duke of york this weakness of mind in a prince joined to the manner in which he had lost his crown rendered him so despicable that the courtiers diverted themselves every day with making songs about him he was driven from england and ridiculed in france where no one gave him any credit for being a catholic the archbishop of rheims brother of louvois the minister said openly in his antechamber at st germain theres a good man who has given up three kingdoms for a mass from rome he received only indulgences and pasquinades in a word throughout the whole of this revolution his religion was of so little service to him that when the prince of orange who was     the head of the calvinists set sail to go and dethrone his fatherinlaw the catholic kings minister at the hague ordered masses to be said for the success of his expedition in the midst of the humiliations which befell this fugitive prince and the liberality of louis xiv toward him it was a spectacle worthy of attention to see james touching for the kings evil in the little convent of the english nuns—whether the kings of england have arrogated this singular privilege to themselves as pretenders to the crown of france or that this ceremony has been established among them since the time of the first edward the king soon sent him over to ireland where the roman catholics still formed a strong party a squadron of thirteen ships of the first rate lay in brest road ready to carry him over all the officers courtiers and even the priests who had repaired to james at st germain had their passage to brest defrayed at the french kings expense an ambassador—m davaux—was nominated to attend the dethroned king and followed him in great state arms and ammunition of all kinds were put on board the fleet and every sort of utensil from the meanest to the most valuable the king went to st germain to take his leave of him where for the last present he gave him his own suit of armor and embracing him affectionately said the best thing i can wish you is never to see you here again james had scarcely landed in ireland with this great preparation     when he was followed by twentythree more large ships and a prodigious number of transports under the command of châteaurenaud this fleet having on may         engaged and dispersed the english squadron which attempted to oppose its passage and landed the troops in safety on its return fell in with and took seven dutch merchantmen and came back to brest victorious over the english and laden with the spoils of the dutch shortly after in march    0 a third supply set sail from the harbors of brest toulon and rochefort the ports of ireland and the english channel were covered with french ships at length tourville viceadmiral of france with seventytwo sail of large ships fell in with the english and dutch fleet of sixty sail and a fight ensued which lasted ten hours on this occasion tourville châteaurenaud destrées and nemond signalized themselves by their courage and skill and reflected honor on the french navy to which it had till then been a stranger the english and dutch who till then had been masters of the ocean and from whom the french had but a little time before learned the art of fighting their ships in line of battle were totally defeated seventeen of their ships dismasted or rendered useless were run ashore and burned by themselves the rest took refuge in the thames or on the banks of holland in this whole engagement the french lost but one small vessel and now what louis had been wishing for upward of twenty years     and which seemed so little probable came to pass he had the empire of the sea an empire which indeed was but of short duration the enemys ships of war fled before his fleets seignelay who dared to attempt the greatest things brought the galleys of marseilles upon the main ocean and the seacoast of england beheld this kind of vessel for the first time by the help of these galleys a descent was made at tynemouth and upward of thirty merchantships burned in that bay the privateers of st malo and the new harbor of dunkirk enriched themselves and the state by continual prizes in a word for the space of two years there was not a ship to be seen on the sea but those of france king james did not second in ireland these great efforts made by louis in his favor he had with him nearly six thousand french and fifteen thousand irish soldiers the river boyne ran between his army and king williams this river was fordable the water not being higher than the mens shoulders but after it was passed there was a deep marsh to cross before they could attack the irish army after which a steep ground presented itself which formed a kind of natural intrenchment william made his army pass the river in three places and began the battle in july    0 the irish who are known to be such good soldiers in france and spain have always behaved ill in their own country there are certain nations which seem made to be subject to another the english have always been superior to     the irish in genius riches and arms ireland has never been able to throw off the english yoke since first subdued by an english nobleman the french stood their ground at the battle of the boyne the irish gave way and fled king james who had not once made his appearance during the engagement either at the head of the french or irish was the first to retreat and yet he had given proofs of great courage on other occasions but there are times when valor is lost in dispiritedness king william having had his shoulder grazed by a cannonball before the battle it was reported and believed in france that he was killed this false report was received in paris with a scandalous and indecent joy the citizens and populace encouraged by some of the under magistrates made illuminations rang the bells and in several quarters of the town they burned figures made of osier to represent the prince of orange in the same manner as they burn the pope in london the cannon of the bastille were fired not by the kings order but through the indiscreet zeal of the commandant it might be supposed from these great marks of satisfaction and from what is said by a number of writers that this mad joy at the supposed death of an enemy was the effect of the great dread they had of him almost every writer french and english has observed that these rejoicings were the greatest panegyric that could be made on william iii nevertheless if we only consider the circumstances of     the times and the spirit which then reigned we shall presently discover that these transports of joy were not produced by fear the lower class of citizens and the populace know not what it is to fear an enemy unless when he threatens their city far from dreading the name of william iii the common people in france were so unjust as to despise him he had almost always been beaten by french generals the vulgar were ignorant how much real glory that prince had acquired even in his defeats william the victor of james in ireland did not yet appear in the eyes of the french an enemy worthy of louis xiv the people of paris who idolized their monarch thought him absolutely invincible the rejoicings then were not the effect of fear but hatred most of the parisians who were born under the reign of louis and moulded to despotic sway looked upon a king at that time as a demigod and a usurper as a sacrilegious monster the common people who had seen james going every day to mass detested william as a heretic the idea of a soninlaw and a daughter protestants driving their father a catholic from his throne and reigning in his stead together with that of an enemy to their king transported the parisians to a degree of fury but prudent people were of a more moderate way of thinking james returned to france leaving his rival to gain new battles in ireland and settle himself on the throne the french fleets were then employed in     bringing back their countrymen who had fought to no purpose and the irish roman catholics who being extremely poor in their own country chose to go over to france and subsist upon the kings liberality fortune had apparently very little share in any part of this revolution from the beginning to the end the characters of william and james did everything those who delight to trace the causes of events in the conduct of men will remark that king william after his victory caused a general amnesty to be published and that king james on the contrary on his way through a little town called galway hanged some of the inhabitants who had advised shutting the gates against him of two men behaving in this manner we may easily perceive who would be more likely to prevail there were still some towns in ireland that remained in jamess interest and among the rest limerick in which there were above twelve thousand soldiers the french king who still persevered in supporting jamess desperate fortunes ordered three thousand regular troops to be transported to limerick and by an additional generosity he sent all provisions necessary for the maintenance of a numerous garrison forty transport vessels under the convoy of twelve ships of war carried over every needful supply of workmens tools carriages engineers gunners bombardiers with two hundred masons a number of saddles bridles and     harnesses for upward of twenty thousand horse cannon with their carriages muskets pistols and swords for twentysix thousand men besides provisions and clothing even to shoes limerick though besieged being thus abundantly furnished with supplies of every kind hoped to see its king fight in its defence but james not appearing limerick surrendered and the french ships returned once more to the coast of ireland and brought back to france about twenty thousand soldiers and inhabitants what is perhaps more extraordinary than all the rest is that louis was not discouraged by these continued disappointments and though he had a difficult war to support against the greatest part of europe he nevertheless endeavored once more to change the fortune of the unhappy king of england by the decisive stroke of making a descent in england with twenty thousand men which were assembled between cherbourg and la hogue more than three hundred transport vessels lay ready to receive them at brest tourville with fortyfour capital ships cruised off the coast of normandy to wait for them destrées arrived in the port of toulon with thirty ships more on july         as there are some misfortunes which arise from bad conduct so there are others that can only be imputed to fortune the wind which was at first favorable to destrées squadron changed and made it impossible for him to join tourville who with his     fortyfour ships was attacked by the combined fleets of england and holland consisting of nearly a hundred sail the french were obliged to yield to superior numbers but not till after an obstinate fight of ten hours russell the english admiral pursued him for two days fourteen large ships of which there were two that carried one hundred and four guns ran ashore and the captains set fire to them to prevent their being burned by the enemy king james who was a spectator of this disaster from the neighboring shore saw all his hopes at once swallowed up this was the first check which had been given to the power of louis xiv at sea seignelay who after the death of colbert his father had continued to improve the french navy died in    0 pontchartrain who had been raised from the place of first president of brittany to that of secretary for the marine department did not suffer it to decay under his jurisdiction the same spirit still continued in the administration france had as many ships at sea after the fatal blow at la hogue as she had before for tourville commanded a fleet of sixty ships of the line and destrées one of thirty exclusive of those which were in harbor and not more than four years afterward—in     —the king fitted out another armament still more formidable than any of the former ones to transport james over to england at the head of twenty thousand french but this fleet only made its appearance on     the coast for the measures of jamess party in london were as ill concerted as those of his protector were well laid in france the dethroned kings party had now no hope left but in hatching plots against the life of his rival and almost all those who were concerned in these attempts suffered by the hands of the executioner besides it is more than probable that had they succeeded he would never have recovered his kingdom he passed the remainder of his days at st germain where he lived on louiss bounty and a pension of seventy thousand francs which he was meanspirited enough to receive privately from his daughter mary who had been accessory in dethroning him he died at st germain in the year   00 some irish jesuits pretended to assert that miracles were performed at his tomb they even talked at rome of canonizing after his death a prince whom they had abandoned when living few princes were more unhappy than james nor have we an example in history of a family for so long a time unfortunate the first of the kings of scotland his ancestors who bore the name of james after having been detained for eighteen years a prisoner in england was murdered together with his queen by his own subjects james ii the son of this prince was killed in battle against the english at nineteen years of age james iii after being imprisoned by his subjects was slain by the rebels in fight james iv fell in a battle which he   0 lost mary stuart his granddaughter after being driven from her throne and forced to take refuge in england where she languished eighteen years in prison was at length condemned to die by english judges and lost her head on a scaffold charles i grandson of this mary and king of england and scotland was sold by the scots sentenced to death by the english and executed publicly as a traitor his son james the subject of this chapter was driven from three kingdoms and to crown the misfortunes of the family even the birth of his son was disputed this son by the efforts he made to recover the throne of his fathers brought many of his friends to an untimely end and of late days we have seen prince charles edward in whom the virtues of his ancestors and the valor of king john sobieski his grandfather by the mothers side were in vain united performing exploits and suffering calamities almost beyond the reach of credit if anything can justify those who believe in an unavoidable fatality it must be the continued series of misfortunes which have befallen the family of the stuarts for over three hundred years     chapter xv the continent while william iii was invading england scotland and ireland till the year     —burning of the palatinate—victories of marshals catinat and luxembourg not having been willing to break in upon the chain of affairs in england in the preceding chapter i now return to what passed on the continent while louis was thus forming a maritime force that had never been exceeded by any state he had to make head against the emperor and princes of the empire spain the two maritime powers of england and holland become both more formidable under one chief savoy and almost all italy one such enemy as england and spain would have been quite sufficient in former times to ruin france and yet all of them united would not now make any impression upon her the king had almost constantly five different armies on foot during the course of this war sometimes six but never less than four the armies in germany and flanders frequently amounted to one hundred thousand effective men the frontier places were at the same time provided with garrisons louis had four hundred and fifty thousand men in arms including the marine troops the turkish empire so powerful in europe never had so great a number and     even the roman empire had not more nor were there ever so many wars carried on at a time those who blame louis xiv for having made himself so many enemies cannot but admire the measures which he took to defend himself and even to be beforehand with his enemies these had not as yet entirely declared themselves nor were they all united the prince of orange had not yet sailed from texel on his expedition against his fatherinlaw when france had armies upon the frontiers of holland and on the borders of the rhine the king had sent his son the dauphin who was called monseigneur into germany with an army of twenty thousand men this prince was gentle in his manners modest in his deportment and seemed greatly to resemble his mother he was then twentyseven years old and this was the first time he had been intrusted with a command after his behavior had given sufficient proofs that he would not make an ill use of his power the king spoke to him in public thus at his departure my son in sending you to command my armies i give you an opportunity of making your merit known go and display it to all europe that when i depart this life it may not be perceived that the king is dead the prince had a special commission for this command as if he had been only a private general whom the king had made choice of the kings letters were directed to our son the dauphin our lieutenantgeneral     commanding our armies in germany everything had been so ordered and disposed beforehand that the son of louis xiv who assisted in this expedition with his name and presence might not be apt to meet with an affront marshal de duras had in fact the command of the army bouflers had a body of troops on this side of the rhine and marshal dhumières another near cologne to watch the movements of the enemy heidelberg and mentz were taken the siege of philippsburg which is always the first step to be taken when the french make war in germany was already begun under the inspection of vauban such matters as were not in his department fell to the share of catinat then lieutenantgeneral a man capable of everything and formed for all exploits monseigneur arrived six days after the trenches had been opened he exactly observed his fathers conduct exposing his person as much as was necessary but never rashly treating everyone with affability and extending his liberality even to the private soldier the king felt a sincere joy in having a son who thus imitated without exceeding him and who made himself beloved by everyone without giving his father any occasion to fear him philippsburg was taken in nineteen days and mannheim in three frankenthal surrendered in two and spires trier worms and oppenheim     threw open their gates at the first approach of the french the king had resolved to make a desert of the palatinate as soon as those towns were taken his design in this was rather to cut off all means of subsistence from the enemy than to take vengeance on the elector whose only crime was that of having done his duty in joining with the rest of germany against france an order came to the army from the king signed louvois to reduce the whole country to ashes the french generals were then obliged to obey and though it was in the very midst of winter caused notice to be sent to the inhabitants of all these flourishing towns and the villages round about and to the masters of above fifty castles to quit their dwellings that they were going to destroy everything with fire and sword upon this dreadful summons men women old people and children hurried out in the utmost haste some of whom wandered up and down in the fields and the rest took refuge in neighboring countries while the soldiery who always exceed commands of rigor and seldom or never execute those of clemency burned and pillaged their country they began with mannheim the residence of the electors whose palaces they levelled to the ground as well as the private houses of the citizens broke open their very tombs thinking to satisfy their avarice with the immense treasures they expected to find there and scattered their ashes abroad this     was the second time that this beautiful country had been laid waste by louiss orders but the burning of two cities and twenty villages by turenne was but a spark in comparison to this conflagration all europe was struck with horror at this action the very officers who executed it were ashamed of being the instruments of such cruelty the blame was thrown on the marquis of louvois who had contracted that insensibility of heart which arises from a long administration he was certainly the person who advised this proceeding but louis had it in his power to reject or follow his counsel had the king been a witness to this spectacle he would have gone in person to extinguish the flames from his palace in versailles where he was surrounded by pleasures he signed the destruction of a whole country because he there beheld only his own glory and the fatal right of conquest in the order he gave but had he been nearer to the spot he would have seen all the horror of it the nations who till then had only blamed his ambition and admired his other qualifications now cried out against his cruelty and even condemned his politics for had his enemies penetrated into his dominions as he did into theirs they would have set all the cities in his kingdom on fire nor was this a very remote danger louis in covering his frontiers with one hundred thousand soldiers taught germany to make the same efforts this country being better peopled than france may be able to raise larger armies they have more     difficulty indeed in raising getting together and paying them and they are longer before they take the field but their strict discipline and patience under fatigues make them at the end of a campaign as formidable as the french are at the beginning the army of the empire was commanded by the duke of lorraine charles v this prince who was still kept out of his dominions by louis xiv had preserved the empire for leopold and given him the victory over the turks and hungarians he now came with the elector of brandenburg to put a check to the success of the french kings arms he retook bonn and mentz two towns which were very badly fortified but defended in a manner which was esteemed a model for the future defence of places bonn did not surrender till after a siege of nearly four months and the baron dasfeld who commanded there was mortally wounded in a general assault the marquis duxelles afterward marshal of france a most prudent and wary general had made such excellent dispositions for the defence of mentz that his garrison suffered hardly any fatigue in the great service it performed besides the care he took to provide for the safety of the place he made twentyone sallies on the enemy and killed over five thousand of their men he sometimes made one or two sallies in open daylight in short he maintained the place for seven weeks and surrendered at length only for want of powder this vigorous     defence deserves a place in history both on account of its own merit and the approbation it met with from the world paris that immense city whose indolent inhabitants pretend to judge of everything and who have so many ears and tongues with so few eyes looked upon duxelles as a timorous man and deficient in judgment when this great commander on whom every good officer will bestow just praise after his return from the campaign went to the theatre the populace hooted him and cried out mentz upon which he was obliged to retire not without heartily contemning as every wise man must a people who are such bad judges of merit and whose praise nevertheless is so greedily sought after about the same time—june     —marshal dhumières was beaten at walcourt on the sambre in the netherlands by the prince of waldeck but this check though it hurt his reputation very little affected the french arms louvois whose creature and friend he was found himself under the necessity of taking from him the command of this army which was conferred on marshal luxembourg whom neither the king nor louvois liked but their regard for the state got the better of their aversion to the man and they made use of his services though with some repugnance he was therefore appointed commander in the netherlands louvois was remarkable for correcting a too hasty choice or for making a good one catinat was sent with a command into     italy marshal de lorges defended himself everywhere in germany the duke de noailles had some little success in catalonia but under luxembourg in flanders and catinat in italy there was a continual succession of victories these two generals were at that time esteemed the greatest in europe the marshal duke of luxembourg in some parts of his character resembled the great condé whose pupil he was in the art of war he had a fiery genius a prompt execution a quick discernment a mind greedy for knowledge but too extensive and irregular he was continually engaged in intrigues with the ladies always in love and frequently beloved though deformed and illfavored and had more of the qualifications of a hero than a wise man catinat had an application and activity in his disposition that made him capable of everything though he never piqued himself upon any one particular qualification he would have been equally as good a minister and chancellor as he was a general in the earlier part of his life he followed the law but quitted that profession at the age of twentythree because he lost a cause in which he had justice on his side he then took up arms and was at first an ensign in the french guards in the year      at the attack on the counterscarp of lille he performed an action in the presence of the king which required both understanding and courage the king took notice of him and this was the beginning of his good fortune he rose by degrees without making any     interest he was a philosopher in the midst of war and grandeur those two fatal rocks to moderation exempt from all kind of prejudice without the affectation of appearing to despise them too much and an utter stranger to gallantry and the arts of courts but a sincere friend and an honest man he lived a professed foe to interest and vainglory and was equally the philosopher in all respects at the hour of his death that he was through the course of his life catinat commanded at that time in italy where he was opposed by victor amadeus duke of savoy who was then a wise politic and still more unfortunate prince a warrior of remarkable courage who always led his own armies and exposed his person like a common man no one better understood that deceitful kind of war which is carried on in a mountainous and uneven country such as his was he was active vigilant a lover of order but sometimes guilty of errors both as a prince and a general he is said to have committed an essential one in the bad manner in which he drew up his army in presence of that of catinat the french general took advantage of his mistake and gained a complete victory over him in sight of saluzzo near the abbey of stafarola from which that battle took its name when there are a number of men killed on one side and hardly any on the other it is a certain proof that the army which is beaten was drawn up on a ground where it must necessarily be overpowered the   0 french had only three hundred men killed and the allied army commanded by the duke of savoy more than four thousand after this battle all savoy except montmêlian submitted to the king catinat then marched into piedmont in      forced the enemys intrenchments near susa took that town together with villafranca montalban nice deemed impregnable veillano and carmagnola and returned to montmélian of which he made himself master after an obstinate siege after all these successes the ministry lessened the army which he commanded and the duke of savoy augmented his catinat inferior in numbers to his conquered enemy remained a long time on the defensive but at length having received reinforcements he descended the alps near marsala and there on oct        gained a second pitched battle which was the more glorious as prince eugene of savoy was then one of the enemys generals at the other extremity of france toward the netherlands marshal luxembourg gained the battle of fleurus and by the confession of all the officers this victory was entirely owing to the superiority of genius in the french general over prince waldeck who then commanded the allied army eight thousand men taken prisoners six thousand killed two hundred stands of colors almost all the cannon and baggage and the flight of the enemy were sufficient proofs of the victory king william had just returned from his victory     over his fatherinlaw this great genius ever fertile in resources made more advantage of the defeat of his party than the french often did of their victories he had been obliged to have recourse to intrigues and negotiations to procure men and money sufficient to oppose a king who had only to say i will nevertheless after the defeat at fleurus—sept        —he came to meet marshal luxembourg with an army as strong as that of the french they each consisted of about eighty thousand men but the marshal had already invested mons when william thought the french had hardly left their winter quarters louis himself came to be present at the siege and entered the town the ninth day after opening the trenches in sight of the enemys army after that he returned to versailles and left luxembourg to dispute the field during the whole campaign which ended with the battle of liège a very extraordinary action in which twentyeight squadrons of the kings household troops and the gendarmerie defeated seventyfive squadrons of the enemys army the king next repaired to the siege of namur the strongest place in the netherlands both by its situation which is at the confluence of the sambre and the meuse and by its citadel which is built on rocks he took the town in eight days and the castles in twentytwo while the duke of luxembourg prevented king william from passing the mehaigne at     the head of eighty thousand men to raise the siege after this conquest louis returned again to versailles and luxembourg still continued to make head against the enemys force now it was that the battle of steinkirk was fought so famous for the art and courage displayed therein a spy whom the french king had sent to watch the motions of king william was discovered and compelled before he was led to execution to write false information to marshal luxembourg who immediately upon receipt of this intelligence made such dispositions as must necessarily bring on a battle his army was attacked at daybreak while everyone was asleep and one entire brigade cut to pieces before the general knew anything of the matter without the extremest diligence and bravery all would have been lost it was not enough to be a great general to prevent a total defeat it likewise required welldisciplined troops capable of rallying in an instant general officers sufficiently skilful to recover these troops from the disorder into which they were thrown and willing to do their duty for a single officer of rank who had a mind to take advantage of the general confusion to cause his generals defeat might easily have done it without exposing himself to detection the marshal was then ill a fatal circumstance at a time when uncommon activity was required but the greatness of the danger restored him to his strength it was necessary to perform prodigies not     to be overcome and he performed them he changed his ground gave a field of battle to his army which before had none recovered the right wing which was all in confusion rallied his men three times and three times charged at the head of the household troops and all this in less than two hours he had with him in his army the duke of chartres afterward regent of the kingdom a grandson of france who was then not above fifteen years old he could be of no service in striking a decisive blow but it contributed not a little to animate the soldiers when they saw a grandson of france charging at the head of the kings household troops and though wounded in the fight returning again to the charge a grandson and grandnephew of the great condé both served in this army as lieutenantgenerals one of these was louis of bourbon called monsieur the duke and the other armand prince of conti both rivals in courage wit ambition and fame monsieur was of a more austere disposition and had perhaps more solid qualifications and the prince of conti more brilliant ones being both called by the public voice to the command of armies they earnestly longed for that honor which however they never obtained because louis who was as well acquainted with their ambition as their merit always remembered that the prince of condé had made war against him the prince of conti was the first who recovered the army from its confusion by rallying some of the     brigades and making the rest advance monsieur did just the same without standing in need of emulation the duke of vendôme grandson of henry iv was also a lieutenantgeneral in this army he had served ever since he was twelve years of age and though he was then over forty he had never yet commanded in chief his brother the grand prior was by his side it was necessary that all these princes should put themselves at the head of the kings household troops in order to drive a body of english from an advantageous post on which the success of the battle depended the french household troops and the english were the best troops in the world the slaughter was great but the french animated by the crowd of princes and young noblemen who fought about the generals person at length carried the post and when the english were defeated the rest were obliged to yield bouflers who was afterward marshal of france flew with a body of dragoons from a place where he was at some distance from the field of battle and his arrival completed the victory king william after having lost about seven thousand men retired in as good order as he had attacked and always beaten and always formidable he still kept the field this victory which was due to the valor of the young princes and the flower of the nobility of the kingdom produced an effect at court in the city     and in the provinces that no former victory had ever done monsieur the duke the prince of conti m de vendôme and their friends on their return home from this campaign found the roads lined with people whose acclamations and expressions of joy were carried even to a degree of madness the women all strove to attract their regard the men at that time wore lace cravats which took some time and pains to adjust the princes having dressed themselves in a hurry threw these cravats negligently about their necks the ladies wore handkerchiefs made in this fashion which they called steinkirks every new toy was a steinkirk any young man who happened to have been present at this battle was looked upon with delight the populace followed the princes everywhere in crowds and they were the more beloved because the court did not show them favor equal to their reputation and merit in the ensuing campaign the same general the same princes with the same troops who had been surprised and yet victorious at steinkirk made a forced march of seven leagues and came unexpectedly upon william at neerwinden and beat him neerwinden is a village near the layette a few leagues distant from brussels william had time to put his army in order of battle luxembourg and the princes carried the village sword in hand two different times and the instant the marshal turned another way the enemy retook it at length the general     and the princes carried it a third time and the battle was won on july         few actions proved more bloody there were about twenty thousand killed on both sides the allies lost twelve thousand and the french eight on this occasion it was said there was more room to sing de profundis than te deum these numerous victories were productive of much glory but few great advantages the allies though defeated at fleurus steinkirk and neerwinden had never been completely beaten king william always made fine retreats and in a fortnights time after one battle it was necessary to fight another with him to be master of the campaign the cathedral of paris was filled with colors taken from the enemy the prince of conti called marshal luxembourg the upholsterer of notre dame nothing was talked of but victories and yet louis xiv had formerly conquered onehalf of holland and flanders and all franchecomté without fighting a single battle whereas now after the greatest efforts and the most bloody victories they could hardly force an entrance into the united provinces they could not even lay siege to brussels marshal de lorges had also gained a considerable advantage over the allies near spirebach and had even taken the old duke of würtemberg prisoner and penetrated into his country but after having invaded it as a conqueror he was obliged to quit it again monseigneur took and plundered the city of     heidelberg a second time which the enemy had retaken and after all was obliged to act upon the defensive against the imperialists marshal catinat notwithstanding his great victory at stafarde and his having conquered savoy could not prevent the duke of that country from making an irruption into dauphiny nor after his victory at marsala could he save the important city of casale in spain marshal de noailles gained a battle on the banks of the ter on may         he took gironde and some small places but his army was weak and he was obliged after his victory to retire from before barcelona the french everywhere victorious and weakened by their successes had a hydra to engage in the allies that was continually rising up afresh france began to find it difficult to raise recruits and still more so to procure money the rigor of the season by which the fruits of the earth were at that time wholly destroyed brought on a famine numbers perished for want while the whole kingdom resounded with te deums and rejoicings the spirit of confidence and superiority which had been the soul of the french troops began visibly to diminish louis xiv no longer appeared at their head louvois was dead and barbésieux his son was generally disliked by them to crown all the death in january      of marshal luxembourg under whom they thought themselves invincible seemed to put an end to the rapid victories of the french     the art of bombarding towns with ships now turned upon its inventors not that the engine called infernal with which the english attempted to burn st malo and that failed of success was of french invention machines of this kind had been for a long time in use in europe it was the art of throwing bombs with as much certainty from a moving vessel as from the solid ground that the french invented and it was by this art that the english had from their ships bombarded the towns of dieppe havredegrâce st malo dunkirk and calais dieppe as being the most easy of access was the place which suffered the most damage this town which was now so delightful on account of the regularity of its buildings and which seems to owe its beauty to its misfortunes was almost reduced to ashes there were not above twenty houses beaten down and burned in havredegrâce but the fortifications of the place were entirely destroyed in this sense it is that the medal struck by the dutch is true notwithstanding that so many french writers have inveighed against its falsity in the exergue we find these words in latin the harbor of havre burned and destroyed etc this inscription does not tell us that the town was burned that would have been false it only says that the harbor was burned which is true soon afterward the french lost namur which they had taken the nation had lavished encomiums on louis xiv for having conquered this place     and the most indecent sallies had been thrown out against king william for not having succored it with an army of eighty thousand men william at length became master of it by the same manner in which it had been lost he attacked it in the face of an army much stronger than his own was at the time that louis xiv laid siege to it he now met with new fortifications of vaubans raising the french garrison which defended this town was an army of itself for while they were preparing matters to invest it marshal bouflers found means to throw himself into it with seven regiments of dragoons so that namur was not only defended by sixteen thousand men but was daily in expectation of being relieved by an army of a hundred thousand marshal bouflers had a great share of merit was an active and diligent general and a good citizen who had nothing so much at heart as the welfare of the service to promote which he valued neither his pains nor his life the marquis de feuquières in his memoirs accuses him of several faults in the defence of the town and citadel and even blames his conduct in the defence of lille by which he gained so much honor those who have written the history of louis xiv have servilely copied marquis de feuquières in military matters and abbé de choisi in private anecdotes they could not know that feuquières who was an excellent officer and perfectly well versed both in the theory and practice of war was of a disposition as morose as   0 discerning and sometimes the aristarchus sometimes the zoilus of generals he alters facts to have the pleasure of censuring he complains of everyone and everyone of him he was esteemed the bravest man in europe because he slept quietly in the midst of a hundred thousand of his enemies his merit not having been rewarded with the staff of marshal of france he employed his talents too much against the servants of the state which would have been extremely useful had he been as mild and charitable as he was discerning diligent and bold he charged marshal de villeroi with a greater number of faults and those more essential than even bouflers villeroi at the head of twenty thousand men was to have relieved namur but even had the two marshals villeroi and bouflers done everything generally speaking they might have done—which is very seldom the case—the situation of the ground was such that namur could not be relieved and must be taken sooner or later an army of observation posted along the banks of the mehaigne had prevented king william from bringing up his reinforcements the same thing now necessarily happened to marshal villeroi though marshal bouflers the count de guiscard governor of the town the count de laumont du châtelet commandant of the infantry and all the officers and soldiers in the place defended it with remarkable obstinacy and bravery it retarded the capitulation only two days when a town is besieged     by a superior army when the works are well carried on and the season favorable they can judge nearly within what time it will be taken be the defence ever so vigorous king william made himself master of the town and citadel in september      though not in so short a time as louis xiv the king while he was thus losing namur bombarded brussels a poor revenge which he took on the emperor for his towns which had been bombarded by the english all this occasioned a war equally ruinous and fatal to both parties one of the effects of human industry and fury of these two centuries past has been that of not confining the havoc of war to our own continent of europe we drain ourselves of men and money to carry destruction against each other in asia and america the indians whom we have compelled by force or artifice to admit our settlements among them and the americans from whom we have wrested their continent after having dyed it with their blood look upon us as the foes of humankind who came from the farthest part of the globe to butcher them and afterward to destroy one another the french had no other colony in the east indies but pondicherry which had been formed by colbert with great pains and at an immense expense and whence no considerable advantage could be drawn for several years the dutch easily made themselves masters of it and thus destroyed the trade of the french in the east indies almost in its infancy     our plantations in san domingo were destroyed by the english in      and one of the brest privateers laid waste theirs at gambia on the coast of africa the privateers of st malo carried fire and sword into the eastern part of newfoundland of which they were in possession and our squadrons insulted their island of jamaica took and burned their shipping there and ravaged the coast pointis commander of a squadron of ships of war and some privateers off america sailed as far as the line and surprised the town of cartagena the magazine and staple for the spanish treasures which come from mexico in may      the damage he did there was computed at twenty million livres and the booty he got at about half that sum there is always some deduction to be made from such calculations but little or none from the grievous calamities occasioned by these glorious expeditions the french privateers and especially duguaytrouin were every day making prizes of the english and dutch merchant ships this man was very extraordinary in his way and wanted only a numerous fleet to have acquired as great reputation as dragut or barbarossa the enemy made less rich prizes from the french because they had less to be taken our trade was greatly impaired by the death of colbert and the war a general misery was the result of these expeditions by sea and land those who delight more in humanity than politics will readily observe that in b     this war louis xiv took up arms against his brotherinlaw the king of spain against the elector of bavaria to whose sister he had married his son the dauphin and against the elector palatine whose country he ravaged though his brother was married to the princess palatine king james was driven from his throne by his soninlaw and his own daughter and since that time we have seen the duke of savoy in league against france where he had one daughter a dauphiness and against spain where another was queen most of the wars between christian princes are in some sort civil wars  the most criminal enterprise in all this war proved the only truly fortunate one william was perfectly successful in england and ireland in other places the successes were more equal when i call this a criminal undertaking i do not examine whether the nation after having shed the blood of the father were right or wrong in banishing the son and maintaining its religion and privileges i only say that if there is any justice on earth the daughter and soninlaw of king james should not have driven him from his throne and kingdom     chapter xvi treaty with savoy—marriage of the duke of burgundy—peace of ryswick—state of france and europe—death and last will of charles ii king of spain france still maintained her superiority over all her enemies some she had crushed as the duke of savoy and the elector palatine and she carried the war to the frontiers of the others like a powerful and robust body fatigued with long resistance and exhausted by its victories a welldirected blow would have made her stagger whoever has a number of enemies at once can at last find safety only in their division or in a peace louis xiv obtained both victor amadeus duke of savoy was a prince easily persuaded to break his engagements when his interest was concerned to him the court of france addressed itself the count de tessé afterward marshal of france an amiable and able man of a genius formed for pleasing which is the first qualification of a negotiator had begun a private treaty at turin and marshal catinat who was equally capable of making peace and war put the finishing hand to the affair there did not want two such able men to determine the duke of savoy to accept of what was to his advantage they restored him his country gave him a sum of money and proposed a marriage     between the young duke of burgundy son of the heir apparent of france and his daughter matters were soon agreed upon in july      the duke and catinat concluded the treaty at our lady of loretto whither they went under pretence of a pilgrimage of devotion which however imposed on no one pope innocent xiv entered heartily into this negotiation his view was to deliver italy at once from the invasions of the french and the taxes which the emperor was continually levying to pay his troops it was thought necessary that the imperialists should evacuate italy and leave it neutral this the duke of savoy engaged himself by the treaty to observe the emperor gave a flat denial at first for the court of vienna rarely came to a determination but at the last extremity upon the emperors refusal the duke joined his troops to the french army and from generalissimo to the emperor became in less than a month generalissimo to louis xiv his daughter who was only eleven years of age was carried into france to be married to the duke of burgundy who was thirteen after the defection of the duke of savoy it happened as at the peace of nimeguen that each of the allies thought proper to treat the emperor agreed to leave italy neutral the dutch proposed the castle of ryswick near the hague as the place for holding the conferences for a general peace four armies which the king had on foot contributed not a little to bring matters to a speedy conclusion there were     eighty thousand men in flanders under villeroi marshal de choiseul had forty thousand men on the banks of the rhine catinat had another army in piedmont and the duke of vendôme who had at length attained the rank of general after having passed through all the degrees from that of the kings guard like a private soldier of fortune commanded a body of troops in catalonia where he gained a battle and took barcelona these new efforts and successes proved the most effectual mediation the court of rome offered its arbitration which was refused as at nimeguen charles xi king of sweden was the mediator at length the peace was concluded in october      no longer with that haughty superiority and those advantageous conditions which had distinguished the greatness of louis xiv but with a condescension and concession of rights on his side that equally amazed the french and the allies it was long believed that this peace had been concerted with the deepest policy it was pretended that the french kings grand design was what it certainly should have been to prevent the entire succession of the vast spanish monarchy from devolving upon the other branch of the house of austria it is said he entertained hopes that the house of bourbon might at least come in for a share in the dismemberment and perhaps one day succeed to the whole the formal renunciations made by his wife and mother seemed no other than trivial agreements which should give way to new     conjunctures in this light to aggrandize the house of france it was necessary to show some moderation toward europe not to incense so many powers who were still full of suspicions the peace gave him time to form new alliances settle the finances gain over those whom he had occasion for and to form new bodies of militia in the kingdom it was necessary to give up something in hope of obtaining much more these were thought to be the private motives of the peace of ryswick which in the event actually procured the throne of spain for the grandson of louis xiv this notion probable as it may appear is not however true neither louis xiv nor his council had the views that they should have had in this affair it is a strong example of the connection of the revolutions in this world which govern men by whom they seem to be conducted the obvious interest of quickly possessing spain or at least a part of that monarchy had not the least influence in the peace of ryswick this is acknowledged by marquis de torci in his manuscript memoirs they made peace merely because they were weary of the war and this war itself had been carried on without any particular object at least on the side of the allies it was only from the idle desire of humbling the greatness of louis and in that monarch it was merely the consequence of that greatness which would not hearken to concessions king william had drawn over to his cause the emperor the empire     spain the united provinces and savoy louis xiv found himself too far engaged to recede the finest part of europe had been laid waste because the french king made use of the advantages he gained by the peace of nimeguen in too haughty a manner the league was formed rather against his person than the kingdom of france the king thought himself secure in the reputation he had gained by arms and was now desirous of adding that of moderation the weakness which began to be sensibly felt in the finances made him more ready to adopt such a method the political affairs were debated in the kings council and the resolutions taken there marquis de torci then young was only charged with the execution of them the whole council was for peace especially the duke of beauvilliers who set forth the miseries of the people with such energy that madame de maintenon was affected by it and the king himself appeared not insensible and it made the more impression as they had fallen from that flourishing state to which the minister colbert had raised the kingdom the great establishments of all kinds had cost immense sums and no economy had been used to retrieve the confusion occasioned by these extraordinary expenses this inward calamity astonished everyone because it had never been felt since louis xiv had governed alone these were the true causes of the peace of ryswick though doubtless some virtuous sentiments had an     influence in it those who think that kings and ministers incessantly and without bounds sacrifice everything to their ambition are no less mistaken than he who thinks they continually sacrifice to worldly happiness the king then restored to the spaniards all those places near the pyrenees that he had taken from them and likewise the conquests he had made in flanders during the last war as luxemburg mons ath and courtrai he acknowledged william iii lawful king of england whom he had till then treated as prince of orange a tyrant and an usurper he promised not to assist his enemies for the future and king james whose name was left out in the treaty remained at st germain with the empty title of king and a pension from louis xiv thus sacrificed by his protector to the necessity of the times and already forgotten in europe he ceased to publish any new manifestoes the sentences which the courts of breisach and metz had awarded against so many sovereigns and the reunions made at alsace those monuments of a dangerous power and pride were abolished and the bailiwicks that had been seized upon by form of law were restored to their right masters besides these concessions freiburg breisach kehl and philippsburg were restored to the empire the king even submitted to destroy the fortress of strasburg on the rhine fort louis traerbach and mount royal works on which the great vauban   0 had exhausted his art and the king his treasury europe was surprised and the french displeased to see louis xiv make peace as if he had been conquered harlai créci and callières who signed this peace dared not show themselves either at court or in the city they were loaded with reproaches and derision as if they had taken a single step they had not been ordered by the ministry they were reproached by the court with having betrayed the honor of the french nation and afterward they were applauded for having by this treaty prepared the way for the succession to the spanish monarchy but in truth they deserved neither censure nor praise it was by this peace that france at length restored lorraine to the family which had been in possession of it for more than seven hundred years duke charles v the prop of the empire and conqueror of the turks was dead his son leopold at the peace of ryswick took possession of his sovereignty with the loss indeed of his real privileges he not being allowed to have ramparts to his capital but they could not deprive him of a much more noble privilege that of doing good to his subjects a privilege of which no prince ever made a better use than himself it were to be wished that latest posterity may be informed that one of the least powerful sovereigns in europe was he who did the most good to his people he found lorraine a desert waste he repeopled and enriched it and preserved it in peace     while the rest of europe was desolated by war he had always the prudence to keep well with france and to make himself beloved in the empire happily preserving that just medium which hardly any prince without power has ever been able to maintain between two great potentates he procured his people plenty to which they long had been strangers his noblesse reduced to the last degree of wretchedness were raised to a state of opulence solely by his benefactions if he saw the family seat of a gentleman in ruins he rebuilt it at his own expense he paid their debts portioned out their daughters and lavished presents with that art of giving which raises them even above benefactions bestowing his gifts with the magnificence of a prince and the politeness of a friend the arts which were held in the highest honor throughout his little province produced a new circulation which makes the riches of a state his court was formed after the model of that of france and the traveller hardly perceived a change of place in going to lunéville from versailles after the example of louis xiv he advanced the belleslettres he established a kind of university without pedantry at lunéville where the young german nobility went to be formed the true sciences were there taught in schools where the theory of natural philosophy was demonstrated to the eye by the most curious apparatus he sought out men of talents even in the shops and in the woods brought them to light and was himself their patron and rewarder     in a word the whole business of his reign was to procure his nation tranquillity riches knowledge and pleasure i would quit my sovereignty tomorrow said he if i could no longer do good accordingly he tasted the satisfaction of being beloved and i myself saw long after his death his subjects shed tears in mentioning his name when he died he left an example to be followed by the greatest kings but he could not during his life be instrumental in preparing the way for his son to the throne of the empire at the time that louis xiv was managing the affair of the peace of ryswick which was to give him the spanish succession the throne of poland became vacant this was the only regal crown then elective in the world natives and foreigners had equally a right to pretend to it but to retain it required either a merit sufficiently striking and properly supported by intrigues to engage the suffrages—as was the case with john sobieski the late king—or else money enough to buy the kingdom which is almost always put up at auction the abbé afterward cardinal polignac had at first the art to engage the suffrages in favor of the prince of conti known by the valiant actions he had performed at steinkirk and neerwinden he never had the command in chief nor was he admitted into the kings councils the duke of bourbon had an equal reputation as a warrior the duke of vendôme a still greater and yet his fame surpassed that of all     others by the great art of pleasing and making himself of consequence which no one possessed in a more eminent degree than himself polignac whose talent lay in persuasion determined the minds of the people in his favor and by dint of eloquence and promises counterbalanced the money which augustus elector of saxony lavished among them louis francis prince of conti was elected king by the majority of the nation and proclaimed by the primate of the kingdom on june         augustus was elected two hours afterward by another party inferior in numbers but he was a sovereign prince and powerful and had a body of troops in readiness on the frontiers of poland the prince of conti was absent destitute of money men and power and had nothing on his side but his name and cardinal de polignac it was necessary that louis xiv should either prvent his accepting the crown or furnish him with proper assistance to get the better of his competitor it was thought that the french ministry did too much in sending the prince of conti over and too little in furnishing him with only a small squadron of ships and a few bills of exchange with which he arrived in the road of dantzic this was acting with that lukewarm policy which begins an affair only to quit it again they would not even receive the prince at dantzic and his bills of exchange were protested the intrigues of the pope and the emperor and the money and troops of saxony had already secured the crown on his     rivals head he returned then with the glory of having been chosen king and france had the mortification of having made it appear that she was not sufficiently powerful to make a king of poland this disgrace which befell the prince of conti did not interrupt the peace which subsisted between the christian powers of the north the south of europe was soon afterward restored to its tranquillity by the peace of ryswick there was no longer any war but that which the turks carried on against germany poland venice and russia and here the christians though under a bad administration and divided among themselves had the superiority the battle of zenta in      in which prince eugene beat the grand seignior in person and remarkable by the deaths of the grand vizier seventeen pashas and upward of twenty thousand turks humbled the ottoman pride and brought about the peace of carlowitz in      in which the turks submitted to the laws imposed by the conquerors the venetians had the morea the muscovites azov the poles kamenetspodolski and the emperor transylvania all christendom was then happy and tranquil the sound of war was no longer heard either in asia or africa and the whole world was at peace during the last two years of the seventeenth century an epoch alas of too short duration the public calamities were soon awakened again the peace of the north was disturbed in the year       00 by two men the most extraordinary the world ever produced one was czar peter alexeievitch emperor of russia the other young charles xii king of sweden czar peter though born a barbarian became a great man and by his genius and surprising labors was the reformer or rather founder of his empire charles xii more courageous than the czar and yet less serviceable to his subjects formed to command soldiers but not nations was the first hero of his age but died with the character of an imprudent king the desolation the north underwent during a war of eighteen years owed its rise to the ambitious politics of the czar and the kings of denmark and poland who wanted to take advantage of the youth of charles xii to strip him of a part of his dominions but charles at the age of sixteen conquered all three he was the terror of the world and was already esteemed a hero at an age in which other men have hardly finished their studies he was for nine years the most formidable monarch in the world and for nine years the most miserable the troubles of the south arose from another cause the king of spain lay at the point of death and it was in dispute who should share the spoils he was to leave behind him the powers who already devoured in imagination this immense succession did on this occasion what we frequently see practised during the illness of a rich old man who has no children the wife the relatives     the priests of the sick king and even the officers appointed to receive the last commands of those who are dying beset him on all sides to get a favorable word from him some of the inheritors agree to divide the spoils and others prepare to dispute them louis xiv and the emperor leopold were both grandsons of philip iii and both had married daughters of philip iv therefore monseigneur the dauphin the kings son and joseph king of the romans son of the emperor were doubly in the same degree the right of eldership was in the house of france the king and monseigneur being sons of the elder daughters but the imperial house reckoned as rights first the formal renunciation to the crown of spain made and ratified by louis xiii and louis xiv with the name of austria the blood of maximilian whence leopold and charles ii were descended the almost perpetual union which had subsisted between the two branches of the house of austria the still more constant hatred of those two branches against the bourbons the aversion which the spanish nation had at that time to the french and lastly the secret springs of the policy which governed the spanish council nothing at that time seemed more natural than to perpetuate the throne of spain in the house of austria all europe expected this before the peace of ryswick but the weakness of charles ii had disturbed this order of succession in the year          and the austrian house had been already sacrificed in secret the king of spain had a grandnephew son of the elector of bavaria the kings mother who was still living was greatgrandmother of this young prince of bavaria who was then about four years old and this princess notwithstanding that she herself was of the house of austria being a daughter of emperor ferdinand iii prevailed on her son to disinherit the imperial family in consequence of a pique she had entertained against the court of vienna she therefore cast her eyes on the prince of bavaria though hardly out of his cradle and destined him for the spanish monarchy and that of the new world charles ii who was then entirely governed by her made a private will in the year      in favor of the electoral prince of bavaria but having afterward lost his mother he was governed by his wife mariana of bavaria neuburg this bavarian princess who was a sisterinlaw of the emperor leopold had as great an attachment to the house of austria as the austrian queenmother had to that of bavaria thus the natural course of things was all along inverted in this affair which concerned the most extensive monarchy in the world mariana of bavaria procured the destruction of that will by which the young prince of bavaria was called to the succession and obtained a promise from the king that he would never have any other heir than a son of the emperor leopold and would not name the house of austria     matters were on this footing at the peace of ryswick the kings of france and austria were equally fearful and suspicious of each other and had likewise europe to fear england and holland two powerful states whose interest it was to maintain the balance of power between crowned heads would never consent that the head which wore the crown of spain should wear that of france or the empire it is not positively known who it was that first conceived the notion of making the premature and unheardof partition of the spanish monarchy during the lifetime of charles ii most probably it was the minister torci for it was he who first opened it to bentinck earl of portland ambassador from william iii to louis xiv king william entered with great alacrity into this new project and in concert with the count de tallard at the hague disposed of the spanish succession to the young prince of bavaria they gave spain and the east indies without knowing that charles ii had before that bequeathed to him all his dominions the dauphin son of louis xiv was to have naples sicily and the province of guipuzcoa together with some few towns the archduke charles second son of the emperor leopold had only the duchy of milan given him and nothing was allotted for the archduke joseph leopolds eldest son and heir to the empire the destiny of a part of europe and the half of     america thus settled louis promised by this treaty of partition to renounce the entire succession to the spanish dominions the dauphin promised and signed the same thing france thought to make an addition to its territories england and holland had in view the settlement of peace of a part of europe but all these politics were vain the dying king being informed how they were tearing his monarchy in pieces during his lifetime was filled with indignation it was generally expected that upon hearing this news he would declare either the emperor or one of his sons his successor as a reward for his not having intermeddled in this shameful partition and that he would make such a will as the house of austria should dictate to him he did indeed make a will but he a second time declared the prince of bavaria sole heir to his dominions the spanish nation who dreaded nothing so much as the dismembering of its monarchy applauded the disposition the king had made which seemed calculated to bring about a peace this hope proved as vain as the treaty of partition the prince of bavaria the intended king died at brussels the house of austria was unjustly charged with the sudden death of this prince merely from the probability that those to whom the crimes are useful will be guilty of crimes and new intrigues began to be revived again at the courts of madrid vienna versailles london the hague and rome louis xiv king william and the statesgeneral   0 disposed once more of the spanish monarchy in idea in march   0  and assigned to archduke charles the emperors youngest son that part which they had before given to the infant lately dead they gave milan to the duke of lorraine and lorraine so often invaded and so often restored again to france was to be annexed to it forever this treaty which set the politics of all the princes at work to thwart or support it proved as useless as the first europe was again deceived in its attempt as almost always happens when this treaty of partition was offered to the emperor to sign he refused because he hoped to get the entire succession the french kings who had strongly pressed the signing of it waited in uncertainty for the event the king of spain who saw himself at the point of death in the flower of his age was for bestowing all his dominions on the archduke charles his queens nephew and second son of the emperor leopold he did not dare to leave them to the eldest son so prevalent was the system of a balance of power in all minds and so certain was it that the apprehension of seeing spain the indies the empire hungary bohemia and lombardy in the same hands he was about to arm all europe charles ii wanted the emperor leopold to send his second son charles to madrid at the head of ten thousand men but neither france england the statesgeneral nor italy would have permitted such a     step to be taken at that time everyone was for the partition the emperor would not send his son alone to be at the mercy of the spanish council and he could not transport ten thousand men thither he only wanted to march troops into italy to secure that part of the austrianspanish monarchy there now happened in the most important of concerns between two great princes what happens every day between private persons in the most trifling affairs they disputed they grew warm the castilian haughtiness was offended by the german pride the countess of perlitz who governed the wife of the dying king alienated the minds of those in madrid whom she should have won over and the court of vienna disgusted them still more by its haughtiness the young archduke who was afterward emperor charles vi never mentioned the spaniards but with some opprobrious appellation he then experienced how incumbent it is on princes to weigh all their words the bishop of lérida who was ambassador from the court of madrid to that of vienna on some occasion of dislike against the germans collected these expressions and transmitted them with exaggerations to his court in his despatches and even treated the austrian council more injuriously in his letters than the archduke had done the spaniards by his speeches leopolds ministers said he have understandings like the horns of the goats in my country small hard and crooked this letter was made public the bishop of lérida was     recalled and on his return to madrid he doubly increased the aversion which his countrymen had to the germans while the austrian party made itself thus hated by the court of madrid the marquis afterward marshal duke dharcourt the french ambassador gained all hearts by his prodigious magnificence his dexterity and perfect knowledge in the art of pleasing he was the first who changed into benevolence that antipathy which the spanish nation had nourished against the french ever since the reign of ferdinand the catholic and by his prudent conduct laid the foundation for that period when france and spain renewed the ancient bonds by which they were united before the time of that ferdinand crown with crown nation with nation and man with man he brought the spanish court to have an affection for the house of france its ministers to be no longer startled at the renunciations made by maria theresa and anne of austria and the king himself to waver between his own house and that of bourbon he was therefore the primum mobile of the greatest change in the administration and the minds of the people in general but this change was yet at a considerable distance the emperor employed entreaties and threats the king of france represented his rights but without venturing to ask the entire succession for his grandson the council of madrid were as yet undetermined which side to take and charles ii who was every     day drawing nearer to his grave was in equal uncertainty leopold in a pique recalled his ambassador the count de harrach from madrid but soon afterward he sent him back again and then the hopes in favor of the house of austria were revived the king of spain wrote to the emperor that he would choose the archduke for his successor then the french king threatened in his turn assembled an army on the frontiers of spain and the marquis dharcourt was recalled from his embassy to command these forces leaving only an officer of foot at the court of madrid who had served as secretary to the embassy and now remained in quality of resident as de torci tells us thus the dying king threatened alternately by those who pretended to the succession and plainly perceiving that the hour of his death would be that of a bloody war and that his dominions were on the point of being torn in pieces drew toward his end comfortless irresolute and involved in disquietudes in this violent crisis of affairs cardinal portocarrero archbishop of toledo the count of monterey and others of the spanish grandees determined to save their country and joined together to prevent the dismembering of the monarchy their hatred of the austrian government added a double weight to reasons of state in their breasts and did the court of france the most essential service without her knowing it they persuaded charles ii to prefer the grandson of louis xiv to a prince at so great     a distance from them and incapable of defending them this was not an invalidation of the solemn renunciations of the spanish crown made by the mother and wife of louis xiv because these had been made only to prevent the elder sons of their descendants from uniting the two kingdoms under one rule and here it was an elder son that was chosen it was at the same time doing justice to the rights of blood and preserving the spanish monarchy from a partition the scrupulous king caused all his divines to be consulted on this head who were all of opinion with the council and ill as he was wrote a letter with his own hand to pope innocent xii proposing the same case to him the pope who thought the liberty of italy depended upon the weakening of the house of austria wrote back to the king that the laws of spain and the good of christendom required of him to give the preference to the house of france this letter of the popes was dated july      00 he treated this case of conscience proposed by a sovereign as an affair of state while the king of spain made a case of conscience of an important affair of state louis xiv was informed of these dispositions by cardinal de janson who then resided at rome and this was all the share that the court of versailles had in this event six months had passed without there being any ambassador at the court of madrid this was perhaps a fault but perhaps also this very fault secured the spanish monarchy in the house of     france the king of spain then made his third will that was for a long time thought to be the only one by which he bequeathed all his dominions to the duke of anjou it was generally thought in europe that this will of charles ii had been dictated at versailles the dying king consulted only the interest of his kingdom and the wishes and even fears of his people for the french king had ordered his troops to advance to the frontiers in order to secure to himself a part of the inheritance at the time the dying king determined to leave him the whole nothing is more true than that the reputation of louis xiv and the notion of his power were the only negotiations that completed this great revolution charles of austria after having signed the ruin of his house and the aggrandizement of that of france languished about a month longer when he ended at the age of thirtynine the obscure life he had led while on the throne it may perhaps not be altogether useless toward giving an insight into the human mind to mention that this monarch a few months before his death caused the tombs of his mother and his first wife maria louisa of orleans to the poisoning of whom he was suspected to have been privy to be opened and kissed the remains of their dead bodies in this he either followed the example of some of the ancient kings of spain or was willing to accustom himself to the horrors of death or from a secret superstition     thought that opening these tombs would retard the hour in which he was to be carried to his own this prince was from his birth as weak in mind as body and this weakness had spread itself through his dominions it is the fate of monarchies to have their prosperity depend upon the disposition of a single man charles ii had been brought up in such profound ignorance that when the french were beseiging mons he thought that place had belonged to the king of england he neither knew whereabouts flanders lay nor what place belonged to him there this king left the duke of anjou all his dominions without knowing what he had given him his will was kept so secret that the count de harrach the emperors ambassador still flattered himself that the archduke would be acknowledged his successor he waited a long time for the issue of the great council which was held immediately upon the kings death at length seeing the duke of abrantes coming toward him with open arms he made sure in that instant that the archduke was king and when the duke embraced him accosted him thus vengo á expedirme de la casa de austria—i am come to take leave of the house of austria thus after two hundred years of war and negotiations for some few frontier towns of the spanish dominions the house of france by the single stroke of a pen was put in possession of the whole monarchy     without treaties without intrigues and even without having entertained hopes of the succession we thought ourselves obliged to bring to light the simple truth of a fact which has till now been obscured by so many statesmen and historians led away by their own prejudices and by appearances that are almost always fallacious what we find related in a number of books concerning the sums of money distributed by marshal dharcourt and the bribing of the spanish ministers to get this will signed may be ranked in the number of political lies and popular errors but the king of spain in choosing for his successor the grandson of a king who had so long been his enemy had always in view the consequences that naturally follow from a notion of a general equilibrium of power the duke of anjou louis xivs grandson was called to the spanish succession only because he could never pretend to the crown of france and in this very will by which in default of younger children of the blood of louis xiv the archduke charles—afterward the emperor charles vi—is called to the succession it is expressly declared that the empire and spain shall never be united under one sovereign louis xiv might still have abided by the treaty of partition which was profitable for france or he might have accepted the will which was to the advantage of his family this matter was actually in debate in an extraordinary council held nov      00 the chancellor pontchartrain and the duke     of beauvilliers were for abiding by the treaty as they foresaw the danger of having a new war to support louis saw nothing like this but he was accustomed not to fear war he therefore accepted the will and as he was coming out of the council meeting the princess of conti with madame the duchess well said he to them smiling on which side are you and then without giving them time to reply whichsoever side i take added he i am sure to be blamed the actions of kings though often extravagantly flattered are also liable to the severest strictures insomuch that the king of england himself underwent the reproaches of his parliament and his ministers were prosecuted for having been concerned in the treaty of partition the english who reason better than any other nation but who frequently suffer the rage of party spirit to extinguish that reason exclaimed unanimously against william who had made this treaty and against louis who had broken it europe at first seemed lost in surprise and unable to bestir itself when it saw the spanish monarchy become subject to france whose rival it had been for over three hundred years louis xiv seemed the most fortunate and powerful monarch in the world he saw himself at the age of sixtytwo surrounded with a numerous posterity and one of his grandsons going to rule under his orders the kingdom of spain america one half of italy and the low     countries the emperor as yet could do nothing but complain king william now fiftytwo years of age infirm and feeble no longer appeared the formidable enemy he had been he could not make war without the consent of his parliament and louis had taken care to send sums of money over to england with a view to purchasing several votes in that assembly william and the dutch not being strong enough to declare themselves wrote to philip v as to the lawful king of spain louis xiv was sure of the elector of bavaria this elector who governed the netherlands in the name of the deceased king charles ii immediately secured the possession of flanders to philip v and left a passage open for the french army through his electorate to the capital of germany in case the emperor should venture to declare war the elector of cologne brother of the elector of bavaria was as intimately connected with france as his brother and these two princes seemed to act with reason on their side the party of the house of bourbon was at that time the strongest the duke of savoy fatherinlaw of the duke of burgundy and prospective fatherinlaw of the king of spain was to have the command of the french forces in italy it was hardly imagined then that the father of the duchess of burgundy and the queen of spain would ever make war upon his two sonsinlaw the duke of mantua who had been sold to france   0 by his minister now sold himself and received a french garrison into mantua the duchy of milan acknowledged louiss grandson without hesitation and even portugal who was naturally the enemy of spain immediately joined with it in a word from gibraltar to antwerp and from the danube to naples all seemed to be at the disposal of the bourbons the king was so elated with his prosperity that talking with the duke de la rochefoucauld one day on the subject of the proposals which the emperor made him at that time he expressed himself thus you will find them still more insolent than you have been told king william who to the hour of his death continued an enemy to louis xiv promised the emperor to arm england and holland in his cause he likewise engaged the court of denmark in his interest at length in september   0  he signed at the hague that league which had been already set on foot against the house of france the king however was not much surprised at this and depending upon the divisions he hoped to cause in the english parliament by the money he had sent over and still more on the united forces of france and spain seemed to despise his enemies at this time king james died at st germain louis might on this occasion have paid what appeared due to decency and good politics in not too hastily acknowledging the prince of wales for king of england after having already acknowledged     williams title by the peace of ryswick he was at first determined from an emotion of pure generosity to give the son of king james the consolation of a title and dignity which his unfortunate father had borne till the hour of his death and which the treaty of ryswick did not take from him the principal ministers of the council however were of a different opinion the duke of beauvilliers especially set forth in the most eloquent manner the many scourges of war which were likely to be the consequence of so dangerous a magnanimity this nobleman was governor to the duke of burgundy and in everything thought like that princes preceptor the famous archbishop of cambray so well known by his humane maxims of government and the preference he gave to the interests of the people over the grandeur of the monarch the marquis de torci enforced as a politician what the duke de beauvilliers had advanced as a citizen he represented how impolitic it was to incense the english nation by so rash a step louis yielded to the opinions of his council and resolved not to acknowledge the son of james ii as king the same day mary of modena widow of the deceased james went to madame de maintenons apartments to speak with louis xiv she found him there and with a flood of tears conjured him not to treat her son herself and the memory of a king he had protected with so much indignity as to refuse a title the only remains of all their former greatness she observed that as     her son had always received the honors of a prince of wales he ought to be treated as king after the death of his father and that even william himself could not complain of this provided he was left to enjoy his usurpation to these arguments she added others which concerned the interest and glory of louis xiv she represented to him that whether he acknowledged the son of james ii or not the english would nevertheless declare against france and that he would only feel the vexation of having sacrificed the most noble sentiments to a fruitless precaution these representations and tears were powerfully seconded by madame de maintenon the king resumed his former sentiments and the noble resolution of protecting distressed kings to the utmost of his power in a word james iii was acknowledged the same day that it had been determined in council not to acknowledge him the marquis de torci has frequently owned this remarkable anecdote he has not indeed inserted it in his memoirs because as he himself observes he thought it was not to the honor of his master to be prevailed upon by two women to alter a resolution which had been taken in his council some english gentlemen have told me that had it not been for this step their parliament might not perhaps have taken part against the houses of bourbon and austria but that this acknowledging as their king a person whom they had banished appeared an insult offered to the nation and an attempt toward exercising     an absolute authority over europe the spirit of freedom which then prevailed among the english which was not a little increased by the hatred they bore to louis on account of his great power made the nation contribute with cheerfulness to all the supplies which william demanded it appears more probable that the english would have declared war against louis xiv even though he had refused the empty title of king to the son of james ii his grandsons being in possession of the spanish monarchy seemed alone sufficient to arm all the maritime powers against him a few members of the house of commons bribed to favor his cause could never have opposed the torrent of the nation it remains to be decided whether madame de maintenon judged better than the french council and whether louis xiv was in the right to indulge the pride and sensibility of his soul the emperor leopold first began this war in italy in the spring of the year   0  italy has always been the favorite object in all the concerns of the emperors he knew his arms could more easily penetrate here through the tyrolese and the venetian states for venice though neutral in appearance still inclined more to the house of austria than to that of france and moreover being obliged by treaties to allow a passage to the german troops she found no great difficulty in accomplishing these treaties the emperor before he ventured to attack louis xiv on the side of germany waited till the germanic     body began to stir in his favor he had correct reports from the spanish court and even a party there but neither of these could prove of service without the presence of one of his sons and he could not be transported thither but with the assistance of the english and dutch fleets king william hastened the necessary preparations his soul more active than ever in a feeble and almost lifeless body set everything in motion not so much with a view to serving the house of austria as to humbling louis xiv he was to have headed the armies himself at the beginning of the year   0  but death prevented his design a fall from his horse completed the disorder of his enfeebled organs and a slight fever carried him off march      0  he died without making any reply to what the english clergymen who attended at his bedside said to him in relation to their religion and showed no concern but for the affairs of europe he left behind him the character of a great politician though he was never popular and a formidable general though he had lost so many battles always circumspect in his conduct and spirited only in the day of battle he reigned peaceably in england merely because he did not attempt to be absolute he was called the english stadtholder and the dutch king he understood all the european languages but spoke none of them well as he had a much greater share of reflection than imagination     he affected to hate flatterers and flattery perhaps because louis xiv seemed to take rather too much pleasure in them his reputation was of a different kind from that of the french monarch those who admired most the advantage of having acquired a kingdom without any natural right and of maintaining the rule over a people without being beloved by them of having governed holland with all the authority of a sovereign without enslaving it of having been the soul and head of half of europe without possessing the talents of a general or the courage of a soldier of never having persecuted anyone on the score of religion of having a contempt for the superstitious prejudices of mankind of having been simple and moderate in his manners such i say will doubtless give the title of great to william rather than to louis while those who are more delighted with the pleasures of a brilliant court with magnificence with the protection given to the arts with a zeal for the public good a thirst for glory and a talent for reigning who are more struck with the lofty manner in which ministers and generals added whole provinces to france only on an order from their king who are more astonished to see a single state prevail against so many powers who have greater esteem for a king of france who procures the kingdom of spain for his grandson than for a soninlaw who dethrones his wifes father in a word those who admire more the protector     than the persecutor of king james will give louis the preference william iii was succeeded by princess anne daughter of king james by the daughter of lawyer hyde afterward chancellor and one of the principal men of the kingdom she was married to the prince of denmark who ranked only as the first subject in the kingdom as soon as she came to the crown she adopted all the measures of her predecessor king william though she had been at open variance with him during his life these measures were those of the nation in other kingdoms a prince obliges his people to enter blindly into all his views but in england a king must enter into those of his people the dispositions made by england and holland for placing if possible the archduke charles son of the emperor leopold on the throne of spain or at least to oppose the establishment of the bourbon family were such as perhaps may be said to merit the attention of all ages the dutch on their side were to maintain an army of one hundred and two thousand men in pay either in garrison or in the field this was much more than the vast spanish monarchy could furnish at that time a province of merchants who thirty years before had been almost totally subdued in the space of two months could now do more than the masters of spain naples flanders peru and mexico england promised to furnish forty thousand men it happens in most alliances that in the     long run the parties concerned fall short of their promised quotas but england on the contrary furnished fifty thousand men the second year instead of forty which she had promised and in the latter part of the war she had to pay on the frontiers of france in spain italy ireland america and on board her fleet more than one hundred and twenty thousand fighting men soldiers and sailors partly her own troops partly those of her allies an expense which appears almost incredible to those who reflect that england properly so called is not a third as large as france and has not half the quantity of coin but will appear probable in the eyes of those who know what trade and credit can do the english always bore the greatest share of the burden in this alliance while the dutch insensibly lessened theirs for after all the republic of the statesgeneral is only an illustrious trading company whereas england is a fruitful country abounding in merchants and soldiers the emperor was to furnish eighty thousand men exclusive of the troops of the empire and those allies whom he hoped to detach from the house of bourbon and yet the grandson of louis xiv was already seated peaceably on his throne at madrid and louis at the beginning of the century was at the zenith of his power and glory but those who penetrated into the resources of the several courts of europe and especially that of france began to fear some reverse spain which had been weakened     under the last kings of the race of charles v was still more feeble during the early part of the reign of the bourbons the house of austria had partisans in several provinces of this monarchy catalonia seemed ready to shake off the new yoke and acknowledge the archduke charles it was impossible that portugal sooner or later should not side with the house of austria it was plainly to its interest to encourage a civil war among the spaniards its natural enemies that might turn to the advantage of lisbon the duke of savoy lately become fatherinlaw to the new king of spain and linked to the bourbons by ties of blood as well as by treaties seemed already displeased with his sonsinlaw fifty thousand crowns a month afterward raised to two hundred thousand francs did not appear a sufficiently valuable consideration to bind him to their interest he wanted montferrat mantua and a part of the duchy of milan the haughty treatment he met with from the french generals and from the ministry at versailles made him apprehensive and not without reason that he should soon be held for nothing by his two sonsinlaw who kept his dominions surrounded on every side he had already quitted the emperor for france without any ceremony and it seemed more than probable that finding himself so little regarded by the latter he would change sides the first opportunity as to the court of louis xiv and his kingdom     discerning spirits already perceived a change in them which is only visible to the grosser ones when the decline is far advanced the king now over sixty years of age was more retired and consequently knew less of mankind he saw things at too great a distance and with eyes less discerning and dazzled with prosperity madame de maintenon with all the amiable qualities of which she was mistress had neither the strength greatness nor courage of mind requisite for supporting the glory of a state she was instrumental in procuring the management of the finances in      and the department of war in   0  for her creature chamillard who was more of the honest man than the minister and had ingratiated himself with the king by his discreet conduct when employed at st cyr but notwithstanding an outward appearance of modesty he had the misfortune to think himself capable of bearing two burdens which colbert and louvois had with difficulty supported separately the king depending on his own experience thought that he could successfully direct his ministers and when louvois died he said to king james i have lost a good minister but neither your affairs nor mine shall go the worse for it when he made choice of barbésieux to succeed louvois as secretary of war he said to him i formed your father and i will form you he expressed himself much in the same manner to chamillard a king who had been so long engaged in public affairs and with such  00 great success seemed to have a right to talk in this manner in regard to the generals whom he employed they were frequently confined by the strict orders they received from him like ambassadors who must not depart from their instructions he and chamillard directed the operations of the campaign in madame de maintenons closet if a general was desirous of executing any great undertaking he was frequently obliged to despatch a courier to court for permission who at his return found the opportunity lost or the general beaten military rewards and dignities were profusely lavished under chamillards administration numbers of young persons hardly out of their leadingstrings were allowed to purchase regiments which with the enemy was the reward of twenty years service this difference was very sensibly felt on many occasions in which an experienced officer might have prevented a total rout the cross of the knights of st louis a reward invented by the king in      and then the object of emulation among the officers was exposed to sale in the beginning of chamillards ministry and could be bought for fifty crowns apiece at any of the war offices military discipline the soul of service which had been so strictly kept up by louvois had degenerated into a fatal remissness the companies were not complete in their number of men nor the regiments in their officers hence arose a defect which supposing  0  an equality in other respects must infallibly occasion the loss of all their battles for to have an equal extent of front with that of the enemy they were obliged to oppose weak battalions to strong and numerous ones the magazines were no longer so well provided nor at such convenient distances nor were the arms so well tempered as formerly those therefore who perceived these defects in the administration and knew what generals france had to deal with trembled for her even in the midst of those first advantages which seemed to promise her greater success than ever i  ii voltaire age of louis xiv vol xii—part ii iii iv v vi vii   chapter xvii the war of   0 —conduct of prince eugene marshal villeroi the duke of vendôme the duke of marlborough and marshal villars until the year   0  the first general to put a check to the superiority of the french arms was a frenchman for so we should call prince eugene though he was the grandson of charles emanuel duke of savoy his father the count de soissons had settled in france where he was lieutenantgeneral of the kings armies and governor of champagne and had married olympia mancini one of the nieces of cardinal mazarin from this match so unfortunate in other respects was born this prince who afterward proved so dangerous an adversary to louis xiv and was so little known to him in his youth he was known at first in france by the name of the chevalier de carignan he afterward took the petit collet and was called the abbot of savoy it is said that he asked the king for a regiment which his majesty refused him on account of his being too much connected   with the princes of conti who were then in disgrace not being able to succeed with louis xiv he went to serve the emperor against the turks in hungary in      together with the princes of conti who had already made a glorious campaign there the king sent an order to the princes of conti and all those who had accompanied them in this expedition to return home the abbot of savoy was the only one who refused to comply with this mandate he continued his journey openly declaring that he renounced france forever the king when he was told of this said to his courtiers dont you think i have had a great loss and these gentlemen gave it as their opinion that the abbot of savoy would always be a madheaded fellow and fit for nothing they founded their judgment on certain sallies of youth by which we are never to judge of men this prince who was held in so much contempt at the court of france was born with all the qualifications which form the hero in war and the great man in peace he had a just and lofty mind and the necessary courage both in the field and cabinet he was guilty of faults as all generals have been but these were lost in the number of his great actions he shook the greatness of louis xiv and the ottoman power he governed the empire and in the course of his victories and ministry showed an equal contempt for vainglory and riches he cherished and even protected learning as much as could be done at the court of vienna at   this time he was about thirtyseven years of age and had the experience of his own victories over the turks and the faults which he had seen committed by the imperialists in the late wars in which he served against france he entered italy by the country of trent in the territories of venice with thirty thousand men and with full liberty to make such use of them as he pleased the court at first forbade marshal catinat to oppose the passage of prince eugene either because they would not commit the first act of hostility which was bad policy when the enemy had already taken up arms or else because they would not disoblige the venetians who were however less to be feared than the german army this first mistake in the court occasioned marshal catinat to commit others that person rarely succeeds who follows a plan that is not his own besides we well know how difficult a matter it is in a country cut through with rivers and streams toprevent a skilful enemy from passing them prince eugene to a great depth of scheming added a lively promptitude of execution from the nature of the ground on the banks of the adige the enemys army was more compact while that of the french was more extended catinat was for marching to meet the enemy but the generals started difficulties and formed cabals against him instead of making them obey him he gave way the mildness of his disposition led him to commit this great error eugene began on july     0  by forcing the post of carpi   near the white canal which was defended by st fremont who neglected the generals orders in some respects and occasioned his own defeat after this success the german army had the command of all the country between the adige and the adda and penetrated into bressan while catinat retreated behind the oglio several good officers approved of this retreat which in their opinion was a very prudent one to which we may further add that the failure of the provisions and ammunition promised by the ministry rendered it absolutely necessary the courtiers and especially those who had hopes of succeeding catinat in the command represented his behavior as a scandal to the french name marshal villeroi persuaded them that he could retrieve the honor of the nation the confidence with which he spoke and the liking the king had for him procured him the command in italy and marshal catinat notwithstanding his former victories at staffarde and marseilles was obliged to serve under him the marshal duke de villeroi was son of the kings governor had been brought up with his royal master and always enjoyed a principal share of his favor he had been with him in all his campaigns and made one in all his parties of pleasure he was of an agreeable and engaging figure extremely brave a very worthy man a good friend sincere in his connections and magnificent in all his actions but his enemies said he was more taken up after he   came to be general with the honor and pleasure of commanding than with the schemes of a great captain and reproached him with being so much wedded to his own opinion as to slight the advice of everyone else he now repaired to italy to lord it over catinat and disgust the duke of savoy his behavior showed that he thought a favorite of louis xiv at the head of so powerful an army was infinitely superior to a prince he never called the duke by any other name than m de savoy and treated him like a common general in the pay of france and not like a sovereign in a word the friendship of this prince was not regarded so much as was necessary considering that he was master of the barriers which nature had placed between france and italy the court thought that fear was the surest knot to bind him and that a french army surrounding about six or seven thousand piedmontese was a sufficient pledge for his fidelity marshal villeroi behaved to him as his equal in common correspondence and his superior in the command the duke of savoy had the empty title of generalissimo but marshal villeroi was so in fact he immediately gave orders for attacking prince eugene in the post of chiari near the oglio the general officers were of opinion that it was against all the rules of war to attack this post for these essential reasons that it was of no consequence that the intrenchments were inaccessible that nothing could be gained by forcing  0 them and that if they failed the reputation of the whole campaign would be lost villeroi however told the duke of savoy that he must march and sent an aidedecamp to order marshal catinat in his name to begin the attack catinat made the messenger repeat the order to him three different times then turning toward the officers who were under his command come on then gentlemen we must obey they marched directly up to the intrenchments and the duke of savoy fought like a person who had no subject of complaint against france catinat fought everywhere for death he was wounded but nevertheless on seeing the kings troops repulsed he made a retreat after which he quitted the army and returned to versailles to give an account of his conduct to the king without complaining of any one prince eugene always maintained his superiority over marshal villeroi at length in the heart of the winter of   0  one day when the marshal was sleeping in full security in cremona a strong town and provided with a very numerous garrison he found himself awakened with the noise of a discharge of small arms upon which he rose in haste mounted his horse and the first thing he met with was a squadron of the enemy the marshal was immediately made prisoner and led out of the town without knowing anything that had passed there and unable to conceive the cause of so extraordinary an event prince eugene was already in the town of    cremona a priest called bozzoli provost at st mary la nova had introduced the german troops through a common sewer four hundred men having been conveyed through this sewer into the priests house immediately killed the guard at the two gates which were opened and prince eugene entered the city with four thousand men all this was done before the governor who was a spaniard had the least suspicion or marshal villeroi was awake the whole affair was conducted with the greatest secrecy order and diligence the spanish governor on the first alarm appeared in the street with a few soldiers but was presently shot dead all the general officers were either killed or made prisoners excepting lieutenantgeneral count de revel and the marquis du prâlin chance however confounded the prudent measures of prince eugene it happened that the chevalier dentragues was that day to review the regiment of marines of which he was colonel the soldiers were assembled at four oclock in the morning in one of the outskirts of the city exactly at the time that prince eugene entered at the other part dentragues began to run through the streets with his soldiers he repulsed those of the enemy that came in his way and by this means gave the rest of the garrison time to repair thither the streets and squares were filled with officers and soldiers confusedly mingled together some with arms some without and others half naked without any    commander at their head the fight began in the utmost confusion and they intrenched themselves from street to street and from square to square two irish regiments that made part of the garrison checked the efforts of the imperialists never was greater prudence shown in the surprise of a town nor more valor in defending it the garrison consisted of about five thousand men prince eugene had as yet introduced only four thousand a large detachment of his army was to have joined them by the bridge over the po the measures were well concerted but another stroke of chance rendered them all fruitless this bridge which was guarded only by a hundred french soldiers was to have been seized upon by the german cuirassiers who were ordered to go and make themselves masters of it the instant prince eugene entered the town for this purpose as they came in by the south gate next to the common sewer they were to go out into the country of cremona at the northern part of the city through the po gate and then immediately make the best of their way to the bridge as they were going through the city the guide who conducted them was killed by a musketshot from a window the cuirassiers mistook one street for another and wandered out of their way during this interval the irish assembled at the po gate attacked and repulsed the cuirassiers and the marquis du prâlin seizing this lucky moment ordered the bridge to be broken    down the aid which the enemy expected could not cross and the town was saved prince eugene after having fought the whole day and constantly keeping possession of the gate by which he entered at length retired taking with him marshal villeroi and most of the general officers prisoners but disappointed in taking cremona which his activity and prudence together with the negligence of the generals had once made him master of and which chance and the valor of the french and irish troops had snatched from him again marshal villeroi who was extremely unhappy on this occasion was condemned by the courtiers at versailles with all the severity and acrimony that his share of the royal favor and the loftiness of his character which was taken by them for vanity could inspire the king who blamed but did not condemn him was not a little displeased to find his choice so highly censured and in the heat of his resentment suffered these words to escape him they take a pleasure in abusing him because he is my favorite a term that he never before in his life made use of in regard to anyone the duke of vendôme was immediately ordered to go and take the command in italy the duke of vendôme was grandson of henry iv and like him intrepid mild beneficent and humble a stranger to hatred envy and revenge he showed pride only among princes and behaved    with equality to everyone else he was the only general under whom the common men were not led to fight merely from principles of military duty and that mechanical instinct which obeys the orders of an officer they fought for the duke of vendôme and would have laid down their lives to extricate him out of a false step into which his fiery genius sometimes hurried him he was thought not to equal prince eugene in the coolness and depth of his designs and the art of subsisting his troops he was too apt to neglect little matters and suffered military discipline to languish in his army he gave too much time to sleep and the pleasures of the table this overindulgence put him more than once in danger of being carried off but in the day of battle he made amends for all these faults by a presence of mind and discernment which seemed to grow from danger these opportunities he was continually seeking being not so well qualified for a defensive war as prince eugene but fully equal to him in the offensive the same disorder and negligence that he introduced into the army were visible to a surprising degree in his household and even in his own person from his great aversion to show or ostentation he contracted a slovenliness almost unparalleled and disinterestedness the most noble of all virtues became in him a fault by making him lose more by carelessness than he would have expended in acts of bounty he has been often known to want even common necessaries his brother the grand prior    who commanded under him in italy had all his faults which he carried to a still greater excess and made amends for by the same valor it is surprising to see two generals never rising from bed till four oclock in the afternoon and two princes grandsons of henry iv neglecting their persons in a manner that the meanest soldier would have thought shameful what is still more surprising is that mixture of activity and indolence with which vendôme carried on so smart a war against eugene a war of artifice surprises marches crossing of rivers petty skirmishes often as fruitless as bloody and murderous battles in which both sides claimed the victory such as that of luzzara—aug      0 —for which te deum was sung both at paris and vienna vendôme always came off conqueror when he had not to deal with prince eugene in person but as soon as that general appeared at the head of his troops the french had no longer the advantage in the midst of these battles and the sieges of so many towns and cities private intelligence was brought to versailles that the duke of savoy grandnephew of louis xiv fatherinlaw of the duke of burgundy and philip v was going to quit the bourbon interest and was actually in treaty with the emperor everyone was astonished that he should at once leave two sonsinlaw and give up what appeared to be his true interest but the emperor had promised him all that his sonsinlaw had    refused him montferrat mantua alexandria valencia and the countries between the po and the tanaro with more money than he received from france the money was to be furnished by england for the emperor had hardly sufficient to pay his troops england the richest of all the allies contributed more than any of them toward the common cause whether the duke of savoy showed any regard for the laws of nature and nations is a question in morality which has very little to do with the conduct of sovereigns the event however proved in the end that he was not at all wanting to the laws of policy in the treaty he made but he was wanting in another very essential point of politics in leaving his troops at the mercy of the french while he was treating with the emperor the duke of vendôme ordered them to be disarmed they were indeed no more than five thousand men but this was no inconsiderable object to the duke of savoy no sooner had the house of bourbon lost this ally when she heard that portugal had likewise declared against her peter king of portugal acknowledged the archduke charles for king of spain the imperial council in the name of this archduke dismembered in favor of peter ii a monarchy in which he was not as yet master of a single town and by one of those treaties which are never executed ceded to him vigo bayonne alcantara badajoz a part of estremadura all the countries lying to the west of the river la plata in america in a word he made    a partition of what he had not to give in order to acquire what he might the king of portugal the prince of hessedarmstadt minister to the archduke and the admiral of castile his creature implored the assistance of the king of morocco they not only entered into a treaty with these barbarians supplying them with horses and corn but they likewise asked for a body of troops the emperor of morocco muley ismael the most warlike and politic tyrant at that time in the mahometan nation would not send his troops but on such terms as were dangerous to christendom and shameful to the king of portugal he demanded a son of that kings as a hostage together with a certain number of towns the treaty did not take place and the christians contented themselves with tearing each other to pieces with their own hands without calling in barbarians the assistance of africa would not have done the house of austria so much service as that of england and holland did churchill earl and afterward duke of marlborough was declared general of the confederate armies of england and holland in the year   0  this man proved as fatal to the french greatness as any that had appeared for many ages he was not one of those generals to whom a minister delivers the plan of the campaign in writing and who after having followed the order he has received from the cabinet at the head of his army returns home to solicit the honor of being employed again he    at that time governed the queen of england both by the occasion she had for his service and by the authority his wife had over her affections he had the command of the parliament by his powerful interest and by that of the treasurer godolphin whose son married one of his daughters thus having the direction of the court the parliament the war and the treasury more a king than ever william had been as great a politician and a much greater general he exceeded the most sanguine hopes of the allies he possessed in a degree superior to any general of his time that tranquil courage in the midst of tumult and serenity of soul in danger which the english call a cool head it is perhaps to this qualification the principal gift in nature for a commander that the english are indebted for their victories over the french in the fields of poitiers crécy and agincourt marlborough who was indefatigable as a warrior during the campaign was no less active a negotiator in the winter he went to the hague and visited all the courts of germany he persuaded the dutch to drain themselves to humble france he roused the resentment of the elector palatine he flattered the pride of the elector of brandenburg who wanted to be king by which he drew from him a supply of eight thousand men prince eugene on his side had no sooner finished one campaign than he went to vienna to make preparations for another we may easily judge whether an army is better supplied    where the general is at the same time the prime minister these two great men who had sometimes the command jointly sometimes separately always understood each other they had frequent conferences at the hague with the grand pensionary heinsius and the secretary fagel who governed the united provinces with equal abilities and better success than the barneveldts and dewitts they in concert continually set the springs of onehalf of europe in play against the house of bourbon and the french ministry was at that time much too weak to oppose those combined forces for any length of time the plan of operations for the campaign was always kept an inviolable secret they settled their designs among themselves and did not intrust them even to those who were to second them until the instant of execution chamillard on the contrary being neither a politician a warrior nor even acquainted with the management of the revenue and who yet acted as prime minister was unable to plan any designs of his own and was therefore obliged to be dependent on inferior people for their assistance his secret was almost always divulged even before he himself knew exactly what was to be done of this the marquis de feuquières accuses him with great justice and madame de maintenon acknowledges in her letters that she had made choice of a man who was not fit for the ministry this was one  0 of the principal causes of the misfortunes which befell france marlborough as soon as he came to the command of the allied army in flanders showed that he had learned the art of war of the great turenne under whom he had in his younger days made his first campaigns as a volunteer he was then known in the army only by the name of the handsome englishman but turenne soon perceived that this handsome englishman would one day be a great man he began his command by raising several subaltern officers in whom he had discovered merit and who were till then unknown without confining himself to the order of military rank which we in france call the order of the tableau he was sensible that when preferment is only the consequence of seniority all emulation must perish and that an officer is not always the most serviceable because the most ancient he presently formed men he gained ground upon the french without hazarding a battle ginkel earl of athlone the dutch general disputed the command with him the first month and before six weeks were at an end was obliged to yield to him in every respect the king of france sent his grandson the duke of burgundy against him a wise and upright prince born to make a people happy the marshal de bouflers a man of indefatigable courage commanded the army under the young prince but the duke of burgundy after having seen several places taken before his face and being    by the skilful marches of the english obliged to retreat returned to versailles before the campaign was half over leaving bouflers to be a witness to marlboroughs successes who took venlo ruremonde and liège and continued advancing without losing the superiority one instant when marlborough returned to london at the close of this campaign he received all the honors that could be bestowed in a monarchy and a republic he was created duke by the queen and what was still more flattering he received the thanks of the two houses of parliament who sent deputies to compliment him at his own house but now there arose a person who seemed likely to restore the drooping fortunes of france this was the marshal duke de villars then lieutenantgeneral and whom we have since seen at the age of eightytwo commanderinchief of the armies of france spain and sardinia this man was bold and confident and had himself been the architect of his own fortune by his unwearied perseverance in the discharge of his duty he sometimes offended louis xiv and what was still more dangerous his minister louvois by speaking to them with the boldness with which he served he was accused of not having a modesty becoming his courage but at length it was seen that he had a genius formed for war and to command frenchmen he had been greatly advanced within a few years after having been left a long time unnoticed    never was there a man whose preferment created more jealousy and with less reason he was marshal of france duke and peer and governor of provence but then he had saved the state and others who had ruined it or had no other claim but that of being courtiers had met with as great rewards he was even upbraided with the riches which he acquired by contributions in the enemys country a just and reasonable reward for his valor and conduct while those who had amassed fortunes of ten times the value by the most scandalous methods continued to enjoy them with the approbation of the public he did not begin to taste the sweets of the reputation he had acquired till he was nearly eighty and he must have outlived the whole court to have enjoyed it undisturbed it may not be amiss to acquaint the world with the reason of this injustice in mankind it was owing to the want of art in marshal villars he had not enough to make himself friends with integrity and understanding nor to set a proper value upon himself by speaking that of himself which he deserved that others should say of him one day as he was taking leave of the king he said to him before the whole court sire i am going to fight against your majestys enemies and leave you in the midst of mine he said to the courtiers of the duke of orleans regent of the kingdom who had all grown rich by that subversion of the state called system for my part i never got    anything but by the enemies of my country these speeches which were accompanied by the same courage as his actions were too humbling to those who were already sufficiently incensed at his good fortune at the beginning of the war he was one of the lieutenantgenerals who had the command of the detachments in alsace his army was at that time in the mountains of breisgau which border on the black forest and this immense forest separated the elector of bavarias army from the french catinat who commanded in strasburg had too much circumspection in his conduct to think of attacking the prince of baden at such a disadvantage as in case of a repulse the french army must be hopelessly lost and alsace laid open villars who had resolved to be marshal of france or to die in the attempt hazarded what catinat did not dare to undertake he wrote to court for permission and then marched toward the imperialists at friedlengen with an inferior army and fought the battle of that name oct      0  the horse engaged in the plain the foot climbed up to the top of the hill and attacked the german infantry which was intrenched in the woods i have more than once heard marshal villars himself say that after the battle was won and as he was marching at the head of his infantry a voice was heard crying out we are cut off upon which the whole body immediately took flight he directly ran up to    them crying out what is the matter friends we have gained the victory god bless the king the soldiers all pale and trembling repeated god bless the king and began to fly as before he declared that he never met with more difficulty than in rallying the conquerors and that if only two of the enemys regiments had showed themselves at that instant of general panic the french would have been beaten so frequently does the fate of battles depend on mere chance the prince of baden though he lost three thousand men with all his cannon was driven out of the field of battle and pursued for two leagues through woods and defiles while as a proof of his defeat the fort of friedlengen capitulated nevertheless he wrote to the court of vienna that he had gained the victory and ordered te deum to be sung which was more shameful to him than even the loss of the battle the french recovered from their panic proclaimed villars marshal of france on the field of battle and a fortnight later the king confirmed the title which the soldiers had conferred on him marshal villars having joined the elector of bavaria with his victorious army found him also a conqueror gaining ground of the enemy and in possession of the imperial city of ratisbon where the assembly of the empire had lately vowed his destruction villars was better qualified to serve his country    when acting only according to his own genius than in concert with another he carried or rather dragged the elector across the danube but no sooner had they passed that river than the elector began to repent of what he had done perceiving that on the least check he should be obliged to leave his dominions at the enemys mercy the count of styria at the head of nearly twenty thousand men was marching to join the grand army under the prince of baden near donauwörth the marshal told the elector that this must be prevented by marching directly and attacking styria the elector willing to temporize replied that he must consult his ministers and generals on that head am not i your minister and general answered villars do you want any other counsel but me when you are to give battle the prince realizing the danger which threatened his dominions still kept back and even grew angry with the general well then said villars if your electoral highness will not embrace this opportunity with your bavarians i will begin the battle with the french and immediately gave orders for the attack the prince was incensed and regarded villars as a madman but was obliged to fight against his will this was in the plains of höchstädt near donauwörth after the first charge there appeared another instance of the effect of chance in battles both armies were seized at the same time with a panic and fled and marshal villars saw himself left    alone for some minutes on the field of battle however he rallied his troops led them back to the charge and gained the victory three thousand of the imperialists were left dead on the field and four thousand taken prisoners with their cannon and baggage the elector made himself master of augsburg the road to vienna was open and it was even debated in the emperors council whether he should quit his capital the emperor was excusable for his apprehensions he was beaten everywhere the duke of burgundy with marshals tallard and vauban under him had just taken old breisach and tallard had not only taken landau but had also defeated the prince of hesse afterward king of sweden near spires as he was attempting to relieve the town if we believe the marquis de feuquières—a most excellent officer and competent judge in the military art though rather too severe in his decisions—marshal tallard won the battle by a fault and a mistake however he wrote thus to the king from the field of battle sire your majestys army has taken more standards and colors than it has lost private men in this action there was more execution done by the bayonet than in any other during the war the french have a singular advantage in the use of this weapon on account of their natural impetuosity but it has become more menacing than fatal quick and close firing has prevailed in its stead the english and germans were accustomed to fire in    divisions with greater order and readiness than the french the prussians were the first who loaded with iron rammers the second king of prussia taught his troops such an exercise that they could fire six times in a minute with great ease three ranks discharging their fire at once and then advancing briskly decide the fate of the battle nowadays the fieldpieces produce a no less formidable effect the battalions who are staggered with the fire do not wait to be attacked with the bayonet and are completely defeated by the cavalry so that the bayonet frightens more than it slays and the sword is absolutely useless to the infantry strength of body skill and courage are no longer of any service to a combatant the battalions are great machines and those which are best formed naturally bear down all that stand in their way this was the very thing which gave prince eugene the victory over the turks in those famous battles of temiswar and belgrade while the latter would in all probability have had the advantage from their superiority of numbers had these battles been what we called mixed fights thus the art of destroying each other is not only entirely different from what it was before the invention of gunpowder but even from what it was a century ago as the french arms maintained their reputation with such success at first in germany it was presumed that marshal villars would carry it still further by an impetuosity which would disconcert the    german phlegm but the qualifications which made him a formidable chief rendered it impossible for him to act in concert with the elector of bavaria the king would not suffer his generals to show haughtiness to any but his enemies and the elector of bavaria unhappily wrote for another marshal of france villars then whose presence was so necessary in germany where he had gained two battles and might possibly have crushed the empire was recalled and sent into the cévennes to make peace with the rebellious peasants we shall speak of these fanatics in the chapter on religion louis xiv had at this time enemies that were more terrible successful and irreconcilable than the inhabitants of the cévennes chapter xviii loss of the battle of höchstädt or blenheim the duke of marlborough returned from the low countries in the beginning of   0  with the same conduct and the same success he had taken bonn the residence of the elector of cologne thence he marched and retook huy and limburg and made himself master of all the lower rhine marshal villeroi now returned from his confinement commanded in flanders where he had no better success against marlborough than he had had against prince eugene marshal bouflers with a detachment of    his army had indeed gained a small advantage in the fight of eckeren over the dutch general opdam but an advantage which has no consequences is no advantage at all and now the house of austria was undone unless the english general marched to the assistance of the emperor the elector of bavaria was master of passau thirty thousand french under the command of marshal marsin who had succeeded villars overspread the countries of the other side of the danube there were several flying parties in austria vienna itself was threatened on one side by the french and bavarians and on the other by prince ragotski at the head of the hungarians fighting for their liberty and supplied with money by the french and the turks in this situation of affairs prince eugene hastens from italy to take command of the armies in germany he had an interview with the duke of marlborough at heilbronn the english general whose hands were at full liberty being left to act as he pleased by his queen and her allies the dutch marched with reinforcements into the heart of the empire taking with him ten thousand english foot and twentythree squadrons of horse he made forced marches and arrived on the banks of the danube near donauwörth opposite the elector of bavarias lines where about eight thousand french and as many bavarians lay intrenched to guard the country they had conquered after an engagement of two hours marlborough  0 forced the lines at the head of three battalions of english and routed the bavarians and french it is said that he killed six thousand of the enemy and lost as many himself a general concerns himself little about the number of slain provided he succeeds in his enterprise he then took donauwörth july     0  repassed the danube and laid bavaria under contribution marshal villeroi who attempted to follow him in his first marches lost sight of him and knew not where he was till he heard the news of his victory at donauwörth marshal tallard who with a corps of thirty thousand men had marched by another route to oppose marlborough came and joined the elector at the same time prince eugene arrived and joined marlborough at length the two armies met within a small distance of donauwörth and nearly in the same place where marshal villars had gained a victory the year before i know that the marshal who was then in the cévennes having received a letter from tallards army written the night before the battle acquainting him with the disposition of the two armies and the manner in which marshal tallard intended to engage wrote to his brotherinlaw the president de maisons telling him that if marshal tallard gave the enemy battle in that position he must inevitably be beaten this letter was shown to louis xiv and afterward became public    the french army including the bavarians consisted of eightytwo battalions and one hundred and sixty squadrons which made in all nearly sixty thousand men the corps being then not quite complete the enemy had sixtyfour battalions and one hundred and fiftytwo squadrons in all not more than fiftytwo thousand men for armies are always made more numerous than they really are this battle which proved so bloody and decisive deserves particular attention the french generals were accused of a number of errors the chief was having brought themselves under a necessity of accepting a battle instead of letting the enemys army waste itself for want of forage and giving time to marshal villeroi either to fall upon the netherlands then in a defenceless state or to penetrate farther into germany but it should be considered in reply to this accusation that the french army being somewhat stronger than that of the allies might hope for the victory which indeed would have dethroned the emperor the marquis de feuquières reckons up no less than twelve capital faults committed by the elector marsin and tallard before and after the battle one of the greatest was not having placed a large body of foot in their centre and having separated the two bodies of the army i have often heard marshal villars say that this disposition was unpardonable marshal tallard was at the head of the right wing and the elector with marsin at the left tallard    had all the impetuous and sprightly courage of a frenchman an active and penetrating understanding and a genius fruitful in expedients and resources it was he who had made the partition treaties he was allied to glory and fortune by all the ways of a man of genius and courage the battle of spires had gained him great honor notwithstanding the animadversions of feuquières for a victorious general never appears culpable in the eyes of the public while he who is beaten is always in the wrong however just or prudent his conduct may have been but marshal tallard labored under a malady very dangerous to a general his sight was so weak that he could not distinguish objects at the distance of twenty paces from him those who were well acquainted with him have told me moreover that his impetuous courage quite the reverse of the duke of marlboroughs growing still warmer in the heat of the action deprived him sometimes of the necessary presence of mind this defect was owing to a dry and inflammatory state of the blood it is well known that the qualifications of the mind are chiefly influenced by the constitution of the body this was the first time that marshal marsin had the chief command with a great deal of wit and a good understanding he is said to have had rather the experience of a good officer than of a general as to the elector of bavaria he was looked upon not less as a great general than as a valiant and    amiable prince the darling of his subjects and who had more magnanimity than application at length the battle began between twelve and one oclock in the afternoon marlborough with his english having passed a small rivulet began the attack upon tallards cavalry that general a little before had ridden toward the left wing to observe its disposition it was no small disadvantage to tallards corps from the beginning to be obliged to fight without its general at its head the corps commanded by the elector and marsin had not yet been attacked by prince eugene marlborough began upon our right nearly an hour before eugene could have come up to the elector at our left as soon as marshal tallard heard that marlborough had attacked his wing he immediately posted thither where he found a furious action begun the french cavalry rallied three times and was as often repulsed he then went to the village of blenheim where he had posted twentyseven battalions and twelve squadrons this was a little detached army that kept a continual fire on marlborough during the whole time he was engaged with tallards wing after giving his orders in this village he hastened back to the place where the duke with a body of horse and battalions of foot between the squadrons was driving the french cavalry before him m de feuquières is certainly mistaken in saying that marshal tallard was not present at this time    but was taken prisoner as he was returning from marsins wing to his own all accounts agree and it was but too true of him that he was actually present he received a wound in the action and his son was mortally wounded by his side his cavalry was routed before his face the victorious marlborough forced his way between the two bodies of the french army on one side while on the other his general officers got between the village of blenheim and tallards division which was also separated from the little army in that village in this cruel situation marshal tallard flew to rally some of the broken squadrons but the badness of his sight made him mistake a squadron of the enemy for one of his own and he was taken prisoner by the hessian troops that were in english pay at the very instant that the general was taken prince eugene after having been three times repulsed at length gained the advantage the rout now became total in tallards division everyone fled with the utmost precipitation and so great was the terror and confusion throughout that whole wing that officers and soldiers ran headlong into the danube without knowing whither they were going there was no general officer to give orders for a retreat no one thought of saving those twentyseven battalions and twelve squadrons of the best troops of france that were so unfortunately shut up in blenheim or of bringing them into action at last marshal marsin ordered a retreat the count du bourg    afterward marshal of france saved a small part of the infantry by retreating over the marshes of höchstädt but neither he marsin nor anyone else thought of this little army which still remained in blenheim waiting for orders which were never sent them it consisted of eleven thousand effective men from the oldest corps there are many examples of less armies that have beaten others of fifty thousand men or at least made a glorious retreat but the nature of the post determines everything it was impossible for them to get out of the narrow streets of a village and range themselves in order of battle in the face of a victorious army that would have overwhelmed them at once with a superior front and even with their own artillery which had all fallen into the victors hands the general officer who commanded here was the marquis of clérembaut son of the marshal of that name he was hastening to find marshal tallard to receive orders from him when he was told that he was taken prisoner and seeing nothing but people running on all sides he fled with them and in flying was drowned in the danube brigadier sivières who was posted in this village ventured on a bold stroke he called aloud to the officers of the regiments of artois and provence to follow him several officers even of other regiments obeyed the summons and rushing out of the village like those who make a sally from a town that is besieged fell upon the enemy but after this sally    they were obliged to return again one of these officers named des nonvilles returned some few moments afterward on horseback with the earl of orkney as soon as he entered the village the rest of the officers flocked round him inquiring if it was an english prisoner that he had brought in no gentlemen replied he i am a prisoner myself and am come to tell you that you have nothing left but to surrender yourselves prisoners of war here is the earl of orkney who has come to offer you terms at hearing this all these old bands shuddered with horror the regiment of navarre tore its colors and buried them but at length they were obliged to yield to necessity and this whole army laid down its arms without having struck a blow my lord orkney has told me that it was impossible for them to do otherwise in their confined situation europe was struck with astonishment that the best troops in france should have suffered such disgrace their misfortune was at first imputed to cowardice but a few years afterward the same thing happening to fourteen thousand swedes who surrendered at discretion to the muscovites in the open field fully justified the french such was this famous action of aug      0  which in france was known by the name of the battle of höchstädt and by the english and germans was called the battle of blenheim the victors had nearly five thousand killed and eight thousand wounded the greatest part of which loss fell on the    side of prince eugene the french army was almost entirely cut to pieces of sixty thousand men who had been so long victorious not more than twenty thousand could be gathered together after the battle this fatal day was distinguished by the loss of twenty thousand men killed fourteen thousand made prisoners all the cannon a prodigious number of standards colors tents and equipages with the general of the army and twelve hundred officers of note in the hands of the conquerors the runaways dispersed themselves on all sides and more than a hundred leagues of country were lost in less than a month the whole electorate of bavaria now fallen under the yoke of the emperor experienced all the severity of austrian resentment and all the cruelties of a rapacious soldiery the elector on his way to brussels whither he was flying for refuge met with his brother the elector of cologne who like him was driven out of his dominions they embraced each other with a flood of tears the court of versailles accustomed to continual successes was struck with astonishment and confusion at this reverse the news of the defeat arrived in the midst of the rejoicings made on account of the birth of a greatgrandson of louis xiv no one would venture to acquaint the king with this cruel truth at length madame de maintenon took upon her to let him know that he was no longer invincible it has been affirmed both by word of    mouth and in writing and the same has been repeated in above twenty different histories that the emperor ordered a monument of this defeat to be erected on the plains of blenheim with an inscription greatly to the dishonor of the french king but no such monument ever existed the english erected one to the honor of their duke of marlborough the queen and the parliament built an immense palace for him on one of his principal estates to which they gave the name of blenheim where this battle is represented in most curious paintings and tapestry the thanks of the two houses of parliament and of the cities and boroughs and the general acclamation of the people were the first fruits he received from his victory but the poem written by the famous addison a monument more durable than the palace of blenheim is reckoned by this warlike and learned nation among the most honorable rewards bestowed on the duke of marlborough the emperor created him a prince of the empire bestowed on him the principality of mindelsheim which was afterward exchanged for another but he was never known by that title the name of marlborough being now the most noble he could bear by the dispersion of the french army an open passage was left to the allies from the danube to the rhine they passed the latter and entered alsace prince louis of baden a general famous for his encampments and marches invested landau joseph    king of the romans eldest son of the emperor leopold came to be present at this siege landau was taken and afterward traerbach notwithstanding the loss of a hundred leagues of country the french extended their frontiers louis xiv supported his grandson in spain and his arms were victorious in italy it required great efforts to make head against the victorious marlborough in germany which however he did the scattered remains of the army were gathered together the garrisons were ordered to furnish men and the militia were ordered to take the field the ministry borrowed money everywhere at length an army was got together and marshal villars was recalled from the heart of the cévennes to take the command he came and joined the army at trier where he found himself in presence of the english general with an inferior army both sides were desirous of giving battle but the prince of baden not coming up soon enough to join his troops to those of the english villars had the honor of obliging marlborough to decamp in may   0  this was doing a great deal at that time the duke of marlborough who had a sufficient esteem for marshal villars to wish to be esteemed by him again wrote him the following billet while he was decamping do me the justice sir to believe that my retreat is entirely the prince of badens fault and that i esteem you even more than i am angry with him  0 the french had still some barriers in germany the enemy had not yet done anything in flanders where marshal villeroi now at liberty had the command in spain king philip v and the archduke charles were both in expectation of the crown the former from the powerful assistance of his grandfather and the good will of the greater part of the spaniards the latter from the assistance of the english and the partisans he had in catalonia and aragon this archduke afterward emperor second son of the emperor leopold went toward the latter part of   0  without any retinue to london to implore the assistance of queen anne now the english power appeared in all its glory this nation which had in fact so little to do with this quarrel furnished the austrian prince with two hundred transport ships thirty ships of war joined to ten sail of the dutch nine thousand men and a sum of money to go and conquer a kingdom for himself but notwithstanding the superiority which power and benefits confer the emperor in his letter to queen anne which the archduke presented would not give this princess his benefactress the title of majesty but only that of serenity agreeable to the style of the court of vienna which custom alone could justify and which reason has since changed when pride has been obliged to stoop to necessity    chapter xix losses in spain—the battles of ramillies and turin and their consequences one of the first exploits performed by these english troops was the taking of gibraltar a place justly deemed impregnable a long chain of steep rocks forbade all approach to it by land it had no harbor but only a long bay very wild and unsafe where ships lay exposed to storms and to the artillery of the fortress and mole the inhabitants of the town were alone sufficient to defend it against a fleet of a thousand ships and a hundred thousand men but this very strength was the cause of its being taken there were only a hundred men in garrison but these were more than sufficient had they not neglected a duty which they looked upon as useless the prince of hesse had landed with eighteen hundred soldiers on the northernmost neck of land behind the town but the steepness of the rock made an attack upon the place impracticable on that side the fleet in vain fired more than fifteen thousand shot at length a body of sailors in one of their merrymakings happened to row close under the mole in their boats the cannon of which might have sunk them all but not a gun was fired upon this they mounted the mole made themselves masters of it and fresh troops flocking in on all sides this impregnable town was at length obliged to surrender on aug        0  it is still in possession of the english and spain now again become a formidable power under the administration of the princess of parma second wife of philip v and lately victorious in africa and italy beholds with an impotent grief gibraltar in the hands of a northern nation that had hardly a single ship in the mediterranean two centuries ago immediately after the taking of gibraltar the english fleet now mistress of the sea attacked the count de toulouse admiral of france in view of the castle of malaga this battle aug      0  though not a decisive one was the last epoch of the maritime power of louis xiv his natural son the count de toulouse admiral of the kingdom had fifty ships of the line and twentyfour galleys under his command he made a glorious retreat with very little loss but the king afterward sent thirteen ships to attack gibraltar while marshal de tessé laid siege to it by land this double rashness proved the ruin of both army and fleet some of the ships were destroyed by a storm others were boarded and taken by the english after a most noble resistance and another part of them burned on the coast of spain from that day the french had no longer any large fleets either in the western ocean or the mediterranean the marine returned nearly to the state from which louis xiv had raised it as well as many other glorious things which rose and set under his reign the english who had taken gibraltar for themselves    in less than six weeks conquered the kingdom of valencia and catalonia for the archduke charles they took barcelona by an event of chance which was owing to the rashness of the besiegers the english were at that time commanded by one of the most extraordinary men ever produced by that country so fruitful in proud valiant and whimsical minds this was the earl of peterborough a man who in every respect resembled those heroes with whose exploits the imagination of the spaniards has filled so many books at fifteen years of age he left london to go and make war against the moors in africa at twenty he was the first who set on foot the revolution in england and went over to the prince of orange but lest the true reason of his voyage should be suspected he took passage for america and then went over to the hague in a dutch vessel he parted with all his fortune more than once he was now carrying on the war in spain almost at his own expense and maintained the archduke and all his household it was this extraordinary man who with the prince of hessedarmstadt was laying siege to barcelona he proposed to the prince to make a sudden attack on the intrenchments which covered fort montjoie and the town these intrenchments were carried sword in hand the prince of darmstadt fell in the attack a bomb falling upon a magazine of powder in the fort blew it up the fort was taken and the town thereupon capitulated the viceroy came to one    of the gates of the town to confer with lord peterborough but the articles were not yet signed when their ears were suddenly struck with loud cries and shrieks you have betrayed us my lord said the viceroy to peterborough we made a fair capitulation and there your english have entered the city over the ramparts and are killing robbing and plundering everyone you are mistaken replied lord peterborough it must certainly be the prince of darmstadts troops there is no other way left to save your town but to let me enter immediately with my english i will make everything quiet and return again to the gate to sign the capitulation he spoke this with an air of truth and grandeur that added to the present danger entirely persuaded the governor who immediately let him enter he flew through the streets with his officers where he presently found the germans and catalans busy in plundering the houses of the principal citizens he drove them off and made them quit their booty after this he met with the duchess of popoli in the hands of some soldiers who were going to dishonor her he took her from them and delivered her to her husband at length having made everything quiet he returned to the gate according to his promise and signed the capitulation the spaniards were confounded to find such magnanimity in the english whom the populace had always been taught to look upon as merciless barbarians because they were heretics    to the loss of barcelona succeeded the mortification of a fruitless attempt to retake it philip v though he had the greater part of spain in his interest had neither generals engineers nor hardly soldiers the count of toulouse returned to block up the harbor with twentyfive ships of war the whole remains of the french navy marshal de tessé formed the siege by land with thirtyone squadrons of horse and thirtyseven battalions of foot but the english fleet appearing that of france was obliged to retire and de tessé raised the siege with precipitation may     0  leaving an immense quantity of provisions behind him in his camp and one thousand five hundred wounded to the mercy of lord peterborough these were heavy losses and it was hard to say whether it had cost france more to conquer spain than it did now to assist it nevertheless the grandson of louis xiv still kept his ground through the affection of the castilians whose greatest pride is their fidelity and who on this occasion continued firm to the choice they had made in italy affairs wore a better aspect louis was avenged on the duke of savoy the duke of vendôme had in the beginning repulsed prince eugene with some glory in the battle of cassano near the adda this proved a bloody day and one of those drawn battles for which both sides sing te deum and that serve only to destroy men without advancing the affairs of either party after the battle of cassano he gained a complete victory at cassinato    on april      0  in the absence of prince eugene and that prince arriving next day saw another detachment of his army entirely routed in short the allies were obliged to give ground everywhere before the duke of vendôme turin alone remained to be taken they were already on the march to invest it and there appeared no possibility of relieving it marshal villars pushed the prince of baden in germany villeroi with an army of eighty thousand men in germany hoped to indemnify himself on marlborough for the ill success he had met with against prince eugene his too great confidence in his own abilities proved now more fatal than ever to france marshal villerois army was encamped near the river mehaigne by the head of the little ghette his centre was at ramillies a village since as famous as that of blenheim it was in his power to have avoided a battle he was advised to do so by his general officers but a blind passion for glory prevailed over every other consideration it is said that the disposition he made for the battle was such that everyone of the least experience foresaw the fatal consequence his centre was composed of newly raised troops neither complete nor acquainted with military discipline he left the baggage between the lines and posted his left wing behind a morass as if he intended to prevent it from coming near the enemy on may      0  marlborough who observed all    these mistakes with a careful eye drew up his army in such a manner as to take advantage of them he perceived that the left wing of the french army could not come up to attack his right he therefore made drafts from that part of his army in order to fall on the enemys centre at ramillies with a superior force monsieur de gassion the lieutenantgeneral observing these movements cried out to the marshal you are undone sir if you do not instantly change the order of battle make a draft from your left wing that you may have an equal force to oppose the enemy close your lines more if you lose a minute you are irrecoverably lost this salutary advice was backed by several of the other officers but the marshal would not believe them when marlborough began the attack he found the army drawn up in the very manner in which he himself would have posted it for a defeat this was publicly declared through all france and history is partly a relation of the opinions of men but may it not be alleged that the troops of the confederates were better disciplined and that the confidence they had in their generals and their past successes inspired them with superior boldness were there not some of the french regiments who did not do their duty and do we not know that those battalions who can best stand fire decide the destiny of states the french army did not maintain its ground for half an hour at höchstädt the fight lasted for eight hours and the french killed    over eight thousand men but at the battle of ramillies they killed only two thousand five hundred the defeat was general the french lost twenty thousand men together with the honor of their nation and every hope of recovering the advantage bavaria and cologne had been lost by the battle of blenheim and all spanish flanders was now lost by this of ramillies marlborough entered victorious into antwerp and brussels took ostend and menin surrendered to him marshal villeroi in despair did not dare to acquaint the king with this defeat he waited five days before despatching a courier at length he wrote a confirmation of this news which had already filled the court of france with consternation and when he returned to versailles to present himself to the king that monarch instead of reproaching him only said monsieur le maréchal people at our time of life are not fortunate the king immediately sent to italy for the duke of vendôme where he thought his presence not necessary in order to replace villeroi in flanders and repair if possible his disgrace he still entertained hopes and with just reason that the taking of turin would make him amends for all these losses prince eugene was at too great a distance to come to its relief he was on the other side the adige and a long chain of intrenchments that lined the river on this side seemed to make a passage impracticable    fortysix squadrons and a hundred battalions formed the defence of this great city the duke de la feuillade who commanded this army was the gayest and most amiable man in the kingdom and though soninlaw of the minister he was the darling of the people he was a son of that marshal de la feuillade who erected the statue of louis xiv in the square des victoires he appeared to have as much courage as his father the same ambition the same magnificence and more understanding he expected the staff of marshal of france as a reward for his taking turin chamillard his fatherinlaw who loved him tenderly had left nothing undone to secure him success the imagination stands appalled at the detail of the preparations made for this siege those readers who have it not in their power to inform themselves of these matters may perhaps not be displeased to meet here with an account of this immense and fruitless undertaking there were a hundred and forty pieces of cannon and it is to be observed that each large cannon mounted on its carriage costs about two thousand crowns one hundred and ten thousand balls one hundred and six thousand cartridges of one form and three hundred thousand of another twentyone thousand bombshells twentyseven thousand seven hundred hand grenades fifteen thousand sandbags thirty thousand pioneering tools and twelve hundred thousand pounds of powder besides lead iron tin  0 cordage with everything proper for the miners sulphur saltpetre and implements of all kinds it is certain that the expense of all these preparations for destruction was more than sufficient to have founded a numerous colony and put it into a flourishing condition every siege of a great town requires the same prodigious expense and yet when a little village is to be repaired at home it is neglected the duke de la feuillade full of ardor and activity inferior to no one in undertakings where courage alone was required but incapable of conducting those that called for art reflection and time hurried the siege against all rules marshal vauban the only general perhaps who loved his country better than himself had proposed to the duke de la feuillade to come and direct the siege as an engineer and to serve in his army as a volunteer but the pride of la feuillade made him take this offer for insolence concealed beneath the appearance of modesty and was piqued that the best engineer in france should presume to give him advice he wrote back to him in a letter which i have seen i hope to take turin by cohorn this cohorn was the vauban of the allies an excellent engineer and a good general who had taken several places that had been fortified by vauban after such a letter it was necessary to take turin but having begun the attack by the citadel which was the strongest part and the city not being completely surrounded an opening was left for men or provisions to be thrown in or    for the duke of savoy to sally out in short the greater impetuosity the duke de la feuillade showed in his repeated and fruitless attacks the more tedious was the siege the duke of savoy came out of the town with some squadrons of horse in order to amuse the duke de la feuillade the latter immediately quitted the direction of the siege to run after the prince who being better acquainted with the ground baffled his pursuit thus la feuillade missed the duke and the business of the siege suffered by it all our historians almost to a man assert that the duke de la feuillade had no intention of taking turin and pretend that he had sworn to the duchess of burgundy to respect her fathers capital they likewise tell us that this princess prevailed upon madame de maintenon to cause such measures to be taken as would save the town it is certain that almost all the officers in this army were for a long time persuaded of the truth of this but it was only one of those popular rumors which are the disgrace of the novelist and the dishonor of the historian besides how contradictory it was that the general who would not take turin should endeavor to seize on the person of the duke of savoy from may    till june  0 the duke of vendôme had been posted on the banks of the adige to cover this siege and thought himself competent with seventy battalions and sixty squadrons to stop all the passages against prince eugene    the imperial general was in want of men and money the mercers company of london loaned him about six millions of our livres he then sent for a supply of men from the circles of the empire the slowness of these reinforcements might have proved the ruin of italy but the slowness of the siege of turin was still greater vendôme was already appointed to go and repair the losses in flanders but before he left italy he suffered prince eugene to cross the adige to pass the white canal and even the po itself a river larger and in some places more difficult of passage than the rhine and before he himself left the banks of the po he saw prince eugene in a condition to advance even to turin thus he left affairs in the most critical state in italy while in flanders germany and spain they appeared desperate the duke of vendôme then went to mons to assemble villerois scattered forces and the duke of orleans nephew of louis xiv was sent to command his army on the banks of the po he found these troops in as much disorder as if they had suffered a defeat eugene had passed the po in sight of vendôme he now crossed the tanaro in view of the duke of orleans took sarpi correggio and reggio stole a march on the french and at length joined the duke of savoy near asti all that the duke of orleans could do was to march and join la feuillade in his camp before turin prince eugene followed with the utmost diligence the    duke of orleans had now two alternatives either to wait for prince eugene in the investing lines or to march and meet him while he was yet on the other side of veillane he called a council of war at which were present marshal marsin who had lost the battle of blenheim the duke de la feuillade albergoti st fremont and other lieutenantgenerals to whom he thus addressed himself gentlemen if we remain in our lines we lose the battle the lines of circumvallation are above five leagues in length it will be impossible for us to line all these intrenchments on one hand here is the regiment of marines that is not above two men deep and on the other hand there are many places left entirely naked the doire which runs through our camp will prevent our men from marching readily to the assistance of one another besides when the french know they are attacked they lose one of their principal advantages that impetuosity and instantaneous ardor which so frequently decide the fate of battles believe me it is to our interest to march directly to the enemy the lieutenantgenerals immediately cried out one and all let us march then marshal marsin drew the kings order out of his pocket which left everything to his decision in case of an action and it was his choice to remain in the lines the duke of orleans was not a little incensed to find that he was sent to the army only as a prince of the blood and not as a general however he was    obliged to follow marsins advice and made the necessary preparations for this disadvantageous action the enemy seemed at first to intend to make several attacks at once and the variety of their movements threw the french camp into confusion the duke of orleans proposed one thing marsin and la feuillade another they disputed and concluded upon nothing till at length they suffered the enemy to pass the doire and advance in eight columns each twentyfive men deep there was an immediate necessity of opposing them with battalions of equal thickness albergoti who was posted at a distance from the main army on the capucins hill had twenty thousand men with him and only a body of the enemys militia to oppose who did not dare to attack they sent from the camp for a detachment of twelve thousand men but he said that he could not weaken his division and gave some specious reasons time was lost in these altercations prince eugene attacked the intrenchments and in two hours forced them on sept     0  the duke of orleans was wounded and had retired to have his wound dressed but he had scarcely gotten to the surgeons tent when word was brought him that all was lost that the enemy was master of the camp and that the defeat was general nothing remained but immediate flight the trenches were abandoned and the whole army dispersed all the baggage provisions    and ammunition together with the military chest fell into the hands of the conquerors marshal marsin himself was wounded in the thigh and made prisoner one of the duke of savoys surgeons cut off his thigh and he died a few minutes after the operation sir paul methuen ambassador from england to the court of turin the most generous and brave man that his country had ever employed in her embassies fought by the duke of savoys side during the whole action he was present when marshal marsin was taken prisoner and was near him in his last moments and he told me that the marshal when he was dying spoke to him in these very terms be persuaded sir that it was contrary to my judgment that we waited for you in our lines these words seem positively to contradict what passed at the council of war and may nevertheless be true for marsin when he took leave of the king at versailles represented to his majesty that it would be proper to march and attack the enemy in case they should appear to relieve turin but chamillard intimidated by so many former defeats had afterward decided that the army should wait in the lines and not offer battle and this order given at versailles occasioned the defeat of sixty thousand men the french had not more than two thousand men killed in this engagement but we have already seen that a panic does more than even slaughter the impossibility of finding subsistence which would make an army retire after a victory brought back    the troops to dauphiny after their defeat everything was in such disorder that the count of medavygrancei who was at that time in mantua with a body of troops and beat the imperialists at castiglione on sept     0  under the command of the prince of hesse afterward king of sweden gained only a fruitless victory though it was complete in a word the duchies of milan mantua piedmont and lastly the kingdom of naples were all lost within a very little time of one another chapter xx losses of the french and spaniards continued—louis xiv humbled his perseverance and resources—battle of malplaquet the battle of höchstadt or blenheim cost louis xiv a fine army and the whole country from the danube to the rhine and the elector of bavaria all his dominions all flanders was lost to the very gates of lille by the fatal day of ramillies and the defeat at turin drove the french out of italy which had always happened to them in every war since the time of charlemagne they had still some troops left in the duchy of milan and the little victorious army under the count of medavy they were also still in possession of some strong places they offered to give up all these to the emperor provided he would permit these troops which amounted to about fifteen thousand men to retire    unmolested the emperor accepted of the proposition and the duke of savoy gave his assent thus the emperor with a dash of his pen became peaceable possessor of italy the kingdom of naples and sicily was guaranteed to him and everything that had formerly been feudal was now treated as subject to a supreme power he imposed a tax of one hundred and fifty thousand pistoles on tuscany forty thousand on the duchy of mantua and parma modena lucca and genoa notwithstanding they were free states were included in these impositions the emperor who had all these advantages on his side was not that leopold the ancient rival of louis xiv who under a show of moderation had secretly cherished the most ambitious views it was the fiery sprightly and passionate joseph his eldest son who was not so good a soldier as his father if ever there was an emperor who seemed formed to enslave germany it was this joseph his dominions stretched beyond the alps he laid the pope under contribution and by his sole authority in   0  had the electors of bavaria and cologne put under the ban of the empire and then stripped them of their dominions he kept bavarias children in prison and took away from them even their name their father had nothing left but to retire to france and the low countries afterward in      philip v ceded to him all spanish flanders if he could have kept this province it would    have been a better settlement for him than even bavaria and have freed him from his subjection to the house of austria but he could get possession only of the cities of luxemburg namur and charleroi the rest being in the hands of the victors everything now seemed to threaten louis xiv who had so lately been the terror of all europe there was nothing to oppose the duke of savoys entering france england and scotland had lately become one kingdom by the union or rather scotland now a province of england increased the power of its ancient rival in   0  and   0  all the enemies of france seemed to have acquired new strength and that kingdom to be on the verge of ruin she was assailed on all sides both by sea and land of the formidable fleets which louis xiv had raised scarcely twentyfive ships were left remaining strasburg still continued to be the barrier town toward germany but by the loss of landau all alsace lay exposed provence was threatened with an invasion by sea and land and the losses already sustained in flanders made us tremble for what was left and yet notwithstanding all these disasters the body of the kingdom had not yet been attacked and unsuccessful as the war had been we only lost what we had before conquered louis xiv still opposed his enemies and though beaten almost everywhere he continued to resist protect and even attack on all sides but affairs were as unsuccessful in spain as in italy germany    and flanders it is said that the siege of barcelona was still worse conducted than that of turin the count of toulouse had hardly made his appearance with his fleet when he was obliged to sail back again barcelona was relieved the siege raised and the french after having lost half their army were forced for want of provisions to march back into navarre a little kingdom that they kept from the spaniards and of which our kings take the title by a custom that seems beneath their dignity to these disasters was added yet another which seemed to be the finishing stroke the portuguese together with a body of english under the command of lord galloway a frenchman formerly count de ruvigni lately created a peer of ireland took every place they came to and had advanced even into the province of estremadura while the duke of berwick an englishman who commanded the troops of france and spain in vain attempted to stop their progress philip v uncertain of his fate was in pampeluna while his competitor charles was increasing his party and augmenting his forces in catalonia he was master of aragon the province of valencia cartagena and part of the province of granada the english took gibraltar for themselves and gave him minorca ivica and alicant besides the road to madrid was open to him and lord galloway entered that city without any resistance and proclaimed the archduke charles king on june      0   0 a single detachment sent from the army proclaimed him in toledo in short philips affairs seemed so desperate that marshal vauban the first of engineers and the best of citizens a man continually engaged in schemes some useful others impracticable and all of them singular actually proposed to the french court to send philip over to america to reign there in this case all the spaniards in philips interest would have left their country to follow him spain would have been left a prey to civil factions the french would have had the whole trade of peru and mexico and france would have been aggrandized even by the misfortunes of louis xivs family this project was actually under consideration at versailles but the perseverance of the castilians and the oversights of the enemy preserved the crown upon philips head the people loved him as the king of their choice and his queen the duke of savoys daughter had gained their affections by the pains she took to please them by an intrepidity above her sex and an active perseverance under misfortunes she went in person from city to city animating the minds of her subjects rousing their zeal and receiving the donations which they brought in on all sides so that in three weeks time she remitted her husband more than two hundred thousand crowns not one of the grandees who had taken the oath of fidelity proved false when lord galloway proclaimed the archduke in madrid the people cried out long live    king philip and at toledo they mutinied and put to flight the officers who were going to proclaim charles the spaniards had till then made very few efforts in support of their king but when they saw him thus distressed they exerted themselves in a surprising manner and on this occasion showed an example of courage quite the reverse of that of other nations who generally set out in a vigorous manner but shrink back at last it is very difficult to impose a king upon a nation against its will the portuguese english and austrians that were in spain were miserably harassed wherever they came suffered much for want of provisions and were guilty of errors almost unavoidable in a strange country so that they were beaten piecemeal in short philip v three months after his leaving madrid like a fugitive entered it again in triumph and was received with as much joy and acclamation as his rival had met with coldness and aversion louis xiv redoubled his efforts when he saw the spaniards bestir themselves and while he was obliged to provide for the safety of the seacoasts of the western ocean and the mediterranean by stationing militia all along shore though he had one army in flanders another at strasburg a body of troops in navarre and one in roussillon he sent a fresh reinforcement to marshal berwick in castile it was with these troops seconded by the spaniards    that berwick gained the important battle of almanza—april      0 —in which he beat galloway neither philip nor the archduke was present at this action on which the famous earl of peterborough who was singular in everything observed it is excellent indeed to fight against one another for them the duke of orleans who was to have the command in spain and who was very desirous of being present did not arrive till the day after the battle however he made all possible advantage of the victory by taking several places and among others lérida the rock on which the great condé had split on the other hand marshal villars now replaced at the head of the armies in germany because the government could not do without him made amends for the fatal defeat at hochstädt he forced the enemys lines at stollhofen on the other side the rhine dispersed their whole body levied contributions for fifty leagues round and advanced as far as the danube this momentary success gave a better face to affairs on the frontiers of germany but in italy all was lost the kingdom of naples entirely defenceless and accustomed to a change of masters was under the yoke of the conquerors and the pope unable to refuse a passage to the german troops through his dominions saw without daring to murmur the emperor make him his vassal against his will it is a strong instance of the force of received opinions and the power of custom that    naples may always be seized upon without consulting the pope and yet the possessor is always obliged to do him homage for it while the grandson of louis xiv was thus deprived of naples the grandfather was on the point of losing provence and dauphiny the duke of savoy and prince eugene had already entered those provinces by the narrow pass of tenda and louis xiv had the mortification of seeing that very duke of savoy who a twelvemonth before had hardly anything left but his capital and prince eugene who had been brought up at his court on the point of stripping him of toulon and marseilles toulon was besieged and in danger of being taken the english fleet lay before the harbor and bombarded the town a little more diligence precaution and unanimity would have carried toulon marseilles then left defenceless could have made no resistance and france seemed likely to lose two provinces but what is probable seldom happens there was time to send relief a detachment had been made from marshal villars army as soon as these provinces were threatened and the advantages in germany were made to give way to the safety of a part of france that part of the country by which the enemy entered was dry barren and hilly provisions were scarce and a retreat difficult a sickness which made great havoc in the enemys army proved favorable to louis xiv the siege    of toulon was raised and soon afterward the enemy evacuated provence and dauphiny was out of danger so seldom does an invasion prove successful unless there is an intelligence with the people of the country charles v failed in the same design and of late days the queen of hungarys troops have been disappointed in their attempts against this country however this invasion which cost the allies so dear proved of no small importance to the french the country had been spoiled and our forces divided europe little expected that while the french nation thus exhausted thought itself happy in having escaped an invasion louis xiv was sufficiently great and fruitful in expedients to attempt an invasion in great britain in spite of the weak state of his maritime forces and the powerful fleets of the english that covered the seas this expedition was proposed by some of the scotch in the interest of james iii the success was doubtful but louis thought the very attempt sufficiently glorious and actually declared afterward that he was determined as much by this motive as his political interest to carry the war into great britain at that time when we could with difficulty support the burden of it in so many other places and to endeavor to replace the son of james ii on the throne of scotland at least while we could hardly support philip    v on that of spain was a noble idea and after all not quite destitute of probability those of the scotch who had not sold themselves to the court of london were grieved to see themselves reduced to a state of dependence on the english and privately with one accord called upon the offspring of their ancient kings who in his infancy had been driven from the throne of three kingdoms and whose very birth had been contested by his enemies they promised to join him with thirty thousand men if he would only land at edinburgh with some few men from france louis xiv who in his time of prosperity had made such efforts in behalf of the father now did the same for the son though his fortunes were in the decline eight ships of war and seventy transports were got ready at dunkirk and six thousand men put on board in march   0  the count de gacé afterward marshal matignon had the command of the troops and the chevalier de forbin janson one of the best sailors of his time had that of the fleet everything seemed favorable for their design there were but three thousand regular troops in scotland england was left defenceless its soldiers being all engaged in flanders under the duke of marlborough the difficulty was to get there for the english had a fleet of fifty ships of war cruising at sea this expedition was exactly like the late one in      in favor of the grandson of james ii it was discovered by the government    and impeded by several unlucky accidents insomuch that the english ministry had time to send for twelve battalions out of flanders several of the most suspected persons were seized in edinburgh at length the pretender having showed himself on the scottish coast and not seeing the signals which had been agreed upon nothing was left but to turn back again the chevalier forbin landed him safely at dunkirk and by his prudent retreat saved the french fleet but the expedition was entirely frustrated matignon was the only one who gained anything on this occasion having opened his orders after he came out to sea he there found a patent for marshal of france a reward for what he meant to do but could not perform there cannot be a more absurd notion than that of some historians who pretend that queen anne had a correspondence with her brother in this affair it is absolute folly to suppose that she would invite her competitor for the crown to come and dethrone her they have confounded the time and imagined that she favored him because she afterward looked upon him in private as her successor but what prince would choose to be driven from the throne by his successor while the french affairs were every day growing worse and worse the king thought that by sending the duke of burgundy his grandson to head the army in flanders the presence of the heir presumptive to the crown would excite the emulation    of the troops which began to droop this prince was of a resolute and intrepid disposition pious just and learned he was formed to command wise men he loved mankind and endeavored to make them happy though well versed in the art of war he considered that art rather as the scourge of human kind and an unhappy necessity than the source of real glory this philosophical prince was the person sent to oppose the duke of marlborough and they gave him the duke of vendôme for an assistant it now happened as it too frequently does the experienced officer was not sufficiently listened to and the princes counsel frequently carried it over the generals reasons hence arose two parties whereas in the enemys army there was but one that of the public good prince eugene was at that time on the rhine but when he and marlborough were together they had but one opinion the duke of burgundy had the superiority in numbers france which europe looked upon as exhausted had furnished him with an army of one hundred thousand men and the allies at that time had not quite eighty thousand he had moreover the advantage of sympathy on his side from a country which had been so long under the spanish dominion was tired out with dutch garrisons and where a great part of the inhabitants were inclined to favor philip v by his correspondence in ghent and ypres he became master of these two places but the schemes of the soldier soon rendered fruitless    those of the politician the disagreement in the council of war already began to distract their operations so that now they began to march toward the dender and two hours afterward turned back again toward the scheldt to go to oudenarde in this manner they lost time while the duke of marlborough and prince eugene were making the best of theirs and acted in concert with each other the french were routed near oudenarde on july      0  this was not a great battle but it proved a fatal retreat error was added to terror the regiments were suffered to wander at random without receiving any orders and more than four thousand men were made prisoners on the road by the enemys army only a few miles from the field of battle the army in despondency retreated without any order part under ghent part under tournay and part under ypres and quietly suffered prince eugene now returned from the rhine to lay siege to lille with an inferior army to sit down before so large and wellfortified a town as lille without being master of ghent obliged to send for provisions and ammunition as far as ostend and these to be brought over a narrow causeway at the hazard of being every moment surprised was what europe called a rash action but which the misunderstanding and irresolution that prevailed in the french army rendered very excusable and was justified in the end by the success the grand convoys which might have been    intercepted arrived safe the troops that escorted them and which should have been defeated by a superior number proved victorious the duke of burgundys army that might have attacked that of the enemy before it was complete remained inactive and lille was taken to the astonishment of all europe who thought the duke of burgundy in a condition to besiege marlborough and eugene rather than those generals to besiege lille marshal bouflers defended the place nearly four months the inhabitants became so familiar with the noise of cannon and all the horror that attended a siege that public diversions were carried on as in time of peace and though a bomb one day fell very near the theatre it did not interrupt the entertainment marshal bouflers had made such judicious dispositions that the inhabitants of this great city remained perfectly secure in his vigilance the defence he made gained him the esteem even of his enemies the hearts of the inhabitants and a reward from the king those dutch historians or rather writers who affect to blame him should remember that to contradict the public voice a person must have been a witness and an intelligent one or prove what he advances in the meantime the army that had looked on while lille was taken began to diminish by little and little and suffered ghent to be taken next and then bruges and all the posts one after another few campaigns have proved more fatal than this  0 the officers in the duke of vendômes interest laid all these faults to the duke of burgundys council who blamed them on the duke of vendôme all minds were soured with misfortune one of the duke of burgundys courtiers said one day to the duke of vendôme thus it is never to go to mass you see how misfortunes follow us do you think then replied the duke of vendôme that marlborough goes there oftener than we the emperor joseph was puffed up with the rapid successes of the allied army he saw himself absolute in the empire master of landau and the road to paris in a manner open by the taking of lille a party of dutch soldiers had the boldness to advance as far as versailles from courtrai and carried off the kings first equerry from under the castle windows thinking it was the dauphin the duke of burgundys father paris was filled with terror and the emperor entertained as strong hopes of settling his brother charles on the throne of spain as louis xiv had of keeping his grandson in possession of it this succession which the spaniards had wanted to render indivisible was already split into three parts the emperor had taken lombardy and the kingdom of naples to himself his brother charles was still in possession of catalonia and a part of aragon the emperor at that time obliged pope clement xi to acknowledge the archduke for king of spain this pope who was said to resemble st    peter because he owned denied repented and wept had after the example of his predecessor acknowledged philip v and was attached to the house of bourbon the emperor to punish him declared several fiefs which at that time were held from the popes subject to the empire particularly parma and placentia laid waste several lands belonging to the holy see and seized on the town of comacchio in former times a pope would have excommunicated any emperor who had attempted to dispute with him the most trifling privileges and that excommunication would have driven the emperor from his throne but the power of this see was now reduced within its proper bounds clement xi at the instigation of france had ventured to unsheathe the sword but he had no sooner taken up arms than he repented of it he perceived that the romans were incapable of wielding the sword under a sacerdotal government he therefore laid down his arms left comacchio in the emperors hands as a pledge of his future peaceable conduct and consented to write to the archduke with the style of our dearest son the catholic king in spain a fleet of english ships in the mediterranean and a german army in his dominions soon made him glad to write to our dearest son charles king of spain it was thought that this suffrage of the popes though of no service in the german empire might have some effect on the spanish populace who had been made to believe that the archduke was unworthy to reign    because he was protected by heretics who had taken gibraltar there yet remained to the spanish monarchy beyond the continent the two islands of sardinia and sicily an english fleet had taken sardinia and given it to the emperor for the english were not willing that the archduke should have anything more than spain at that time they made treaties of partition with their arms the conquests of sicily they reserved for another time choosing to employ their ships at sea in capturing spanish galleons rather than in conquering new territories for the emperor france was now as much humbled as rome and more in danger resources began to fail credit was at a stand and the people who had idolized their monarch in his prosperity began to murmur against him when unfortunate a set of men to whom the ministry had sold the nation for a little ready money to supply the immediate call grew fat on the public calamity and insulted the sufferings of the people by their luxurious manner of living the money they had advanced was spent and had it not been for the bold industry of certain traders particularly those of st malo who made a voyage to peru and brought home thirty millions half of which they lent to the government louis xiv would not have had money to pay his troops the war had ruined the kingdom and the merchants saved it this was the case in spain the galleons which had escaped being    taken by the english helped to support philip v but this resource which was only of a few months duration did not facilitate the raising of recruits chamillard who had been made treasurer and secretary of war resigned the latter post in favor of m voisin afterward chancellor who had formerly been an intendant on the frontiers the armies were as badly supplied as before nor did merit meet with more encouragement chamillard afterward resigned the management of the treasury but desmarets who succeeded him was not able to restore a ruined credit the severe winter of   0  completed the despair of the nation the olive trees which bring in a great deal of money in the south of france were all destroyed almost all the fruittrees were killed by the severe frost there were no hopes of a harvest and there was very little corn in the granaries and what could be bought at a very great distance from the seaport towns of the levant and the coast of barbary was liable to be taken by the enemies fleets to whom we had hardly any ships of war to oppose the scourge of this dreadful winter was general all over europe but the enemies had more resources especially the dutch who had been so long the factors for other nations had magazines sufficiently stored to supply the strongest armies the allies could bring into the field in a plentiful manner while the french troops diminished and disheartened seemed ready to perish for want    louis xiv who had already made some advances toward a peace determined under these fatal circumstances to send his chief minister the marquis torci colbert to the hague assisted by the president rouillé this was a humbling step they first met at antwerp with two burgomasters from amsterdam named buis and vanderhussen who talked like conquerors and returned to the ministers of the proudest of all princes all the arrogance with which they themselves had been treated in      the statesgeneral had chosen no stadtholder since the death of king william and the dutch magistrates who already began to call their families the patrician families were so many petty kings the four dutch commissaries who attended the army behaved with the utmost insolence to more than thirty german princes whom they maintained in their pay send holstein hither said they tell hesse to come and speak to us in this manner did a set of merchants express themselves who all plain in their garb and abstemious in their way of living took a pleasure in trampling upon german haughtiness in their pay and mortifying the pride of a king who had formerly been their conqueror they were not contented with showing the world by these external marks of superiority that power is the only real greatness but they insisted on having ten towns in flanders given them in sovereignty and among others lille which was already in their    hands and tournay which was not yet taken thus the dutch wanted to reap all the fruits of the war not only at the expense of france but also at that of the house of austria whose cause they had been fighting in the same manner as the republic of venice had formerly augmented its territories with those of its neighbors the republican spirit is in the main fully as ambitious as the monarchial this plainly appeared a few months afterward for when this shadow of a negotiation had vanished and the allied army had gained some fresh advantages the duke of marlborough at that time more absolute in england than his royal mistress having been gained over by the dutch concluded a treaty with the statesgeneral in   0  by which they were to keep possession of all the frontier towns which should be taken from the french were to have garrisons in twenty fortresses in flanders to be maintained at the expense of the country and to have upper guelders in perpetual sovereignty by this treaty they would have become actual sovereigns of the seventeen provinces of the netherlands and have had supreme rule in liège and cologne in this manner did they want to aggrandize themselves by the ruin even of their allies they were full of these lofty projects when the chief minister of france came to them to ask for peace we must not therefore be surprised at the disdainful reception he met with after these first steps of humiliation louiss    minister went to the hague where he received in his masters name the last degree of insult he there saw prince eugene the duke of marlborough and the pensionary heinsius who all three were for continuing the war—the prince because it at once gratified his glory and his revenge marlborough because he gained both reputation and immense riches of which he was equally fond the third who was guided by the other two looked upon himself as a spartan humbling the pride of a persian monarch they proposed instead of peace a truce and during that truce a full satisfaction for all their allies without taking any notice of the kings provided the king should assist in driving his grandson from the throne of spain within two months and that as a surety for his performance of the treaty he should begin by ceding to the statesgeneral forever ten towns in flanders restore strasburg and breisach and renounce the sovereignty of alsace louis little expected some years before when he refused a company of horse to prince eugene when churchill was only a colonel in the english army and the name of heinsius was hardly known that one day these three men should impose such terms upon him the marquis de torci took his leave without negotiating and returned to carry the king the orders of his enemies louis xiv now did what he had never before done toward his subjects he justified his conduct in a circular letter which he addressed to them in which after acquainting his people with the    added burdens he was obliged to lay upon them he endeavored to rouse their indignation honor and even pity the politicians said that torci went to the hague in that suppliant manner only to throw the whole blame upon the enemy to justify louis xiv in the eyes of europe and animate the french to a just resentment but the fact is that he went there purely to demand peace the president rouillé was left some few days at the hague to endeavor to get more favorable conditions but all the answer he received to his remonstrances was an order from the statesgeneral to leave holland in twentyfour hours louis xiv when he heard the rigorous terms imposed upon him said to rouillé well then since i must make war i would rather it should be against my enemies than my children he then made preparations to try his fortune once more in flanders the famine which had laid waste the countries round proved a resource for the war those who wanted bread enlisted for soldiers many lands lay untilled but we had an army marshal villars who had been sent the preceding year into savoy to command a few troops whose ardor was revived by his presence and who had met with some little successes was recalled into flanders as the person in whom his country placed all her hopes marlborough had already taken tournay and with prince eugene who had covered the siege marched to invest mons marshal villars advanced    to prevent them having with him marshal bouflers a senior officer but who had desired to serve under him bouflers had a true affection for his king and country he proved on this occasion—notwithstanding what has been said by a very sensible man—that there are virtues in a monarchical state especially under a good master there are doubtless as many as in a republic with less enthusiasm perhaps but with more of what is called honor as soon as the french advanced to oppose the investing of mons the allies on their side advanced to attack them near the wood of blangies and the village of malplaquet sept      0  the two armies consisted of about eighty thousand men each but the allies had fortytwo battalions more the french brought eighty pieces of cannon into the field the allies one hundred and forty the duke of marlborough commanded the right wing composed of the english and german troops in english pay prince eugene was in the centre tilli and the count of nassau at the left with the dutch marshal villars took the command of the left wing of his army and left the right to marshal bouflers he had intrenched his army in haste a method perhaps most suitable to his troops that were inferior in numbers and had been a long time unsuccessful and consisted of onehalf recruits it was most suitable likewise to our condition at that time as an entire defeat would have ruined the    nation some historians have found fault with the disposition made by the marshal he should say they have passed a large hollow instead of having it in his front is it not being rather too discerning to judge thus from our closet of what passes on a field of battle all that i know is that the marshal himself said that the soldiers who had had no bread for a whole day and had just had their allowance distributed among them threw half of it away to make the greater haste to come to action there has not been for many ages a longer or more obstinate battle none more bloody i shall say nothing touching this action but what has been universally acknowledged the enemies left wing where the dutch fought was almost entirely cut to pieces and we pursued them with fixed bayonets marlborough at the right made and withstood surprising efforts marshal villars had occasion to thin his centre to oppose marlborough at that very instant the centre was attacked the intrenchments which covered it were carried the regiment of guards who defended them making no resistance the marshal in riding from his left wing to his centre was wounded and the day was lost the field of battle was covered with the bodies of thirty thousand men killed and dying the loss of the french in this battle did not amount to more than eight thousand men the enemy left nearly twentyone thousand killed and wounded but the centre being forced and the two  0 wings cut off those who had made the greatest slaughter lost the day marshal bouflers made a retreat in good order with the assistance of the prince of tingrimontmorency afterward marshal luxembourg inheritor of the valor of his ancestors the army retired between quesnoy and valenciennes carrying with them several standards and colors they had taken from the enemy louis xiv comforted himself with these spoils and it was esteemed a victory to have disputed the day so long and to have lost only the field of battle marshal villars at his return to court assured the king that if he had not been wounded he should have gained the victory i know the general was persuaded of this but i know very few people besides who believe it it may seem surprising that an army which had destroyed nearly twothirds more men than it lost itself should not endeavor to prevent those who had gained no other advantage but that of lying in the midst of their dead from going to lay siege to mons the dutch were fearful for the success of this enterprise and hesitated for some time but the conquered are frequently imposed upon and disheartened by the name of having lost the battle men never do all that they might do and the soldier who is told he is beaten fears to be beaten again thus mons was besieged and taken and all for the dutch who kept possession of this town as they had done of lille and tournay    chapter xxi louis xiv continues to solicit peace and to defend himself—the duke of vendôme secures the king of spain on his throne the enemy not only continued thus advancing by degrees and levelled all the barriers of france on this side but they pretended with the assistance of the duke of savoy to surprise franchecomté and penetrate at once by both ends to the heart of the kingdom general merci who was charged with facilitating this enterprise by entering into upper alsace by the city of basel was happily stopped near the isle of newburg on the rhine by the count afterward marshal dubourg by an unaccountable fatality all those of the name of merci have been as unsuccessful as esteemed this one was defeated most completely nothing was undertaken on the side of savoy but much was apprehended in regard to flanders the domestic affairs of the kingdom were in so languid a state that the king once more solicited peace like a suppliant he offered to acknowledge the archduke for king of spain to withdraw all assistance from his grandson and leave him to his fate to deliver up four places as securities to restore strasburg and breisach to resign the sovereignty of alsace reserving only the prefecture to demolish all the fortified places between basel and philippsburg to fill up the long formidable harbor of dunkirk and demolish its fortifications    and to leave lille tournay ypres menin furnes condé and maubeuge in the hands of the statesgeneral these were in part the articles proposed to serve as a basis for the peace which he solicited the allies determined to have the triumph of discussing the submissive proposals of louis xiv permitted his plenipotentiaries to come to the little town of gertruydenberg in the beginning of the year    0 to present their masters supplications louis made choice of marshal duxelles a man of great coolness and taciturnity and of a disposition rather prudent than elevated or bold with him was joined abbé afterward cardinal polignac one of the brightest wits and most eloquent orators of his age and of a most engaging person and address but wit prudence and eloquence are of no service in a minister when the master is unsuccessful it is conquest that makes treaties the ambassadors of louis xiv were rather confined in gertruydenberg than received there the deputies came to hear their proposals which they transmitted to the hague to prince eugene the duke of marlborough and count zinzendorf ambassador from the emperor these proposals were almost always received with contempt the plenipotentiaries were insulted by the most abusive libels the work of french refugees who were more inveterate enemies to the glory of louis xiv than even prince eugene or the duke of marlborough    though the french plenipotentiaries carried their submission so far as to promise for the king that he should furnish money to dethrone philip v they were not listened to it was insisted upon as a preliminary that louis xiv should engage alone to drive his grandson out of spain by force of arms this absurd piece of inhumanity arose from fresh successes while the allies were thus treating louis xiv like masters irritated against his pride and greatness the city of douay fell into their hands and soon afterward béthune aire and st venant and lord stair proposed to send parties to the gates of paris the archdukes army commanded by guy staremberg the nearest in military reputation to prince eugene of all the german generals gained a complete victory near saragossa on aug  0    0 over that army in which philip and his adherents had placed their hopes and that was commanded by the marquis de bay an unfortunate general here again it was observed that the two rival kings though within reach of their armies were not present at this battle of all the princes for whom europe was then up in arms the duke of savoy was the only one who fought his own battles it was a melancholy consideration that he could acquire his glory only by fighting against his two daughters one of whom he endeavored to dethrone in order to gain a small spot of ground in lombardy about which the emperor joseph already began to make    some difficulties and of which he would have been stripped at the very first opportunity this emperor who was successful everywhere showed no moderation in his good fortune by his own pure authority he dismembered bavaria and bestowed the fiefs thereof on his relatives and creatures he despoiled the young duke of mirandola of his dominions in italy and the princes of the empire maintained an army for him on the rhine without thinking that they were laboring to cement a power of which they stood in dread so much did the old reigning hatred for the name of louis xiv occupy every mind as if their chief interest had been concerned therein joseph had also the good fortune to suppress the rebellious hungarians the court of france had set up prince ragotski against him who came armed with his own pretensions and those of his countrymen ragotski was beaten his town taken and his party ruined thus louis xiv was equally unfortunate abroad and at home by sea and by land in his public negotiations and his private intrigues it was believed by all europe at that time that the archduke charles brother of the fortunate joseph would reign without a competitor in spain europe was threatened with a power more formidable than that of charles v and the english so long the declared foes of the austrianspanish branch and the dutch its revolted slaves were those who exerted themselves to establish it philip v who    had taken refuge in madrid quitted it again and retired to valladolid while the archduke charles made his entry as a conqueror the french king could no longer supply his grandson with aid he had been obliged to do that partly through necessity which the allies had exacted of him at gertruydenberg to abandon the cause of philip by sending for those troops that were yet in spain for his own defence being hardly able to make head against the powerful efforts of the enemy in savoy on the rhine and in flanders where the stress of the war chiefly lay spain was in a still more deplorable situation than france almost all its provinces had been laid waste by its enemies and friends it was attacked by portugal its trade was destroyed there was a general dearth throughout the kingdom but this was more severely felt by the victors than by the vanquished because the common people throughout this great country gave all in their power to philip for whom they had an affection and refused everything to the austrians philip had no longer a general or troops from france the duke of orleans by whom his drooping fortune had been a little raised instead of commanding his army was his enemy it is certain that notwithstanding the affection the inhabitants of madrid had for philip and the fidelity of the grandees and all castile he had still a powerful party against him in spain the catalonians a warlike and headstrong nation were to a man    obstinately attached to his rival onehalf of aragon had likewise been gained over one party of the people waited the outcome of affairs and the other hated the archduke more than they loved philip the duke of orleans the namesake of philip disgusted with the spanish ministry and still more displeased with the princess orsini who governed affairs began to think that he might secure for himself the country which he was sent to defend and when louis xiv himself proposed to give up his grandson and an abdication was already talked of in spain the duke of orleans thought himself worthy of filling the throne which philip v would be obliged to resign he had some pretensions to that place which had been left unnoticed in the king of spains will and which his father had supported by a protest by means of his agents he made an agreement with some of the grandees who engaged to place him on the throne in case philip v should quit it in this case he would have found many of the spaniards ready to enlist under the standard of a prince who was so complete a warrior this scheme had it succeeded could not have displeased the maritime powers as there would have been less apprehension of seeing the kingdoms of france and spain united in one person and fewer obstacles to the peace the project was discovered at madrid about the beginning of   0  while the duke of orleans was at versailles and his agents in spain    were imprisoned philip v never forgave his cousin for thinking him capable of abdicating and endeavoring to succeed him in france the whole kingdom cried out against the duke of orleans the dauphin father of philip v proposed in council to bring the offender to justice but the king chose to pass in silence this abortive and pardonable scheme rather than to punish a nephew at the time that a grandson was on the verge of ruin in fine about the time of the battle of saragossa the spanish council and most of the grandees finding they had no leader to oppose to staremberg whom they looked upon as a second eugene wrote in a body to louis xiv requesting him to send them the duke of vendôme this prince who had retired to anet set out immediately and his presence was as good as an army the spaniards were struck with the great reputation he had gained in italy which the unfortunate campaign of lille had not been able to impair his affability openness and liberality which latter qualification he carried to a degree of profusion and his love for his soldiers won him all hearts the moment he set his foot in spain there happened to him what had formerly happened to bertrand du guesclin his name alone drew a crowd of volunteers he wanted money the corporations of the towns and villages and the religious communities supplied him the nation was seized with a spirit of enthusiasm the scattered troops left after the battle of saragossa assembled together    under him at valladolid in august    0 every place exerted itself in furnishing recruits the duke of vendôme without allowing time for this fresh ardor to cool went in pursuit of the conquerors brought the king back to madrid obliged the enemy to retire toward the frontiers of portugal followed them thither made his army swim the tagus took general stanhope prisoner in brihuega with five thousand english came up with general staremberg at villaviciosa and gave him battle the next day—dec      0 philip v who had not accompanied any of his former generals to the fight animated with the duke of vendômes spirit put himself at the head of the right wing while that general took the left a complete victory was gained over the enemy and in less than four months this great general who had been called in when things were at the last extremity retrieved all and secured the crown forever on the head of philip v while the allies remained confounded at this surprising revolution one of a more secret kind though equally important was preparing in england sarah jennings duchess of marlborough governed queen anne and the duke her husband governed the state he had the treasury at his command through the means of the lord high treasurer godolphin whose son had married one of his daughters his soninlaw sunderland who was secretary of state submitted everything in the cabinet to him and the queens household where his wife had an    unlimited authority was at his devotion he was master of the army while he had the disposal of all offices england was at that time divided between two parties the whigs and the tories the whigs at whose head he was did everything that could contribute to his greatness and the tories had been forced to admire him in silence it is not unworthy of history to add that the duke and duchess were the two handsomest persons of their time and that this advantage contributes not a little to impose on the multitude when accompanied with dignities and honor the duke had more interest at the hague than the pensionary and had great influence in germany had always been successful as a negotiator and general and enjoyed a more extensive share of power and reputation than had ever been the lot of any one private man he could likewise strengthen his power by the immense riches he had acquired during his having command i have heard his widow say that after he had given fortunes to his four children he had remaining independent of any gifts from the crown seventy thousand pounds a year clear money which makes about one million five hundred thousand of our livres had not his frugality been equal to his greatness he might have formed a party in the kingdom that queen anne could not easily have overthrown and had his wife been a little more complaisant the queen would never have broken her  0 chains but the duke could never get the better of his thirst for riches nor the duchess of her capricious temper the queen loved her with a tenderness that went even to submission and a giving up of all will in attachments of this nature we generally find that dislike begins first on the side of the monarch caprice pride and an abuse of superiority are the things which first make the yoke felt and all these the duchess of marlborough heaped upon her mistress with a heavy hand the queen who could not do without a favorite turned her eyes on lady masham one of the ladies of her bedchamber the duchess could not conceal her jealousy it broke out on a thousand occasions a pair of gloves of a particular fashion which she refused the queen and a jar of water that she let fall in her presence upon lady mashams gown by an affected mistake changed the face of affairs in europe matters grew warm between the two parties the new favorites brother asked the duke for a regiment the duke refused it upon which the queen gave it to him herself the tories seized this opportunity to free the queen from her domestic slavery humble the power of the duke change the ministry make peace and if possible replace the stuart family on the throne of england if the disposition of the duchess would have allowed her to make some concessions she might still have retained her power the queen and she had been used to write to each other every day under borrowed names this mysterious    familiarity always left the way open for a reconciliation but the duchess made use of this resource only to make things worse she wrote to the queen in the most insolent terms and among other expressions made use of the following do me justice and make me no answer she soon repented of what she had done and went to ask pardon of the queen with tears in her eyes but her majesty answered you have ordered me not to answer you and i shall not answer you after this the breach was irreparable the duchess appeared no more at court and some time afterward sunderland the dukes soninlaw was removed from the ministry as the first step toward turning out godolphin and then the duke himself in other kingdoms this is called a disgrace in england it is only a change of affairs but this was a change very difficult to be brought about the tories though masters of the queen were not of the kingdom they found themselves obliged to have recourse to religion at present there is little more religion in great britain than what is just sufficient to distinguish factions the whigs inclined to presbyterianism this was the faction that had dethroned james ii persecuted charles ii and brought charles i to the block the tories were in the episcopal interest that favored the house of stuart and wanted to introduce the doctrine of passive obedience to kings because the bishops hoped by that means to have more obedience paid to themselves    a clergyman was procured to preach up this doctrine in st pauls cathedral and to set forth in the most odious light the administration of the duke of marlborough and the measures of the party who had given the crown to king william but notwithstanding that the queen secretly favored this preacher she could not prevent his being silenced for three years by the two houses assembled in westminster hall who ordered his sermon to be burned by the hands of the common hangman she felt her want of power still more sensibly in not daring to indulge the calls of blood in opening a way for her brother to that throne which the whigs had barred against him those writers who say that marlborough and his party fell the instant the queen ceased to support them with her favor know nothing of the affairs of england the queen though now desirous of peace did not dare to remove marlborough from the command of her armies and in the spring of      he was still pursuing his conquests over france though in disgrace at his own court a private agent from france was sent to london to propose conditions of peace underhand but the queens new ministry did not dare to accept them as yet a new event as unforeseen as the others completed this great work the emperor joseph died april         and left the dominions of the house of austria and the german empire together with the pretensions to spain and america to his brother    charles who was elected emperor some months afterward on the first news of his death the prejudices which had put arms into the hands of so many nations began to be dissipated in england by the care of the new ministry the war said they was begun to prevent louis xiv from governing spain america lombardy and the kingdom of naples and sicily in the name of his grandson why then should we endeavor to unite all these kingdoms in the family of charles vi why must the english nation exhaust its treasures we have paid more to the war than germany and holland together the expenses of this year alone amount to seven millions sterling and is the nation to ruin itself for a cause it has no concern with and to procure a part of flanders for the dutch our rivals in trade all these arguments emboldened the queen and opened the eyes of a great part of the nation and a new parliament being called the queen was at liberty to prepare matters for the peace of europe but though she might do this privately she could not as yet publicly break with her allies so that while they were negotiating in the cabinet marlborough was carrying on the service in the field he still continued advancing in flanders where he forced the lines that marshal villars had drawn from montreuil to valenciennes took bouchain advanced as far as quesnoy and from thence was    proceeding in september      toward paris which had not a single rampart to oppose him it was at this unfortunate period that the famous duguaytrouin who had not as yet any rank in the sea service and owed everything to himself by his own courage and the assistance of some merchants who furnished him with money fitted out a small fleet and sailed to brazil where he took one of the principal cities called st sebastian de rio janeiro he and his crew returned home loaded with riches and the portuguese lost even more than he had gained but the mischief that he had done in brazil did not alleviate the miseries of france chapter xxii victory gained by marshal villars at denain—the affairs of france retrieved—the general peace the negotiations which were now openly set on foot in london proved more salutary the queen sent the earl of strafford ambassador to holland to communicate to the states the proposals made by louis xiv marlboroughs leave was no longer asked the earl of strafford obliged the dutch to name plenipotentiaries and to receive those of france three private persons still continued to oppose the peace these were marlborough prince eugene and heinsius who persisted in their intention of    crushing louis xiv but when the english general returned to london at the close of the campaign in      he was deprived of all his prestige he found a new house of commons and had no longer the majority in the house of lords the queen by creating a number of new peers had weakened the dukes party and strengthened the crown interest he was now accused like scipio of malfeasance and like that hero extricated himself by his reputation and by retiring he was still powerful though in disgrace prince eugene himself came over to london purposely to strengthen his party this prince met with the reception due to his birth and reputation but his proposals were rejected the court interest prevailed prince eugene returned to end the war alone with the fresh incentive of a prospect of victory without a companion to divide the honor while the congress was assembling at utrecht and the french plenipotentiaries who had been so ill used at gertruydenberg now returned to treat upon more equal terms marshal villars lay behind his lines to cover arras and cambray prince eugene took the town of quesnoy and overspread the country with an army of a hundred thousand men the dutch had exerted themselves and though they had never before furnished their whole quota toward the necessary expenses of the war they had this year exceeded their contingent queen anne could not as yet openly disengage herself from them she had sent the duke of ormond to join    prince eugenes army with twelve thousand english and still kept in pay a number of german troops prince eugene after burning the suburbs of arras advanced toward the french army and proposed to the duke of ormond to give them battle but the english general had been sent with orders not to fight the private negotiations between england and france drew toward a conclusion a suspension of arms was proclaimed between the two crowns louis xiv put dunkirk into the hands of the english as a security for the performance of his engagements the duke of ormond then retired toward ghent he endeavored to take with him the troops that were in the queens pay but none would follow him except four squadrons of the regiment of holstein and one regiment of liège the troops of brandenburg saxony hesse and denmark remained with prince eugene and were paid by the dutch the elector of hanover himself who was to succeed queen anne on the throne of england notwithstanding her remonstrances continued his troops in the pay of the allies which plainly showed that the pretensions of his family to the crown of england did not depend on queen annes favor prince eugene though deprived of the assistance of the english was still superior by twenty thousand men to the french army he was likewise superior by his position by the great plenty of magazines and by nine years of continued victories marshal villars could not prevent him from laying    siege to landrecy france exhausted of men and money was in consternation and people placed no great dependence on the conferences at utrecht which might be all overthrown by the successes of prince eugene several considerable detachments had already entered champagne and ravaged the country and advanced as far as the gates of rheims the alarm was now as great at versailles as in the rest of the kingdom the death of the kings only son which occurred this year the duke of burgundy the duchess his wife and their eldest son all carried to their graves the same day and the only remaining child at the point of death all these domestic misfortunes added to those from without and the sufferings of the people made the close of louis xivs reign considered as a time pointed out for calamities and everyone expected to see more disasters than they had formerly seen greatness and glory precisely at this period the duke of vendôme died in spain the general despondency which seized upon the french nation on this occasion of which i remember to have been a witness filled them with apprehensions lest spain which had been supported by the duke of vendôme should fall with him as landrecy could not hold out long it was debated at versailles whether the king should retire to chambord on this occasion he told marshal dharcourt that in case of any fresh misfortune he would assemble the nobility of his kingdom lead    them in person against the enemy notwithstanding he was now over seventy and die fighting at their head a fault committed by prince eugene delivered the king and kingdom from these dreadful disquietudes it is said that his lines were too much extended that his magazines at marchiennes were at too great a distance and that general albemarle who was posted between denain and the princes camp was not within reach of assisting him soon enough in case he was attacked i have been assured that a beautiful italian lady whom i saw some time afterward at the hague and whom prince eugene then kept lived at marchienneaupont and that it was on her account that this was made a place for magazines it is doing injustice to prince eugene to suppose that a woman could have any share in his military arrangements but when we know that a curate and a counsellor of douay named le fevre dorval walking together in those quarters first conceived the idea that denain and marchienneaupont might easily be attacked this will better serve to prove by what secret and weak springs the great affairs of this world are often directed le fevre communicated his notion to the intendant of the province and he to marshal montesquieu who commanded under marshal villars the general approved of the scheme and put it into execution to this action in fact france owed her safety more than to the peace she made with england    marshal villars misled prince eugene a body of dragoons were ordered to advance in sight of the enemys camp as if going to attack it and while these dragoons retired toward guise the marshal on july         marched towards denain with his army drawn up in five columns and forced general albemarles intrenchments defended by seventeen battalions who were all killed or made prisoners of war with two princes of the house of nassau the prince of holstein the prince of anhalt and all the officers of the detachment prince eugene marched in haste to their assistance but did not come up till the action was over and in endeavoring to get possession of a bridge that led to denain he lost a number of his men and was obliged to return to his camp after having been witness of this defeat all the posts along the scarpe as far as marchienneaupont were carried one after another with the utmost rapidity the army then pushed directly for marchienneaupont which was defended by four thousand men the siege was carried on with the greatest vigor and in three days the garrison were made prisoners of war and all the ammunition and provisions that the enemy had laid up for the whole campaign fell into our hands the superiority was now wholly on the side of marshal villars the enemy discouraged raised the siege of landrecy and soon afterward saw douay quesnoy and bouchain retaken by our troops the frontiers  00 were now in safety prince eugene drew off his army after having lost nearly fifty battalions forty of whom were made prisoners between the fight of denain and the end of the campaign the most signal victory could not have produced greater advantages had marshal villars been possessed of the same share of popular favor as some other generals he would have been publicly called the restorer of france instead of which they hardly acknowledged the obligations they were under to him and envy prevailed over the public joy for this unexpected success every step of marshal de villars hastened the peace of utrecht queen annes ministry as answerable to their country and to europe for their actions neglected nothing that concerned the interest of england and its allies and the safety of the public weal in the first place they insisted that philip v now settled on the throne of spain should renounce his right to the crown of france which he had hitherto constantly maintained and that the duke of berry his brother presumptive heir to that crown after the only remaining greatgrandson of louis xiv then at the point of death should likewise renounce all pretensions to the crown of spain in case he should come to be king of france they exacted the same on the part of the duke of orleans the late twelve years war had shown how little men are to be bound by such acts there  0  is no one known law that obliges the descendants of a prince to give up their right to a throne because their father may have renounced it these renunciations are of no effect except when the common interest is in concert with them however they served to calm for the present a twelve years storm and it is probable that one day several nations may join to support these renunciations that are now the basis of the balance of power and the tranquillity of europe by this treaty the island of sicily was given to the duke of savoy with the title of king and on the continent the towns of fenestrelles exilles with the valley of pragilas so that they took from the house of bourbon to aggrandize him the dutch had a considerable barrier given them which they had always been aiming at and if the house of bourbon was despoiled of some territories in favor of the duke of savoy the house of austria was on the other hand stripped to satisfy the dutch who were at its expense the guaranties and masters of the strongest cities of flanders due regard was paid to the interest of the dutch with respect to trade and there was an article stipulated in favor of the portuguese the sovereignty of the ten provinces of the spanish netherlands was reserved for the emperor together with the advantageous lordship of the barrier towns they also guaranteed to him the kingdom of naples and sicily with all his possessions in  0  lombardy and the four ports on the coast of tuscany but the court of vienna would not subscribe to these conditions as thinking she had not sufficient justice done her as to england her glory and interest were sufficiently secured she had obtained the demolition of the harbor and fortifications of dunkirk which had been the object of so much jealousy she was left in possession of gibraltar and the island of minorca by spain france ceded to her hudsons bay the island of newfoundland and acadia and she procured greater privileges for her american trade than had been granted even to the french who placed philip v on the throne we must also reckon among the glorious acts of the english ministry its having engaged louis xiv to consent to set at liberty those of his subjects who were confined in prison on account of their religion this was dictating laws but laws of a very respectable nature lastly queen anne sacrificing the rights of blood and the secret inclinations of her heart to the desires of her country secured the succession to the crown of great britain to the house of hanover as to the electors of bavaria and cologne the former was to keep the duchy of luxemburg and the county of namur till his brother and himself should be restored to their electorates for spain had ceded those two sovereignties to the elector of bavaria as a consideration for his losses and the allies had taken neither of them during the war  0  france who demolished dunkirk and gave up so many places in flanders that her arms had formerly conquered and that had been secured to her by the treaties of nimeguen and ryswick got back lille aire béthune and st venant thus did the english ministry to all appearance do justice to everyone but this was denied them by the whigs and onehalf of the nation reviled the memory of queen anne for having done the greatest good that a sovereign possibly could do in giving peace to so many nations she was reproached with not having dismembered france when it was in her power to do it all these treaties were signed one after another in the course of the year      but whether it was owing to the obstinacy of prince eugene or to the bad politics of the emperors council that monarch did not enter into any of these negotiations he would certainly have had landau and perhaps strasburg had he at first fallen in with the views of queen anne and her ministry but he was bent on continuing the war and so got nothing marshal villars having secured the rest of french flanders marched toward the rhine and after making himself master of spires worms and all the adjacent country he took landau which the emperor might have had by acceding to the peace forced the lines that prince eugene had ordered to be drawn from breisgau defeated marshal vaubonne who defended those lines and lastly  0  besieged and took freiburg the capital of upper austria the council of vienna pressed the circles of the empire to send the reinforcements they had promised but none came they now began to be sensible that the emperor without the assistance of england and holland could never prevail against france and resolved upon peace when it was too late marshal villars after having thus put an end to the war had the additional honor of concluding the peace with prince eugene at rastatt this was perhaps the first time that two generals of opposite parties had been known to meet together at the close of a campaign to treat in the names of their masters they both brought with them that openness of character for which they were distinguished i have heard marshal villars relate that one of the first things he said to prince eugene was this sir we do not meet as enemies your enemies are at vienna and mine at versailles and in fact both of them had always cabals to combat at their respective courts in this treaty there was no notice taken of the pretensions which the emperor still maintained to the spanish monarchy nor of the empty title of catholic king that he continued to bear after philip v was in quiet possession of the kingdom louis xiv kept strasburg and landau which he had before offered to give up huninguen and new breisach which he had proposed to demolish and  0  the sovereignty of alsace which he had offered to renounce but what was still more honorable for him he procured the reinstatement of the electors of cologne and bavaria in their ranks and dominions it is a remarkable circumstance that france in all her treaties with the emperors has constantly protected the rights of the princes and states of the empire she laid the foundation of the germanic liberties by the peace of münster and caused an eighth electorate to be erected in favor of this very house of bavaria the treaty of westphalia was confirmed by that of nimeguen by the treaty of ryswick she procured all the estate of cardinal furstemberg to be restored to him lastly by this peace of utrecht she obtained the reestablishment of the two electors it must be acknowledged that throughout the whole negotiation which put an end to this long quarrel france received laws from england and imposed them on the empire the historical memoirs of those times from which so many histories of louis xiv have been compiled say that prince eugene when he had finished the conferences desired the duke de villars to embrace the knees of louis xiv for him and to present that monarch in his name with assurances of the most profound respect of a subject toward his sovereign in the first place it is not true that a prince the grandson of a sovereign can be the subject of another prince because he was born in his  0  dominions and in the second place it is still less so that prince eugene vicargeneral of the empire could call himself the subject of the king of france and now each state took possession of its new rights the duke of savoy got himself acknowledged in sicily without consulting the emperor who complained of it in vain louis xiv procured entrance for his troops into lille the dutch seized on their barrier towns and the states of the country gave them one million two hundred and fifty thousand florins a year to continue masters in flanders louis xiv filled up the harbor of dunkirk razed the citadel and demolished the fortifications toward the sea in presence of the english commissary the inhabitants who saw their whole trade ruined thereby sent a deputation over to london to implore the clemency of queen anne it was a mortifying circumstance to louis xiv that his subjects should go to ask favors of a queen of england but it was still more melancholy for these poor people to meet with a refusal from the queen the king some time afterward enlarged the canal of mardyke and by means of sluices formed a harbor there which was thought already to equal that of dunkirk the earl of stair ambassador from england complained of this in warm terms to the king it is said in one of the best books we have that louis xiv made him this reply my lord i have always been master in my own kingdom sometimes in those of others do not put me in remembrance  0  of it i know of my own certain knowledge that louis xiv never made so improper a reply he was far from ever having been master in england he was indeed master in his own kingdom but the point in question was whether he was master of eluding a treaty to which he owed his repose and perhaps the greatest part of his kingdom this however is true that he put a stop to the works of mardyke and thus yielded to the remonstrances of the ambassador instead of braving them the works of the canal of mardyke were demolished soon afterward during the regency and the treaty accomplished in every point notwithstanding the peace of utrecht and that of rastatt philip v was not yet in possession of all spain he still had catalonia to conquer and the islands of majorca and ivica it is necessary to know that the emperor charles having left his wife at barcelona and finding himself unable to carry on a war in spain and yet unwilling to give up his claim or accept of the peace of utrecht had nevertheless made an agreement with queen anne for a squadron of english ships to bring away the empress and the troops now useless in catalonia in fact catalonia had been already evacuated and staremberg when he quitted that province had resigned his title of viceroy but he left behind him all the seeds of a civil war those who had the most credit in that province imagined that they might be able to form a republic under a  0  foreign protection and that the king of spain would not be strong enough to subdue them on this occasion they displayed that character which tacitus gave them so long since who calls them an intrepid people that count their lives for nothing when not employed in fighting if they had made half the efforts for philip v their king that they then did against him the archduke would never have disputed spain by the obstinate resistance they made they proved that philip though delivered from his competitor was not able to reduce them by his own power louis xiv who during the latter part of the war had not been able to assist his grandson with either ships or soldiers against his rival charles now sent him aid against his rebellious subjects a fleet of french ships blocked up the harbor of barcelona and marshal berwick laid siege to it by land the queen of england faithful to her treaty would not assist this city the emperor made a vain promise of relief the besieged defended themselves with a courage that was fortified by fanaticism the priests and monks ran to arms and mounted the trenches as if it had been a religious war a phantom of liberty rendered them deaf to all the advances made to them by their master more than five hundred ecclesiastics died during this siege with their arms in their hands we may judge whether by their speeches and examples they helped to animate the people  0  they hung out a black ensign on the breach and withstood several assaults at length the besiegers having made their way into the town the besieged disputed street after street and having retreated into the new town after the old one was taken they offered to capitulate on condition of being allowed all their privileges but they obtained only their lives and estates most of their privileges were taken from them sixty monks were condemned to the galleys and this was the only vengeance taken by the conquerors philip v had during the war treated the little town of xativa much more severely by ordering it to be razed from the foundation as an example but though he might do this to a town of no importance he would not destroy a large city that had a fine seaport and was of use to the state this fury of the catalans that had not exerted itself while charles vi was among them and which transported them to such extremes when they were left without assistance was the last spark of that flame which had been lighted up by the will of charles ii king of spain and had so long laid waste the most beautiful part of europe chapter xxiii private anecdotes of the reign of louis xiv anecdotes are a sort of confined field where we glean after the plentiful harvest of history they   0 are small narratives which have long been secreted whence they receive the name of anecdotes and when they concern any illustrious personages are sure to engage the public attention plutarchs lives is but a collection of anecdotes rather entertaining than true how could he have procured faithful accounts of the private life of theseus or lycurgus most of the maxims which he puts into the mouths of his heroes advance moral virtue rather than historical truth the secret history of justinian by procopius is a satire dictated by revenge and though revenge may speak the truth this satire which contradicts his public history has not always the appearance of it we now are not allowed to imitate even plutarch much less procopius we admit as historical truths none but what are well supported when contemporaries like the cardinal de retz and the duke de rochefoucauld inveterate enemies to each other confirm the same transaction in both their accounts of it that transaction cannot be doubted when they contradict each other we must doubt them what does not come within the bounds of probability can deserve no credit unless several contemporaries of unblemished reputation join unanimously in the assertion the most useful and most valuable anecdotes are those secret papers which great princes leave behind them in which their minds have thrown off all     reserve such are those i am now going to relate of louis xiv domestic occurrences amuse only the curious the discovery of weaknesses entertains only the malignant except where these weaknesses instruct either by their fatal consequences or those virtues which prevented the impending misfortune secret anecdotes of contemporaries are liable to the charge of partiality they who write at any considerable distance of time should use the greatest circumspection should discard what is trifling reduce what is extravagant and soften what is satirical louis xiv was so magnificent in his court as well as in his reign that the least particulars of his private life seem to interest posterity as they drew the attention of all the courts of europe and of all his contemporaries the splendor of his government threw a light on his most trivial actions we are more eager especially in france to know the transactions of his court than the revolutions of other states such is the effect of a great reputation we had rather be informed of what passed in the cabinet and court of augustus than hear a full detail of the conquests of attila or tamerlane hence all who have written the history of louis xiv have been very exact in dating his first attachment to the baroness of beauvais to mademoiselle dargencourt to cardinal mazarins niece who was married to the count of soissons prince eugenes     father and quite elaborate in setting forth his passion for maria mancini that princes sister who was afterward married to constable colonne he had not assumed the reins of empire when these amusements busied and plunged him into that languid state in which cardinal mazarin who governed with a despotic sway permitted him to remain his bare attachment to maria mancini was an affair of great importance for he was so passionately fond of her as to be tempted to marry her and yet was sufficiently master of himself to quit her entirely this victory which he gained over his passion made the first discovery of the greatness of his soul he gained a more severe and difficult conquest in leaving cardinal mazarin in possession of absolute sway gratitude prevented him from shaking off that yoke which now began to grow too heavy it was a wellknown anecdote at court that after the cardinals death he said i do not know what i should have done had he lived any longer  he employed this season of leisure in reading     books of entertainment and especially in company with the constable who as well as his sisters had a facetious turn he delighted in poetry and romances which secretly flattered his own character by pointing out the beauty of gallantry and heroism he read the tragedies of corneille and formed that taste which was the result of solid sense and of that readiness of sentiment which is the characteristic of a real genius the conversation of his mother and the court ladies contributed very much to give him this taste and that peculiar delicacy which began now to distinguish the court of france anne of austria had brought with her a kind of generous and bold gallantry not unlike the spanish disposition in those days to this she had added politeness sweetness and a decent liberty peculiar to the french only the king made greater progress in this school of entertainment from eighteen to twenty than he had all his life in that of the sciences under his tutor abbé beaumont afterward archbishop of paris he had very little learning of this last sort it would have been better had he at least been instructed in history especially the modern but what they had at that time was very indifferently written he was uneasy at having perused nothing but idle romances and the disagreeableness he found in necessary studies a translation of cæsars commentaries was printed in his name and one of florus in that of his brother but those princes had no other hand     in them than having thrown away their time in writing a few observations on some passages in those authors he who was chief director of the kings education under the first marshal villeroi his governor was well qualified for the task was learned and agreeable but the civil wars spoiled his education and cardinal mazarin was content he should be kept in the dark when he conceived a passion for maria mancini he soon learned italian to converse with her and at his marriage he applied himself to spanish but with less success his neglect of study in his youth a fearfulness of exposing himself and the ignorance in which cardinal mazarin kept him persuaded the whole court that he would make just such a king as his father louis xiii there was only one circumstance from which those capable of forming a judgment of future events could foresee the figure he would make this was in      after the civil wars after his first campaign and consecration when the parliament was about to meet on account of some edicts the king went from vincennes in a hunting dress attended by his whole court and entering the parliament chamber in jackboots and his whip in his hand made use of these very words the mischiefs your assemblies produce are well known i command you to break up those you have begun upon my edicts m president i forbid you to     permit these assemblies and any of you to demand them his height already majestic his noble action the masterly tone and air he spoke with affected them more than the authority due to his rank which hitherto they had not much respected but these blossoms of his greatness seemed to fall off a moment after nor did the fruits appear till after the cardinals death the court after the triumphant return of mazarin amused itself with play with balls with comedies which being but just produced in france had not grown into an art and with tragedies which were now a sublime science through the management of peter corneille a curate of st germain who inclined toward the rigorous precepts of the jansenists had frequently written to the queen against these shows from the very beginning of her regency he pretended that those were damned who attended them and had this anathema signed by seven doctors of the sorbonne but abbé beaumont the kings preceptor defended them by the approbation of more doctors than the rigid priest could procure to condemn them thus he quieted the queens scruples and when he was archbishop of paris gave the sanction of authority to that opinion which he had defended when only an abbé i must observe that after cardinal richelieu had introduced at court regular plays which have at last raised paris to rival athens there was not     only a bench appointed for academics—in which body were several ecclesiastics—but one in particular for the bishops cardinal mazarin in      and      had italian operas performed by voices which he brought from italy in the theatre of the royal palace and at the little bourbon near the louvre this new entertainment had just arisen at florence a country favored at that time by fortune as well as nature to which we owe the revival of many arts lost in the preceding centuries and the invention of new ones france showed some relics of her ancient barbarity in opposing the establishment of these arts the jansenists whom cardinals richelieu and mazarin wanted to keep under revenged themselves upon these diversions which these two ministers had introduced the lutherans and calvinists had acted the same part in the time of pope leo x besides their opposition was sufficient to gain them the character of austerity the same men who would overturn a state to establish opinions frequently absurd anathematized the innocent pleasures necessary in so large a city and the arts which contributed to the splendor of the nation abolishing these diversions was an act more worthy of the age of attila than that of louis xiv dancing which may now be reckoned among the arts  because it is tied down to rules and adds grace     to motion was one of the greatest amusements of the court louis xiii had only danced once at a ball in      and that ball was in so bad taste that it did not in the least presage the appearance this art made in france thirty years after louis xiv excelled in grave dances which were agreeable to the majesty of his figure and did not injure that of his rank at the running at the ring which was sometimes performed with great splendor he showed that peculiar dexterity which he had at all exercises pleasure and magnificence such as they then were diffused themselves universally but they were nothing in comparison with what appeared when the king sat on the throne and yet might be reckoned amazing after the horrors of a civil war and the dulness of the retired and melancholy life of louis xiii that prince without health and spirits had neither been attended lodged nor equipped as a king he had not above a hundred thousand crowns worth of jewels belonging to the crown cardinal mazarin little more than doubled that sum and now we have jewels to the amount of above twenty millions of livres at the marriage of louis xiv in    0 everything assumed an air of the highest taste and magnificence and this increased daily when he made     his entry with his queen consort paris saw with a respectful and tender admiration that beautiful young queen drawn in a superb car of a new invention the king rode on horseback by her side adorned with all that art could add to his manly and heroic beauty which drew universal attention at the end of the streets of vincennes a triumphal arch was built the foundation of which was stone but the shortness of the time would not permit them to finish it with such durable materials the rest was only plaster and has since been pulled down it was designed by claude perrault the gate of st anthony was rebuilt for the same ceremony a monument of no very noble taste but adorned with some good pieces of sculpture all who had seen the day of the battle of st anthony and the dead and dying bodies of the citizens brought to paris through this gate then furnished with a portcullis and who beheld this entry so extremely different blessed heaven and returned their thanks for so happy a change cardinal mazarin added to the solemnity of this marriage the representation of an italian opera in the louvre called hercules in love this did not please the french they saw nothing in it that entertained them but the king and queen who danced the cardinal wanted to signalize himself by a play more to the taste of the nation the secretary of state at lyons undertook to have a sort of allegorical tragedy after the taste of that of     europa in which cardinal richelieu had some hand the great corneille was happy in not being chosen to work upon such poor materials the subject was lisis and hesperia lisis signified france and hesperia spain quinault who had just won a reputation by his false tiberinus which though a bad piece had amazing success was set to work at it the lisis had not the same fate it was acted at the louvre and had nothing good in it but the machinery the marquis of sourdiac of the name of rieux to whom france was afterward indebted for the establishment of the opera acted at the same time at his own expense in his castle of newbourg the golden fleece by peter corneille with machinery quinault a youth of genteel figure was supported by the court corneille by his name and the nation there was one continued train of feasts pleasures and gallantry after the kings marriage which increased on that of the kings brother with henrietta of england sister of charles ii and was not interrupted till the death of cardinal mazarin in      some months after the death of this minister an event happened which was not to be paralleled and what is no less strange is unnoticed by all the historians an unknown prisoner of majestic height young of a graceful and noble figure was sent with the utmost secrecy to the castle on st margarets island in the see of provence this   0 prisoner on the road wore a mask the chin of which was composed of steel springs which gave him liberty to eat with his mask on orders were given to kill him if he discovered himself he remained on the island till an officer of tried fidelity named st mars governor of pignerol was made governor of the bastille in    0 he went to the island of st margaret and brought him to the bastille with his mask on all the way the marquis de louvois went to see him on that island before his departure and spoke to him with great respect and without sitting down this stranger was brought to the bastille and lodged as well as he could be in that castle he was refused nothing that he desired his greatest pleasure was extraordinary fine linen and laces he played on the guitar he was much caressed and the governor seldom sat down in his presence an old physician of the bastille who had frequently attended this strange gentleman in his illness declared he never saw his face though he had frequently examined his tongue and other parts of his body this physician said that he was rather brown but extremely well made the very tone of his voice was engaging but he never complained of his situation and never disclosed who he was  this stranger died in   0  and was buried at     night in the parish of st paul what redoubles our astonishment is that when he was sent to the isle of st margaret no person of any consequence disappeared in europe this prisoner was however doubtless a man of high rank for on his first arrival on the island the governor himself set the silver plates upon his table and then retired after securing the door one day the prisoner wrote upon a silver plate with the point of a knife and threw the plate out of the window toward a boat which was on the river near the foot of the tower a fisherman to whom the boat belonged took up the plate and brought it to the governor he with great eagerness asked the fisherman have you read what is written upon this plate or has anyone seen it since you had it the fisherman answered i do not know how to read i have just found it and nobody has seen it the peasant was detained till the governor was convinced that he never could read and that the plate had been seen by no other person go said he you are happy in not knowing how to read there are some very credible witnesses of this fact who are now living m chamillard was the last person who knew anything of this strange secret the second marshal de feuillade his soninlaw told me that at the death of his fatherinlaw he conjured him on his knees to tell him who that person was who was never known but by the name of the man with the iron mask chamillard answered     him that it was a secret of state and that he had taken an oath never to reveal it in fine there are many of my contemporaries who will attest the truth of what i advance nor do i know any one fact so extraordinary and so well supported louis xiv meanwhile divided his time between the pleasures agreeable to his age and the duties of his station he held a council daily and then studied in secret with colbert this secret labor was the original cause of the disgrace of the famous fouquet in which the secretary of state gunegaud pellisson and many others were included the fall of this minister who perhaps was less to blame than cardinal mazarin showed that all people have not the liberty of committing the same faults his ruin was already determined when the king accepted that magnificent feast with which this minister entertained him in his house at vaux this palace and gardens had cost him eighteen millions of livres which were then as much as thirtysix millions would be now he had built the palace twice and bought three entire villages the land of which was all enclosed in these immense gardens laid out by lenôtre and then esteemed the finest in all europe the fountains of vaux which made no indifferent appearance after even those of versailles of marly and st cloud were at that time prodigies but the expense of eighteen millions the accounts of which are now in existence show that he was served with as little economy as he     served the king the palaces of st germain and fontainebleau the only pleasure houses the king had certainly were not to compare with vaux louis xiv observed it and was piqued throughout the whole house were to be seen the arms of fouquet a squirrel with this motto quo non ascendam—where shall i not ascend the king had it explained to him the ambition of this device did not contribute to appease the monarch the courtiers observed that the squirrel was everywhere painted as pursued by an adder which was the arms of colbert the entertainment exceeded any cardinal mazarin had ever given not only in magnificence but also in taste there for the first time was acted the impertinents of molière pellisson had made the prologue which was much admired public pleasures so often conceal or prepare the court for private disasters that had it not been for the queenmother the superintendent and pellisson would have been arrested at vaux the very day of the feast what inflamed the resentment of his master was that mademoiselle la vallière for whom the king began to feel a lively passion had been one of the objects of the superintendents loose desires who spared nothing to satisfy them he had offered la vallière two hundred thousand livres which she had rejected with scorn before she had formed any design upon the heart of the king the superintendent soon perceiving what a powerful rival he had aimed at     being the confidant of her of whom he could not be the possessor and this too enraged his majesty the king who in the first heat of his resentment was tempted to arrest the superintendent in the very middle of the entertainment he received from him afterward dissembled when it was not necessary it was said that the monarch now in full power dreaded fouquets party he was attorneygeneral to the parliament and this office gave him the privilege of being tried by the united chambers but after so many princes marshals and dukes had been tried by commissaries they might have given the same treatment to a magistrate who would make use of such extraordinary measures as though they might not really be unjust might raise a suspicion of their being so colbert persuaded him by no very honorable artifice to sell his office and he parted with it for twelve hundred thousand livres which now represents above two millions the immoderate price of places belonging to the parliament so greatly diminished in value since that time shows the high estimation in which this body was still held even in its state of depression the duke of guise great chamberlain to the king had not sold this office of the crown to the duke of bouillon for more than eight hundred thousand livres though fouquet squandered the revenues of the state and used them as his own proper income he     had still much greatness of soul what he embezzled he spent in magnificence and acts of liberality he caused the money which he had for his place to be brought into the kings privy treasury yet this noble action did not save him they drew a man by artifice to nantes whom one exempt and two soldiers might have seized at paris the king caressed him before his disgrace i know not why most princes commonly affect to deceive by false appearances of favor those among their subjects whom they mean to ruin at such times dissimulation is the opposite to greatness it never is a virtue and cannot become a valuable accomplishment except when absolute necessity enforces it louis xiv seemed to act out of character but he was made to understand that fouquet was about raising considerable fortifications in belleisle and that he possibly might have too many connections both without and within the kingdom it plainly appeared at the time in which he was arrested and carried to the bastille and to vincennes that the strength of his party lay only in the avarice of some courtiers and certain women who received pensions from him and forgot him the moment he was no longer able to bestow them the only friends he had left were pellisson gourville mademoiselle scudéri such as were involved in his disgrace and some men of letters the verses of hainault the translator of lucretius against colbert the persecutor of fouquet are well known       ministre avare  lâche esclave malheureux   qui gémis sous le poids des affaires publiques   victime dévouée aux chagrins

him about this libellous sonnet asked whether the king was offended with it and upon being told he was not so neither am i replied the minister it is true that the commencing of a process against the superintendent would be impeaching the memory of cardinal mazarin for the most considerable     depredations of the finances were his doings he like a despotic sovereign had appointed to himself several branches of the public revenue he had treated in his own name and to his own advantage for military stores he had imposed says fouquet in his defence by lettres de cachet extraordinary sums on the generalities which was never done but by him and for his behalf a proceeding which was punishable with death according to the royal ordinances it was in this manner the cardinal amassed immense riches and these even unknown to himself i have heard the late m de caumartin intendant of the finances relate that in his youth some years after the death of the cardinal he had been in the palais mazarin where the duke his heir and the duchess hortense resided that he saw there a large press or cabinet which was very deep and from top to bottom took up the whole height of the closet where it stood the key had been lost for some time so that the drawers had not been opened m caumartin surprised at the oversight said to the duchess of mazarin that probably some curiosities might be found in this press it was accordingly opened and was quite full of the coin called quadruples also gold counters and medals of the same metal of this madame mazarin threw handfuls to the people out of the windows for over eight days the abuse which cardinal mazarin made of his arbitrary power did not justify the superintendent     but the irregularity of the proceedings against him the tediousness of his process time which extinguishes public envy and inspires peoples minds with compassion for the unhappy together with solicitations always more active in favor of an unfortunate person than means employed to ruin him all these together saved his life judgment was not given in the process till three years after in      and of the twentytwo judges who gave sentence only nine made it capital the other thirteen among whom there were some that gourville had prevailed on to accept of presents were in favor of perpetual banishment but the king commuted the punishment into one still more severe for he was confined in the castle of pignerol all the historians say that he died there in    0 but gourville assures us in his memoirs that he was released from prison some time before his death the countess of vaux his daughterinlaw had before strongly averred this fact to me though the contrary is believed among his own family thus one knows not in what place died an unfortunate man whose least actions while he was in power were striking gunegaud the secretary of state who sold his place to colbert was no less pursued by the chamber of justice who stripped him of the greatest part of his fortune st évremond who had a particular friendship for the superintendent was involved in his disgrace colbert who searched everywhere for proofs against     him whom he had a mind to ruin caused some papers to be seized that were intrusted to the care of madame duplessisbellièvre among which was found a manuscript letter of st évremonds upon the peace of the pyrenees this piece of pleasantry which was represented as a crime against the state was read to the king colbert who scorned to avenge himself upon hainault a person of an obscure character persecuted in st évremond the friend of fouquet whom he hated and the fine genius which he dreaded the king was so extremely severe as to punish an innocent piece of raillery composed some time before against cardinal mazarin whom he himself had not regretted and whom the whole court had insulted reproached and proscribed for several years with impunity among a thousand pieces written against this minister the least poignant was the only one which was punished and that after his death st évremond having retired into england lived and died there with the freedom of a man and a philosopher the marquis de miremont his friend formerly told me in london that there was another reason for his disgrace which st évremond would never be prevailed upon to explain the new minister of the finances under the simple title of comptrollergeneral justified the severity of his proceedings in reestablishing the order which his predecessors in office had broken through and   0 by laboring indefatigably to promote the grandeur of the state the court became the centre of pleasure and the model for the imitation of other courts the king piqued himself on giving feasts or entertainments which obliterated the remembrance of that made by the count of vaux it seemed that nature took delight at that time to produce in france some of the greatest men in all the arts and to assemble at court the most beautiful and best made persons of both sexes the king excelled all his courtiers in the proper dignity of his stature and the majestic beauty of his features the tone of his voice noble and striking gained those hearts which his presence intimidated he had a gait which could suit none but himself and his high rank and would have been ridiculous in any other the embarrassment into which he threw those who spoke to him secretly flattered the complaisance with which he felt his own superiority that old officer who being somewhat confounded faltered in his speech on asking him a favor and being unable to finish his discourse told him sire i do not tremble thus before your enemies easily obtained his demand the relish of society had not as yet received all its perfection at court anne of austria the queenmother began to love retirement the reigning queen hardly understood the french tongue and goodness constituted her only merit the princess     of england sisterinlaw of the king brought to court the charms of a soft and animated conversation which was soon improved by the reading of good books and by a solid and delicate taste she perfected herself in the knowledge of the language which she wrote but badly at the time of her marriage she inspired an emulation of genius that was new and introduced at court a politeness and such graces as the rest of europe had hardly any idea of madame possessed all the vivacity of her brother charles ii being adorned with the charms of her own sex and both the power and desire of pleasing the court of louis xiv breathed a gallantry full of decorum whilst that which reigned at the court of charles ii was of a freer kind and being too much unpolished dishonored its pleasures there passed at first between madame and the king a good deal of that coquetry of wit and secret sympathy which were observable in little feasts often repeated the king sent her copies of verses and she answered him in like manner it happened that the very same person was confidant both to the king and madame in this ingenious commerce and this was marquis de dangeau the king commissioned the marquis to write for him and the princess also engaged him to answer the king he thus served both of them without giving any grounds for suspicion to the one that he was     employed by the other and this was one of the causes of his making his fortune this intelligence had alarmed the royal family but the king converted the noise made by this commerce into an invariable source of esteem and friendship when madame afterward engaged racine and corneille to write the tragedy of bérénice she had in view not only the rupture of the king with constable colonna but the restraint which she herself put upon her own inclinations lest they should have a dangerous tendency louis xiv is sufficiently pointed out in these two lines of racines bérénice   quen quelque obscurité que le ciel leût fait naître   le monde en le voyant eût reconnu son mâitre   his birth howeer obscure his race unknown   the world in him its sovereign chief would own these amusements gave way to the more serious and regularly pursued passion which he entertained for mademoiselle de la vallière maid of honor to madame he tasted with her the happiness of being beloved purely for his own sake she had been for two years the secret object of all the gallant amusements and feasts which the king had given a young valet de chambre to the king called belloc composed several recitatives intermixed with dances which were performed sometimes at the queens and sometimes at madames and these recitatives mysteriously expressed the secret of their hearts which soon ceased being any longer so     all the public diversions which the king gave were so many pieces of homage paid to his mistress in      a carrousal tilt was held near the tuileries in a space which still retains the name of la place du carrousel in it were five quadrilles or parties the king was at the head of the romans his brother at that of the persians the prince of condé of the turks the duke denghien his son headed the indians and the duke of guise the americans this duke of guise was the grandson of balafré he had made himself famous in the world for the unfortunate temerity with which he had undertaken to make himself master of naples his prison duels romantic amours prodigality and adventures rendered him quite singular he seemed to be a person of another age it was said of him upon seeing him run against the great condé here go the heroes of history and of romance the queenmother the reigning queen and the queen of england dowager of charles i then forgetting her misfortunes sat under a canopy to view this spectacle the count de sault son of the duke de lesdiguières won the prize and received it from the hands of the queenmother those feasts revived more than ever the taste for devices and emblems which tournaments had formerly brought into vogue and which continued after these were no more an antiquary called douvrier invented in      for louis xiv the emblem of the sun darting its     rays upon a globe with these words nec pluribus impar—yet a match for many the thought was a kind of imitation of a spanish device made by philip ii and was more applicable to this king who possessed the finest part of the new world and so many states in the old than to a young king of france who hitherto gave no more than hopes this device had prodigious success the kings cabinets the movables of the crown the tapestries and sculptures were all adorned with it yet the king never carried it in his tournaments louis xiv has been unjustly condemned for the pride of this device as if he had chosen it himself and perhaps it has been more justly censured for its foundation the body does not represent that which the legend signifies and this legend has not a quite clear and determined sense that which may be explained several ways does not deserve to be explained by any devices those remains of the ancient chivalry may suit with feasts and give some pleasure when these allusions are just new and pointed it is better to have none than suffer such as are bad and low like that of louis xii which was a hedgehog with these words qui sy frotte sy pique—he that touches me galls himself devices are with regard to inscriptions what masquerades are to more solemn ceremonies the feast of versailles in      surpassed that of the carrousel for its singularity magnificence and the pleasures of the mind which mixing with the     splendor of these diversions added a relish and such charms as no feast had ever yet been embellished with versailles began to be a delightful residence without approaching to the grandeur at which it arrived afterward on may   the king came hither with a court consisting of six hundred persons who with their attendants were entertained at his expense as were likewise all those employed in preparing these enchanting scenes there was nothing ever wanting at these feasts but such monuments erected for giving of them as were constructed by the greeks and romans but the readiness with which they built the theatres amphitheatres and porticoes beautified with as much magnificence as taste was a wonder which added to the illusion and which diversified afterward in a thousand ways still augmented the charms of these spectacles there was at first a sort of tournament those who were to run appeared the first day as in a review they were preceded by heralds at arms pages and squires who carried the devices and bucklers and upon the bucklers were written in letters of gold verses composed by perrin and benserade this last especially had a singular talent for these gallant pieces in which he always made delicate and lively allusions to the characters of the persons present to the personages of antiquity or mythology which they represented and to the passions actuating the court at that time the king personated roger     when all the diamonds belonging to the crown sparkled upon his clothes and the horse which he rode the queens and three hundred ladies under triumphal arches viewed this entry the king amidst all the eyes which were fixed upon him distinguished only those of mademoiselle de la vallière the feast was for her alone which she secretly enjoyed though not distinguished from the crowd the cavalcade was followed by a gilt car eighteen feet high fifteen broad and twentyfour long representing the chariot of the sun the four ages of gold silver brass and iron the celestial signs the seasons and the hours followed this car on foot all was distinctly characterized shepherds carried pieces of the enclosure that were adjusted by the sound of trumpets to which succeeded at intervals violins and other instruments some persons who followed apollos car came at first to recite to the queens certain verses suitable to the place the time and the persons present after the races were finished and the night came on four thousand large flambeaux lighted the spot where the feast was given the tables therein were served by two hundred persons who represented the seasons the fauns sylvans and dryads with shepherds grapegatherers and reapers pan and diana advanced upon a moving mountain and descended from it in order to place upon the tables whatever the country and the forests produced that was most delicious behind     the tables in a semicircle rose up all at once a theatre filled with performers in concert the arcades which surrounded the table and theatre were decorated with five hundred chandeliers with tapers in them and a gilt balustrade inclosed this vast circuit these feasts so much superior to what are invented in romances lasted for seven days the king carried four times the prizes of the games and afterward he left those he had won to be contended for by other knights and accordingly gave them up to the victors the comedy of the princesse délide or princess of elis though not one of the best plays of molière was one of the most agreeable decorations of these games for the vast number of fine allegories on the manners of the times and for the apposite purposes which form the agreeableness of these feasts but which are lost to posterity people at court were still fond even to madness of judicial astrology many princes imagined through a haughty superstition that nature distinguished them by writing their destiny in the stars victor amadeus duke of savoy father of the duchess of burgundy retained an astrologer near his person even after his abdication molière was so bold as to attack this delusion in his comedy here also was to be seen a court fool these wretched fellows were still much in vogue this was a relic of barbarism that continued longer in     germany than in any other place the want of amusements and the inability of procuring such as are agreeable and virtuous in times of ignorance and bad taste had given occasion to the invention of this wretched pleasure which degrades the human mind the fool who was then in the court of louis xiv had formerly belonged to the prince of condé his name was angeli the count de gramont said that of all the fools who followed that prince there was none but angeli who made his fortune this buffoon was not without some sense it is he who said that he went not to hear sermons because as he did not like brawling so he did not understand reasoning the farce of the forced marriage was likewise acted at this feast but what was truly admirable here was the first representation of the first three acts of tartuffe the king had an inclination to see this masterpiece even before it was finished he afterward protected it against those false bigots who would have drawn in earth and heaven to be interested for the suppression of it and it will subsist as has been already said elsewhere as long as there shall be any taste and hypocrites remaining in france most of these shining solemnities are often calculated only to please the eyes and the ears that which is no more than pomp and magnificence passes away in one day but when masterpieces of art like     tartuffe make up the ornament of these feasts they leave behind them an eternal remembrance there are still fresh in memory several strokes of those allegories of benserade which were an ornament to the ballads of that time i shall only give here the verses for the king representing the sun   je doute quon le prenne avec vous sur le ton   de daphné ni de phaeton   lui trop ambitieux elle trop inhumaine   il nest point là de piège où vous puissiez donner   le moyen de simaginer   quune femme vous fuie et quun homme vous mène   with you i doubt we must not prate   of daphnes scorn and phaetons fate   he too aspiring she inhuman   in snares like these you cannot fall   for who will dream that eer you shall   be fooled by man or shunned by woman the principal glory of these amusements which perfected taste politeness and talents in france proceeded from this that they did not divert the monarch in the least from his assiduous labors for without these he would only have known how to keep a court and would have been unacquainted with the methods of governing so that had the magnificent pleasures of this court glossed over the miseries of the people they had only been odious but he who gave these feasts gave bread to the people in the famine of      he caused corn to be brought which the rich purchased at a cheap rate and he gave it gratuitously to poor families at the   0 gates of the louvre he remitted to the people three millions of imposts no part of the interior administration was neglected his government was respected abroad the king of spain was obliged to yield to him the precedency the pope was forced to make reparation dunkirk was added to france by a sale no less glorious to the purchaser than it was ignominious to the seller in short all the steps taken while he held the reins of government had been either noble or useful after this the giving of feasts was extremely proper chigi the legate a latere and nephew of pope alexander vii coming in the midst of these rejoicings to versailles to make amends to the king for the high insult offered by the popes guards presented a new spectacle to the court such grand ceremonies are like feasts for the public the honors paid him rendered the satisfaction more striking and illustrious he received under a canopy the compliments of the superior courts the bodies of the city and clergy he entered paris amid the discharge of cannon with the great condé on his right hand and the son of that prince on his left he came in this pomp to humble himself rome and the pope before the king who had not yet drawn his sword after he had audience he dined with the king and all endeavored to treat him magnificently and to give him pleasure afterward the doge of genoa was treated with less ceremony but with the same earnest     desire of pleasing which the king always made reconcilable with his more lofty proceedings all this gave the court of louis xiv an air of grandeur which quite obscured all the other courts of europe he was desirous that this lustre annexed to his person should reflect a glory on all around him that the great should be honored beginning with his brother and the prince and that none should be powerful it was with this view that he determined in favor of the peers their ancient dispute with the presidents of the parliament the latter pretended that they should give their opinions before the peers and accordingly they put themselves in possession of this right but he decided in an extraordinary council that the peers should give their opinions at the bars of justice held in the kings presence before the presidents as if they owed this prerogative only to his person when present and he allowed the ancient usage in those assemblies which are not judicial still to continue in order to distinguish his principal courtiers he invented blue short coats embroidered with gold and silver the permission of wearing these was a great favor to such as were guided by vanity they were in almost as much demand as the collar of an order it may be observed as we have entered upon minute details that at that time these coats were worn over a doublet adorned with ribbons and over the coat passed a belt to which hung the sword there was also a sort of laced cravat and a hat     adorned with a double row of feathers this style which lasted till      became that of all europe except spain and poland for people almost everywhere already piqued themselves on imitating the court of louis xiv he established an order in his household which still continues regulated the several ranks and offices belonging thereto and he created new places about his own person as that of the grand master of the wardrobe he reestablished the tables instituted by francis i and augmented them there were twelve of these for the commensal officers as they are called who eat at court and are served with as much elegance and profusion as a great many sovereigns he would have all strangers invited thither and this lasted during all his reign but there was another point of a still more desirable and polite nature which was that after he had built the pavilions of marly in      all the ladies found in their apartments a complete toilette in which nothing that belonged to luxury was overlooked whoever happened to be on a journey might give repasts in their apartments to their friends and the same delicacy was used in serving the guests as for the master himself such trivial matters have their value only when they are supported by greater in all his actions splendor and generosity were to be seen he made presents of two hundred thousand francs to the daughters of his ministers at their marriage     that which roused most admiration of him in europe was an unexampled instance of liberality he had the hint from a discourse which he held with the duke of saintaignan who told him that cardinal richelieu had sent presents to some learned men of other countries who had written eulogies upon him the king did not wait till he was praised but sure of deserving it he recommended his ministers lionne and colbert to select a number of frenchmen and foreigners distinguished for their literature on whom he might bestow marks of his generosity lionne having written to foreign countries informed himself as much as possible in a matter of such delicacy where the point was to give preference to contemporaries at first a list of sixty persons was made out some had presents given them and others pensions according to their rank wants and merits allati librarian of the vatican count graziani secretary of state to the duke of modena the celebrated viviani mathematician to the grand duke of florence vossius historiographer to the united provinces the illustrious mathematician huygens and a dutch resident in sweden in short down to the professors of altorf and helmstadt towns almost unknown to the french were astonished upon receiving letters from colbert by which he acquainted them that though the king was not their sovereign he entreated them to allow him to be their benefactor the expressions in these letters were estimated from the     dignity of the persons who sent them and all were accompanied with rewards or pensions among the french they knew how to distinguish racine quinault fléchier since bishop of nîmes who was then but very young they had presents it is true that chapelain and cotin had pensions bestowed upon them but it was chiefly chapelain whom the minister colbert had consulted these two men otherwise so much disparaged on account of their poetry were not without merit chapelain was possessed of an immense stock of learning and what is surprising is that he had taste and was one of the most acute critics there is a great difference in all this from genius science and vivacity conduct an artist but they do not form him in any kind none in france had more reputation in their time than ronsard and chapelain the reason for this was that in ronsards days barbarism prevailed and in those of chapelain the people had hardly emerged from it costar a fellow student of balzac and voiture called chapelain the first of the heroic poets boileau had no share in these bounties he had hitherto produced only satires and it is well known that these pieces attacked the learned men whom the ministry had consulted the king distinguished him some years after without consulting anybody the presents made in foreign countries were so considerable that viviani built a house at florence out of the liberality of louis xiv he put in letters of gold upon the frontispiece ædes a deo     datæ—this house is the gift of god being an allusion to the surname of dieu donné which appellation the public voice had given to this prince at his birth the effect which this extraordinary munificence had in europe may be easily imagined and if we consider all the memorable things which the king did very soon after the most severe and most morose men should bear with the excessive eulogiums lavished upon him twelve panegyrics of louis xiv were pronounced in different towns in italy a homage which was paid him neither from fear nor hope and these the marquis zampieri sent to the king he always continued pouring his favors upon the sciences and arts of these we have plain proofs from particular gratuities as about four thousand louis dor to racine also from the fortunes of despréaux and quinault especially that of lulli and of all the artists who devoted their labors to him he even gave a thousand louis dor to benserade for engraving the mezzotinto plates of his ovids metamorphoses in roundelays a liberality badly applied and which only shows the generosity of the sovereign he also recompensed benserade for the little merit which he had shown in his ballads several writers have attributed solely to m colbert this protection given to the arts and this magnificence of louis xiv but he had not further merit in the affair than seconding the magnanimity and     taste of his master this minister who had a very great genius for the finances commerce navigation and the general police had not in his own mind that taste and elevation which the king had he zealously promoted but was far from inspiring him with what nature had given it is not easy to discover upon what foundation certain authors have reproached this monarch with avarice a prince who has domains entirely independent of the revenues of the state may be avaricious like an individual but a king of france who in reality only distributes the treasures of his subjects must of consequence be free from this vice the will or care to recompense may indeed be wanting but this is what louis xiv can never be justly reproached with at the time that he began to lavish so many favors on men of talents the use which the count de bussi made of those he possessed was punished with the utmost severity he was imprisoned in the bastille in the year      his writing the amours of gaul was the pretext for his confinement the real cause was a song in which the king was a little too freely treated the memory of it was revived at this time in order to ruin bussi the supposed author   que deodatus est heureux   de baiser ce bec amoureux   qui dune oreille à lautre va         beyond expression sure that bliss is   when deodatus fondly kisses   that beak so delicate and dear   replete with charms from ear to ear his works were not good enough to compensate for the mischief which they brought upon him he spoke his own language with the utmost purity he was not destitute of merit but his selfsufficiency was much greater than his merit and he made no other use of it but to create himself enemies it would have been generous in louis xiv to have pardoned him but thus he avenged his personal injury while he in appearance yielded to the public clamor the count de bussi was released in about eighteen months but he never recovered his former place in the kings favor though he continued during the remainder of his life to profess an attachment to louis xiv which neither the king nor anybody else believed to be sincere notes to chapter xxiii the king and the cardinal—this anecdote is attested by the memoirs of la porte p     and we there see that the king had taken an aversion to the cardinal that the minister though his relative and intrusted with his education had made no effort to improve him and had often left him without the common necessaries of life he adds much heavier accusations which reflect dishonor on the cardinals reputation but they do not appear to be proved and no accusation should be recognized without proof the king and the assembly—these words faithfully copied are in all the authentic journals of those times     it is neither allowable to omit or change a word in them in any history of france the author of m de m makes a bold conjecture in his note his speech was not quite so good but his eyes spoke more sensibly than his mouth st évremond—this was the celebrated charles de st denis lord of st évremond who had distinguished himself by his gallantry in the field and his wit in conversation his letter reflecting on the memory of cardinal mazarin being discovered louis ordered him to be imprisoned in the bastille but before he could be arrested he made his escape into holland and was invited to england by king charles ii who gratified him with a pension of three hundred pounds he lived to enjoy the favor of king william also and died at london in   0  at the age of ninety his writings have been admired for the vivacity of his style the strength and delicacy of his portraits the justness of his reflections the elegance of his taste and the agreeable variety of his expression they are not however without affectation obscurity and false fire and his poetry is but indifferent henry duke of guise—this henry duke of guise was designed for the church provided with a great number of abbeys and even nominated to the archbishopric of rheims but he was stripped of all his benefices by cardinal richelieu he fought a duel with count de coligny for which he was obliged to retire to rome whence he repaired to naples in order to command the army of the people who had rebelled against the court of spain his adventures on this occasion were altogether romantic but in spite of all his courage and efforts he was taken prisoner and carried to spain being eventually released at the solicitation of the great prince of condé perrin and benserade—abbé perrin was a native of lyons the first who by royal patent established an opera in paris in imitation of the venetian opera he and his partners erected a theatre in the rue mazarine and in      exhibited the pastoral pomona the poetry by perrin and the music by lambert perrin quarreling with his partners resigned his patent in favor of the famous lulli     who built a new theatre near the palace of the luxembourg from which he later transferred his company to the hall of the palais royal perrin besides several pastorals of five acts wrote many sonnets odes and elegies he also translated the æneid of virgil in verse and enjoyed a great reputation his death happened about the year    0 isaac benserade was born of a good family at lyons in normandy in      he soon distinguished himself as a wit a poet and a man of gallantry was gratified with a pension by the queen mother of louis xiv and lived in great familiarity and favor with the noblemen of that court he composed tragedies comedies and verses for ballets which were in great esteem at court as well as through all france in the younger days of louis all the wits of that kingdom were divided on the merit of two sonnets one by benserade and the other by voiture he was particularly patronized by cardinal mazarin and preserved his reputation to a good old age among his bons mots the most remarkable is the repartee he made to a gentleman whom he had often rallied on suspicion of impotence that gentleman meeting benserade on the street well said he notwithstanding all your raillery my wife has been delivered some days o sir replied the poet i never doubted the ability of your wife la vallière—louisa frances de la baumeleblanc de la vallière was maid of honor to henrietta of england duchess of orleans she fell in love with the person of louis xiv who returned her passion had several children by her and raised her to the rank of duchess of vaujour and peeress of france tired of the pleasures of a court and touched by the stings of repentance she retired to the convent of the carmelites in paris and spent the latter part of her life in acts of piety and mortification alazzi—leo alazzi was a native of chio acquired a great share of reputation for learning and wrote a great number of books but his taste and judgment were not thought equal to his erudition he died at rome in      in the eightythird year of his age   0 graziani—jerome graziani count of sarzana distinguished himself by his poetical genius he wrote a heroic poem entitled cleopatra and another on the conquests of granada together with a collection of odes and sonnets he was appointed secretary of state and afterward created count of sarzana by francis duke of modena to whose family he had been always zealously attached viviani—vincent viviani was a disciple of the famous galileo and soon distinguished himself by a sublime genius for geometry he undertook to restore by conjecture the fifth book of apollonius de maximis et de minimis which was lost while he was engaged in this undertaking the famous borelli found in the grand dukes library at florence an arabic manuscript with this latin title apollonii pergæi conicorum libri octo this with the grand dukes permission he carried to rome to be translated by abraham ecchellensis maronite professor of the oriental tongues viviani in the meantime without the least communication with this translator published his restoration by conjecture and when the translation of the arabic manuscript was finished it appeared that he had not only restored all that was in the fifth book of apollonius but carried his researches much farther on the same subject he afterward restored by the same art of divination or conjecture three books of the ancient geometrician aristæus which had been lost vossius—dionysius vossius who translated into latin reidaniuss annals and was nominated professor of history and eloquence at derpt in livonia died young at amsterdam in      isaac vossius the son of gerard john vossius was also a man of great erudition and received a very considerable present from louis xiv but he was no historian he came over to england in the reign of charles ii and died canon of windsor matthew vossius the brother of dionysius wrote in latin five books of the annals of holland and zealand but it does not appear that he received either pension or present from the     king of france whereas the letter of colbert to isaac vossius is still extant racine—john racine celebrated for his tragedies which are preferred to those of the great corneille in point of correctness tenderness and regularity corneille was more sublime racine more interesting the one commanded admiration the other maintained an empire over all the passions of the heart corneille was living and admired by all france when racine made his first appearance as a tragic writer and acquired the applause of the whole kingdom without diminishing the fame of his great contemporary quinault—philip quinault acquired great reputation by his comedies and operas notwithstanding the satirical couplet of boileau   si je pense exprimer un auteur sans desaut   la raison dit virgile et la rime quinault to the censure of this poet quinault made no reply on the contrary he courted his friendship and visited him often in order to take his advice concerning his works but he never spoke a syllable of boileaus own performances and this affected silence piqued him extremely his only reason said despréaux for soliciting my acquaintance was that he might have an opportunity to talk of his own verses but he never says a word of mine fléchier—esprit fléchier bishop of nimes rendered himself famous by writing panegyrics on the saints and by composing funeral orations one of the most celebrated of which is that which he pronounced on the great turenne he was a prelate of uncommon erudition pious moderate and extremely charitable chapelain—john chapelain was in very high reputation for his poetical genius under the ministry of the cardinals richelieu and mazarin balzac has praised him on many occasions he wrote one ode to cardinal richelieu which is generally admired but his poem de la pucelle was the ruin of all his poetical fame and produced the following severe distich       illa capellani dudum expectata puella   post tata in lucem tempora prodit anus chapelain in the midst of his success as an author had the misfortune to fall under the ridicule of boileau as did his contemporary cotin canon of bayeux who though a good scholar was a wretched preacher and a miserable poet guez—john louis guez lord of balzac was patronized as a man of genius by richelieu esteemed the most eloquent man in france and the great restorer of the french language voiture—vincent voiture was patronized by the duke of orleans brother of louis xiv he distinguished himself by his writings both in prose and verse which were much admired for their purity of style gayety gallantry and elegant turn of thought he was the son of a vintner of amiens of an amorous disposition and much addicted to play boileau—nicholas boileau sieur despréaux is so well known by his poetical works as to need no further description lulli—john baptist lulli was a native of florence though he is styled the father of french music he it was who introduced operas into france and his compositions were universally admired st évremond says he was a perfect master of the passions and understood the human heart much better than the authors whose works he set to music chapter xxiv anecdotes continued louis xiv was desirous of joining the sweets of friendship to the glory the pleasures the pomp and the gallantry which brightened the first years of his reign but to make a happy choice of friends is     a difficult task for a monarch one of those in whom he placed the greatest confidence basely betrayed him the other made an ill use of his favor the first was the marquis de vardes who was privy to the kings affection for madame de la vallière it is generally known that court intrigues induced him to seek her ruin her situation exposed her to the illwill of the jealous but her character should have secured her from the machinations of enemies it is known also that he had the boldness in concert with the count de guiche and the countess of soissons to write a counterfeit letter to the queen in the name of the king of spain her father this letter informed the queen of what should have been concealed from her and what could not but disturb the peace of the royal family besides being guilty of this piece of treachery he was malicious enough to spread a report that the duke and duchess of navailles the worthiest persons at court were at the bottom of it these though entirely innocent were sacrificed to the resentment of the deceived monarch the villainous proceeding of de vardes was detected but too late criminal as he was however his punishment did not exceed that of the innocent persons whom he had accused and who were deprived of their places and obliged to retire from court the other favorite was the count of lauzun afterward created duke sometimes the kings rival in his occasional amours sometimes his confidant and so well known since by the marriage which he contracted     in too public a manner with the kings niece and which he afterward renewed in secret notwithstanding the promise he had given to his master the king disappointed in his choice of favorites declared that where he had sought for friends he had found only intriguers this unhappy knowledge of mankind which is generally acquired too late caused him likewise to say whenever i give a vacant place i make a hundred malcontents and one ungrateful wretch neither the pleasures nor embellishments of the kings palaces and of paris nor the care of the police were in the least discontinued during the war of      the king danced at the balls till the year    0 he was then thirtytwo years of age upon seeing the tragedy of britannicus played at st germain he was struck with the following verses   pour mérite premier pour vertu singulière   il excelle à traîner un char dans la carrière   á disputer des prix indignes de ses mains   á se donner luimême en spectacle aux romains   his chief desert in trifling feats to place   to drive the chariot foremost in the race   in low pursuits to win the ignoble prize   himself exposed a show to vulgar eyes from that time he ceased to dance in public and the poet reformed the monarch his connection with the duchess de la vallière still subsisted notwithstanding the frequent breaches of his fidelity to her these were not attended with much difficulty he found every woman disposed to receive     his addresses with transport and he constantly returned to her who by the mildness and goodness of her character and even by the force of habit had captivated his affections without art but in the year      she perceived that madame de montespan was gaining the ascendent she bore this with her usual mildness she supported the mortification of being a long time witness to the triumph of her rival she scarcely uttered a complaint but thought herself happy in her misfortune because she was respectfully treated by the king whom she continued to love and had opportunities of seeing him though she was not now the object of his affections at length in the year      she had recourse to the refuge of a mind replete with tenderness and sensibility which can only be subdued by the most profound and affecting considerations she thought that god alone was worthy to possess a heart which had been honored with the affection of such a lover and her conversion in a short time made as much noise as her passion had done formerly she became a carmelite at paris and persevered in the austerities of that order the delicacy of a woman accustomed to so much pomp luxury and pleasure was not shocked when she was obliged to cover herself with a haircloth walk barefooted fast rigidly and sing among the choir at night in a language she did not understand in this manner she lived from      till    0 by the name of sister louisa the penitent a king would deserve the name of tyrant should he     punish a guilty woman with so much severity yet many a woman has punished herself thus for having loved there are scarcely any examples of statesmen who have buried themselves in this manner yet the guilt of politicians seems to stand more in need of expiation than the frailty of lovers but those who govern souls have authority only with the weak it is generally known that when sister louisa was informed of the death of the duke of vermandois her son by the king she said i should lament his birth more grievously than his death she had a daughter who of all the kings children had the nearest resemblance to her father and afterward married prince armand of conti cousin of the great condé in the meantime madame de montespan enjoyed the monarchs favor and availed herself of it with an external pomp and pride equal to the modesty of madame de la vallière while madame de la vallière and madame de montespan continued to vie with each other for the first place in the kings affection the whole court was taken up with love intrigues louvois himself became sensible to the influence of this passion among the many mistresses of this minister whose rough character seemed so incompatible with love was madame du frenoi wife of one of his clerks in whose favor he by his credit afterward caused a new place to be established among the queens     attendants she was created lady of the bedchamber she had access to the queens person on all occasions the king by thus indulging the private inclinations of his ministers thought to justify his own there cannot be a more striking example of the power of prepossession and custom than married women being at that time allowed publicly to have gallants while the granddaughter of henry iv was refused even a husband she after having rejected so many sovereigns and having entertained hopes of marrying louis xiv was at the age of fortythree desirous to make the fortune of a gentleman of a noble race she obtained leave to marry péquilin of the caumont family count of lauzun and a captain of one of the two companies called the hundred gentlemen pensioners which are now extinct and for which the king had instituted the place of colonelgeneral of the dragoons there were numerous precedents of princesses who had married gentlemen the roman emperors often gave their daughters in marriage to senators the daughters of the sovereigns of asia more powerful and more despotic than a king of france always marry the slaves of their fathers mademoiselle bestowed upon the count of lauzun all her possessions valued at twenty millions four duchies the sovereignty of dombes the county of eu and the palace of orleans called luxembourg she retained nothing having given herself up     entirely to the pleasing idea of making the person she loved richer than any king ever made a subject the contract was drawn up lauzun was for a day duke of montpensier nothing now remained but to sign in a word all things were in readiness when the king attacked on every side by representations of princes ministers and the enemies of a man whose prosperity was too great to be borne retracted his promise and forbade the alliance he had by letter apprised foreign courts of the intended marriage he wrote again to inform them that it was dropped he was censured for having permitted it he was equally censured for having forbidden it he was afflicted at being the cause of mademoiselles unhappiness however this very prince who had been grieved at being under the necessity of breaking his word with lauzun caused him in november    0 to be confined in the castle of pignerol for having privately married the princess who he had a few months before given him leave to marry publicly he was shut up during the space of ten years there are many kingdoms whose sovereigns have not so much power those that have are most beloved when they decline to make use of it should a citizen who does not violate the laws of the state be so severely punished by him who represents the state is there not a wide difference between offending ones sovereign and betraying ones sovereign should a king treat a man with more rigor than the     law would treat him those who have asserted that madame de montespan who put a stop to this marriage being irritated against the count de lauzun for the bitter reproaches he uttered against her exacted that vengeance have done that monarch great injustice it would have been a proof both of tyranny and pusillanimity to sacrifice to female resentment a brave man and a favorite who after being deprived of an immense fortune by his master had been guilty of no other crime but speaking too freely of madame de montespan i hope my readers will excuse these reflections which the natural rights of mankind oblige me to make but at the same time equity requires that as louis xiv had not been guilty of an action of that nature during the whole course of his reign he should not be accused of so cruel a piece of injustice he was certainly severe enough in punishing with such rigor a clandestine marriage an innocent union which it would have been more prudent in him to pass over in silence to withdraw his favor from lauzun was but just to imprison him was too severe those who call this private marriage in question need only read the memoirs of mademoiselle with attention these memoirs reveal what she endeavors to conceal it appears from them that this princess who had complained so bitterly to the king when her marriage was forbidden did not dare to complain of her husbands being imprisoned she owns   0 that she was thought to be married she does not however assert that she was not and if there was no proof of it but that expression i neither can nor ought to change my sentiments for him it would be conclusive lauzun and fouquet were astonished at meeting in the same prison but the latter who in the height of his glory and power had seen péquilin mixed with the crowd like a gentleman of no fortune from one of the provinces thought him out of his senses when he assured him that he had been the kings favorite and had obtained leave to marry the granddaughter of henry iv with all the wealth and the titles of the house of montpensier after having languished ten years in prison he was at length released but it was not till after madame de montespan had engaged mademoiselle to confer the sovereignty of dombes and the county of eu upon the duke of maine then an infant who possessed them after the death of that princess she made this donation merely through a hope that the duke of lauzun would be acknowledged as her husband but she was herein deceived the king only allowed her to bestow on her concealed and unfortunate husband the lands of st fargeau and thiers with other considerable revenues which lauzun found insufficient in a word she was obliged to be satisfied with being his wife in private and to suffer herself to be neglected by him in public this princess unhappy at court and unhappy at     home which is the ordinary effect of violent passions died in      as for the count of lauzun he went over to england in      being fated to extraordinary adventures he conducted to france the queen of james ii and her son then in the cradle he was created duke he commanded in ireland with but indifferent success and returned more celebrated for his adventures than esteemed for his personal merit we have seen him die at a very advanced age quite forgotten as is generally the case with those who have been concerned in important events without having performed great exploits madame de montespan however was allpowerful at court at the beginning of the intrigues just spoken of athénaïs de mortemart wife of the marquis de montespan her elder sister the marchioness de thiange and her younger sister for whom she obtained the abbey of fontevraud were the finest women of that age and all three added the most refined and lively wit to their personal attractions their brother the duke of vivonne marshal of france was one of the most eminent men at court both for taste and learning the king happening one day to ask him what advantage is there in reading the duke who was fat and of a ruddy complexion answered reading has the same effect upon the mind that partridges have upon my cheeks     these four were universally admired for a happy turn of conversation which united humor simplicity and refinement and went by the appellation of the mortemart wit they wrote with inexpressible ease and grace this sufficiently shows the absurdity of a story which i have heard repeated over and over that madame de montespan was obliged to employ madame scarron to write her letters and that she thereby became her rival and afterward supplanted her it is true indeed that madame scarron since madame de maintenon had more acquired knowledge and her conversation was more agreeably insinuating there are letters of hers extant wherein art embellishes nature and which are written with the utmost elegance but madame de montespan had no occasion for the assistance of anothers wit and she was long possessed of the kings favor before madame de maintenon was presented to him madame de montespans glory was in its brightest lustre at the time of the kings journey into flanders in    0 the ruin of the dutch was planned during this journey in the midst of pleasures it was a continual festival attended with the utmost pomp and magnificence the king who generally went upon an expedition on horseback upon this occasion went in a coach postchaises were not invented till afterwards the queen her sisterinlaw and the marchioness de montespan were in this magnificent equipage which     was followed by many others and when madame de montespan went alone she had four of the kings guards to attend her then the dauphin came with his retinue and mademoiselle with hers this was before the fatal affair of her marriage she in perfect peace of mind partook of all these triumphs and saw with secret satisfaction her lover who was the kings favorite at the head of his company of guards the finest movables of the crown were carried into the towns where the king passed the night in every city the court passed through there was either a ball or fireworks the king was accompanied by all the troops of his household and all his domestics went before or followed a public table was kept at st germain in this pomp the court visited all the conquered towns the chief ladies of brussels and ghent came to see this magnificent procession the king invited them to his table and with great generosity made them presents all the officers of the troops in garrison received gratuities there was frequently no less than fifteen hundred louis dor a day spent in liberalities all the honors and distinctions were intended for madame de montespan except what duty exacted for the queen yet that lady was not in the secret of the expedition the king knew how to make a distinction between pleasure and state affairs the kings sister who was alone intrusted with the care of uniting two kings and bringing about the destruction of holland embarked at dunkirk aboard     the fleet of her brother charles ii king of england she carried with her mademoiselle kerowal afterward duchess of portsmouth whose beauty was equal to that of madame de montespan she afterward became in england what madame de montespan was in france but with greater credit king charles was governed by her to the last moment of his life and though he was by no means constant to her she always preserved her ascendency over him no womans beauty was ever more lasting than hers when near the age of seventy she had something noble and pleasing in her countenance which years could not efface the kings sister went to see her brother at canterbury and returned with the glory of being successful she had not long enjoyed it when a sudden and painful death carried her off at the age of twentysix on june  0    0 the court was seized with grief and consternation aggravated by the manner of her death the princess thought she had been poisoned montague the english ambassador was convinced of it the court scarcely doubted it and it was the received opinion all over europe one of her husbands old domestics told me the name of the person who as he thought gave the poison this man said he whose circumstances were but narrow immediately afterward retired into normandy where he purchased an estate upon which he lived a long time in opulence the poison was a diamond reduced to powder and strewed over strawberries     instead of sugar the court and city were of opinion that the princess was poisoned with a glass of succory water after which she felt insupportable pangs and in a short time died in convulsions but the malice of mankind and a love for the marvellous were the sole causes of this general persuasion there could have been no poison in the glass of water since madame de la fayette and another drank the remainder of it without being in the least affected the powder of diamond is no more poisonous than the powder of coral the princess had been a long time troubled with an abscess formed in her liver she was in a very bad state of health and had even been brought to bed of a child entirely putrefied her husband who has been much suspected all over europe was never accused of any crime either before or after this event and there are but few instances of criminals who have been guilty of only one inhuman action the human species would be indeed unhappy if atrocious deeds were as often committed as believed it was said that the chevalier of lorraine a favorite of the duke of orleans had recourse to this horrible vengeance on account of his being banished and imprisoned for his ill behavior to the princess people do not reflect that the chevalier of lorraine was then at rome and that it is difficult for a knight of malta of twenty years of age to occasion when at rome the death of a great princess at paris it is but too true that a weakness and indiscretion     of the viscount de turenne was what first gave rise to these invidious reports which men take a pleasure in reviving at the age of sixty he was the lover and the dupe of madame coatquen as he had been before of madame de longueville he disclosed to that lady the secret of state which was concealed from the kings brother madame de coatquen who loved the chevalier of lorraine divulged it to her gallant who informed the duke of orleans of it the family of this prince was deluged with the bitterest reproaches and the most tormenting jealousies these vexations began before the princess voyage to england the evil was aggravated by her return the dukes sallies of passion and the frequent contentions of his favorites with the friends of the duchess filled the house with trouble and confusion the duchess a few days before her death tenderly complained to the marchioness of coatquen of the misfortunes which she had occasioned that lady kneeled down by her bedside and bathing her hands with tears answered only by these verses from the tragedy of wenceslaus jallois—jétais—lamour a sur moi tant dempire je mégare madame  ne puis que vous dire i thought—i was—love reigns with boundless sway— in mazes lost—i know not what to say the chevalier of lorraine who had caused all these dissensions was immediately sent by the king to the prison of pierre encise the count marsan     of the house of lorraine and the marquis afterward marshal of villeroi were banished in a word the natural death of this unhappy princess was looked upon as the consequence of these misunderstandings the public belief that the duchess of orleans had been poisoned was greatly confirmed by this crimes becoming prevalent in france at that juncture amidst all the horrors of a civil war this base method of revenge was never put in practice this crime by an unaccountable fatality infected france at the time of its greatest glory and of pleasures calculated to soften the manners of mankind just as it gained ground in rome during the most shining period of the commonwealth two italians one of whom went by the name of exili labored for a long time in conjunction with an italian apothecary named glaser to discover the philosophers stone having lost the little fortune they had they endeavored to repair their loss by carrying on a criminal commerce they secretly sold poisons confession one of the greatest restraints upon human depravity but which men frequently abuse in the belief that they may commit crimes and afterward expiate them confession i say made it known to the chief penitentiary of paris that some persons had died by poison he gave immediate notice of this to the government the two italians who were suspected were confined in the bastille one of them died there exili continued     in confinement without being convicted and from the midst of a prison he spread over paris those fatal secrets which cost the civil lieutenant daubrai and his family their lives and at last gave occasion to erecting the chamber of poisons commonly called the fiery chamber love was the original source of these shocking adventures the marquis of brivilliers soninlaw of the civil lieutenant daubrai lodged in his house st croix a captain in his regiment who was remarkable for his agreeable person his wife suggested to him the ill consequences that this might produce the husband however was obstinantely bent upon having the young man live in the same house with his wife who was young handsome and very susceptible the event was such as might have been expected they conceived a mutual passion for each other the civil lieutenant father of the marchioness was severe and imprudent enough to cause the captain to be sent to the bastille when it would have been sufficient to send him to his regiment st croix unluckily happened to be confined in the same chamber with exili this italian taught him to wreak his revenge the consequences which are enough to make one shudder with horror are universally known the marchioness did not make any attempt upon the life of her husband who considered with indulgence a passion of which he himself had been the cause but her ardent desire of vengeance impelled     her to poison her father her two brothers and her sister though guilty of such execrable crimes she retained a sense of religion she often went to confession and even when she was apprehended at liège a general confession written with her own hand was found upon her this was not considered as a positive proof of her guilt but only as a presumptive it is not true that she made experiments of the efficacy of her powders in the hospitals according to the popular report which has been adopted by the author of the remarkable trials the work of a lawyer without employment and calculated to amuse the vulgar but it is true that both she and st croix had private dealings with persons since accused of the same crimes she was burned in      her head being first cut off but this crime continued to infect paris from    0 when exili began to compound poisons till    0 it cannot be concealed from the world that pennautier receivergeneral for the clergy and the friend of this woman was accused some time after of having made use of these secrets and that it cost him onehalf of his wealth to stifle the accusation la voisin la vigoueaux a priest named le sage and others dealt in exilis secrets under the pretext of amusing persons of curious and weak minds with the sight of apparitions the crime was imagined to be more general than it really was the fiery chamber was established at the arsenal near the bastille in    0 persons of the first quality were   0 cited before it among others two nieces of cardinal mazarin the duchess of bouillon and the countess of soissons mother of prince eugene they were not ordered into custody as we are told in the history of reboulet he is not less mistaken when he asserts that the duchess appeared before her judges with so many friends that she would have been in no danger even if she had been guilty what friends could at that time have screened anybody from justice the duchess of bouillon was accused of nothing but indulging an absurd curiosity the countess of soissons who retired to brussels was charged with something of a more serious nature the marshal of luxembourg was confined in the bastille and underwent a long examination after which he remained fourteen months longer in prison it is easy to conjecture the shocking reports which these accusations gave rise to in paris at length upon la voisin and her accomplices being burned alive these crimes and inquiries discontinued this abomination however was peculiar to some individuals and did not corrupt the refined manners of the nation but it left in the minds of men an unhappy propensity to suspect natural death of being occasioned by violent means the same opinion which had been formed concerning the unhappy fate of henrietta of england duchess of orleans was afterward revived with respect to her daughter mary louisa who was married     in      to charles ii king of spain that young princess set out for madrid with regret mademoiselle had often said to the duke of orleans brother to the king do not carry your daughter so often to court she will be too unhappy elsewhere this young princess was desirous of marrying the dauphin i make you queen of spain said the king what more could i do for my daughter ah returned she you might do much more for your niece she died in the year      at the same age as her mother it was regarded as an incontestable truth that the austrian council of charles ii was desirous of removing her out of the way because she loved her country and might prevent the king her husband from declaring for the allies against france an antidote was sent her from versailles but these remedies are very precarious since what may cure one disorder occasioned by poison may increase another and there is no universal antidote the pretended counterpoison arrived after her death those who have read the memoirs compiled by the marquis de dangeau will find therein that the king said at supper the queen of spain has been poisoned by eating of an eelpie and the countess of pernitz with the two attendants zapata and nina eating it also have lost their lives by the same poison after having read this extraordinary anecdote in these manuscript memoirs which are said to have been carefully written by a courtier who had     scarcely ever quitted louis xiv during the space of forty years i still entertain some doubt i inquired of the kings ancient domestics whether it was true that a king always so reserved in his discourse had expressed himself in so indiscreet a manner they all assured me that nothing could be more false i asked the duchess of st pierre on her return from spain whether the three persons mentioned had died at the same time as the queen she gave me convincing proofs that they had all three survived their mistress in a word i discovered that these memoirs of the marquis de dangeau were nothing more than a collection of news written by one of his footmen and this may be very easily perceived by the style the trifling circumstances and the falsehoods with which it abounds after all these dismal ideas to which the death of henrietta of england has led us we must now return to those events by which her loss was followed at court the princess palatine succeeded her a year after and was mother of the duke of orleans afterward regent of the kingdom she was under the necessity of abjuring calvinism in order to marry the duke of orleans but she always retained a secret veneration for her own religion which is not easily shaken off when it has been impressed upon the mind from infancy the unfortunate adventure of one of the queens maids of honor in      gave rise to a new institution this misfortune is well known by the sonnet of the abortion which has been so frequently cited       toi que lamour fit par un crime   et que lhonneur défait par un crime à son tour   funeste ouvrage de lamour   de lhonneur funeste victime etc   o thou who diest imperfect and unborn   sad compound of creation and decay   embryo unformed denied the light of day   of blank and being the reproach and scorn   produced by guilty loves impetuous tide   by guilty honor in its turn destroyed   the fatal work of love by stealth enjoyed   the hapless victim of stern honors pride   o let me calm the tempest of my breast   for thou in dark oblivions shade at rest   feelest not these horrors of internal strife   in thee two rival powers their empire prove   and love in spite of honor gave thee life   but honor slew thee een in spite of love the dangerous situation of maid of honor in a gay and voluptuous court occasioned twelve ladies of the bedchamber to be substituted in the room of the twelve maids of honor and this regulation has ever since continued in the queens household this institution rendered the court more numerous and magnificent by fixing there the husbands and relatives of these ladies which increased the number of those who attended the court and made it more brilliant the princess of bavaria who had espoused the dauphin added lustre and vivacity to the court the marchioness of montespan always attracted the chief attention but at last she ceased to please and her violent emotions of grief by no means conciliated     the almost alienated affection of the monarch however her connection with the court always continued as she was possessed of a responsible place there being superintendent of the queens household her connection with the king remained likewise on account of the children he had by her the force of habit and the ascendency she had acquired she retained all the outward show of esteem and friendship but that was no consolation to her and the king afflicted at being the occasion of her frequent inquietudes and inspired by another passion already began to find pleasure in conversing with madame de maintenon which he no longer enjoyed with his former mistress he found himself at once divided between madame de montespan whom he could not forsake mademoiselle fontagne whom he loved and madame de maintenon whose conversation was necessary to his distracted mind the rivalry of these three kept the whole court in suspense it reflects great honor on louis xiv that none of these intrigues had any influence on public affairs and that love which disturbed the court never caused the least disturbance in the kingdom there cannot in my opinion be a better proof that the soul of louis was as great as it was tender i should even look upon these court intrigues which have no connection with state affairs as undeserving of a place in this history if the name of     louis xiv did not render everything interesting and if the veil had not been removed from those mysteries by several historians who have for the most part disfigured them notes to chapter xxiv montespan—at the end of the memoirs above mentioned is printed a history of the amours of mademoiselle and m de lauzun it is the work of some valet de chambre verses on a parallel with the history are subjoined and with all the absurdities which the dutch booksellers have long had a sort of a privilege to impose upon the world we should place in the same class most of the stories concerning mademoiselle to be met with in the memoirs of madame de maintenon it is there said that in      one of the ministers of the duke of lorraine came disguised like a beggar and presenting himself before mademoiselle in church showed her a prayerbook upon which was written from the duke of lorraine and that he afterward endeavored to prevail on her to declare the duke her heir vol ii page  0  this fable is copied from the adventure of queen clothilde whether true or false mademoiselle takes no notice of it in her memoirs in which she seldom omits little circumstances the duke of lorraine had no pretensions to the succession of mademoiselle add to this that she had in      appointed the duke of maine and the count of toulouse her heirs the author of these wretched memoirs says on page  0  that the duke of lauzun on his return looked upon mademoiselle in no other light but as a woman inflamed by an impure passion she was his wife and he himself acknowledged it it is hardly possible to write a greater number of falsehoods in a more indecent style     chapter xxv additional memoirs the youth and beauty of mademoiselle de fontagne the birth of a son whom she bore to the king in    0 and the title of duchess with which she was graced all conspired to prevent madame de maintenon from obtaining the first place to which as yet she dared not aspire and which she afterward possessed but the duchess of fontagne and her son died in      the marchioness de montespan having now no declared rival was no longer able to preserve a heart wearied with her and her eternal complainings when men are past the vigor of youth they almost all require the company of an agreeable woman the weight of public affairs especially renders such a relaxation extremely necessary the new favorite madame de maintenon who perceived the secret power she was daily acquiring conducted herself with that artful address which is so natural to the female sex and is by no means displeasing to the male she one day wrote to madame de frontenac her cousin in whom she reposed the most perfect confidence when he leaves me he is always in affliction but never in despair while her interest was thus increasing and that of madame de montespan was drawing toward an end the two rivals saw each other every day sometimes with a secret     uneasiness and sometimes with a transient familiarity which the necessity of conversing together and the fatigue of perpetual constraint obliged them to assume they both agreed to write memoirs of all that passed at court the work was never brought to any degree of perfection madame de montespan was wont in the latter years of her life to divert herself in reading some of these memoirs to her friends that spirit of devotion which mingled itself in all these secret intrigues contributed still more to strengthen the influence of madame de maintenon and to weaken that of madame de montespan the king began to reproach himself for his attachment to a married woman and felt this scruple the more sensibly as he no longer felt the power of love things continued in this state of perplexity until      a year rendered memorable by the revocation of the edict of nantes scenes of a very different nature were then presented to the public view on the one hand the despair and flight of a part of the nation on the other new feasts at versailles trianon and marly built nature forced in all these beautiful spots and gardens formed with all the taste and elegance that art could bestow the marriage of the grandson of the great condé to mademoiselle de nantes the kings daughter by madame de montespan was the last triumph of that mistress who now began to retire from court the king afterward disposed in marriage of two other children whom he had by the same lady     mademoiselle de blois to the duke de chartres whom we have since seen regent of the kingdom and the duke de maine to louisa benedicta de bourbon granddaughter of the great condé and sister of the present duke a princess distinguished by her wit and her taste for the polite arts those who have approached the royal palace or the palace de sceaux know that all the popular reports relating to her marriage and retailed in so many histories are absolutely false and groundless you will find it reported in more than twenty different volumes that the house of orleans and the house of condé rejected the proposals with indignation you will find it written that the princess the duke de chartress mother threatened her son nay that she even beat him the anecdotes of the constitution relates with a very serious air that the king having employed abbé du bois subpreceptor to the duke de chartres to negotiate the match the abbé found great difficulty in succeeding and that he asked the cardinals hat as a reward for his labor whatever relates to the court is written with as little regard to truth in several of our modern histories before the marriage between the duke and mademoiselle de nantes was celebrated the marquis de seignelay gave the king an entertainment worthy of that monarch in the gardens de sceaux laid out by lenôtre with as much taste and elegance as those of versailles and the entertainment was embellished by a representation of lidylle de la     paix composed by racine there was another tournament at versailles and after the marriage the king displayed a scene of uncommon magnificence of which cardinal mazarin had given the first specimen in      there were placed in the hall of marly four shops filled with all the richest and most exquisite curiosities that the industry of the parisian artists could produce these four shops were so many superb decorations representing the four seasons of the year madame de montespan kept one of them with the dauphin her rival kept another with the duke de maine the two newlymarried noblemen had each his shop the duke with madame de thiange and the duchess who on account of her youth could not decently keep a shop with a man was with madame de chevereuse the ladies and gentlemen who were named for this excursion drew by lot the jewels with which these shops were adorned thus the king made presents to all his court in a manner worthy of himself the lottery of cardinal mazarin was neither so ingenious nor so brilliant these lotteries had formerly been used by the roman emperors but none of them ever thought of heightening their magnificence by such an air of gallantry after the marriage of her daughter madame de montespan appeared no more at court she continued to live in paris with great dignity she had a large annuity settled upon her for life the king ordered a pension of a thousand louis dor to be   0 paid her every month she went yearly to drink the waters at bourbon and married the young women in the neighborhood to whom she gave portions she was now past the age when the imagination struck with lively impressions sends people to a nunnery she died at bourbon in   0  about a year after the marriage of mademoiselle de nantes the prince of condé died at fontainebleau in the sixtysixth year of his age his death was occasioned by a disease which was rendered more violent by a journey he took to visit the duchess who was seized with smallpox from this anxious concern for the safety of the duchess which cost him his life one may easily judge whether he had any aversion to the marriage of his grandson with the daughter of the king and madame de montespan as has been reported by all those lying gazettes with which holland was then overrun we even find in a history of the prince of condé produced from the same repositories of ignorance and imposture that the king took pleasure in mortifying that prince on all occasions and that at the marriage of the princess of conti daughter to madame de la vallière the secretary of state refused him the title of high and mighty lord as if that were a title commonly given to the princes of the blood but how could the author who composed the history of louis xiv in avignon partly from these wretched memoirs be so ignorant of the world and of the custom of our court as to relate the like falsehoods     meanwhile after the marriage of the duchess and the total eclipse of the mother madame de maintenon victorious over all opposition gained such an ascendency and inspired louis xiv with so much love and so many scruples of conscience that by the advice of father de la chaise he married her privately in the month of january      in a little chapel which stood at the end of the apartment that was afterward possessed by the duke of burgundy there was no contract nor any articles of marriage harlay de chanvalon archbishop of paris assisted by the confessor gave them the nuptial benediction montchevreuil and bontems first valet de chambre were present as witnesses it is no longer possible to suppress this fact which has been mentioned by so many authors who have been mistaken however with regard to the names the place and the dates louis xiv was then in his fortyeighth year and the lady he married in her fiftysecond this king already covered with glory was desirous of mingling the innocent pleasures of a private life with the cares of state the marriage did not engage him in anything unworthy of his rank and it was always a doubtful point at court whether madame de maintenon was married or not she was respected as the choice of the king but never treated as queen we are apt to consider the fate of this lady as something very surprising though history supplies us with many instances of greater and more distinguished     fortunes which had a meaner and lower origin the marchioness de st sebastian married to victor amadeus king of sardinia was not superior to madame de maintenon catherine empress of russia was greatly inferior and the first wife of james ii king of england was far beneath her according to the prejudices of europe unknown in other parts of the world she was of an ancient family and granddaughter of theodoreagrippa daubigné gentleman of the bedchamber to henry iv her father constant daubigné having formed a design of settling in carolina and having applied to the english for that purpose was thrown into prison in the castle of trompette whence he was delivered by the daughter of the governor whose name was de cardillac a gentleman of bourdelois constant daubigné married his benefactress in      and carried her along with him to carolina but returning to france in a few years after they were both committed to custody at niort in poitou by order of the court it was in this prison of niort that frances daubigné was born in      a woman destined by heaven to suffer all the hardships and to enjoy all the favors of fortune carried to america at three years of age left on the shore by the negligence of a servant where she was on the point of being devoured by a serpent brought back an orphan at ten years of age educated with great severity in the house of madame de neuillant a relative and mother of the     duchess de navailles she was so happy as to marry in      paul scarron who lived near her in hell street scarron was of an ancient family belonging to the parliament and illustrious by its great alliances but the character of a wit and of burlesque writer which he bore lessened his dignity although it made him more generally beloved it was however a very lucky incident for mademoiselle daubigné to get this man for a husband deformed and impotent as he was and possessed of but a small fortune before her marriage she abjured the calvinistic religion which was her own as well as that of her ancestors her beauty and her wit were such that she soon began to be distinguished her acquaintance was eagerly courted by the best company in paris and this part of her youth was doubtless the happiest time of her life after her husbands death in    0 she solicited the king for a small pension of fifteen hundred livres which scarron had enjoyed at last after some years had elapsed the king gave her a pension of two thousand addressing her at the same time in the following strain madame i have made you wait long but you have so many friends that i was determined to have all the merit of this action to myself this anecdote i had from cardinal de fleury who took pleasure in frequently repeating it because he said that louis xiv paid him the same compliment when he gave him the bishopric of fréjus     and yet it appears from the letters of madame de maintenon herself that she was indebted to madame de montespan for this small supply which delivered her from extreme poverty she was again noticed some years after when there was a necessity for educating privately the duke de maine whom the king had in    0 by the marchioness de montespan it was not surely until the year      that she was chosen to superintend this private education she says in one of her letters if the children are the kings i will cheerfully undertake the task but i would not willingly take the charge of madame de montespans children the king must therefore give me orders this is my last word madame de montespan had not two children until      the duke de maine and the count de vexin hence it is evident that the dates of madame de maintenons letters in    0 in which she speaks of those two children one of whom was not yet born must necessarily be false almost all the dates of these printed letters are equally erroneous this inaccuracy would give one reason to suspect the authenticity of these letters did we not discover in them such strong marks of truth and ingenuity as it is almost impossible to counterfeit it is a matter of no great consequence to know in what particular year this lady undertook the care of the natural children of louis xiv but the attention given to these minute circumstances may serve     to show with what scrupulous exactness we have related the principal events in this history the duke de maine was born with a deformed foot the first physician daquin who was in the secret advised sending him to the waters of barèges strict search was made for a person of integrity who might be intrusted with this precious charge the king mentioned madame scarron m de louvois went privately to paris to make the proposal to her from that time she had the care of the duke de maines education being appointed to that employment by the king and not by madame de montespan as has been reported she immediately wrote to the king who was greatly charmed with her letters such was the beginning of her good fortune her merit completed the rest the king who at first could not endure her company passed by degrees from aversion to confidence and from confidence to love his letters which still remain are a much more precious treasure than is commonly imagined they discover the mixture of religion and gallantry of dignity and weakness which is so frequently to be found in the human mind and which filled the soul of louis xiv the mind of madame de maintenon seems at once to be inspired with a true ambition and a true devotion her confessor gobelin approves equally of both he is alike a director and a courtier his penitent though guilty of ingratitude to madame de montespan still continues to dissemble her     crime the confessor encourages the illusion and she calls in religion to the assistance of her superannuated charms in order to supplant her benefactress who has now become her rival this strange mixture of love and scruples on the part of the king and of ambition and devotion on the part of the new mistress seems to have continued from    0 till      which was the era of their marriage her elevation was only a retreat shut up in her apartment which was on the same floor with that of the king she confined herself to the company of two or three ladies who had retired like herself and even these she saw but seldom the king went to her chamber every day after dinner and before and after supper and tarried with her until midnight he there deliberated with his ministers while madame de maintenon employed herself in reading or in needlework never displaying the least forwardness to talk of state affairs frequently seeming to be ignorant of them carefully avoiding everything that might have the least appearance of cabal or intrigue more desirous of pleasing him that governed than of governing herself and husbanding her interest with the greatest economy by never employing it without extreme circumspection she did not avail herself of her place to make all the dignities and great employments fall into her family her brother the count daubigné though an old lieutenantgeneral was not even a marshal     of france a blue ribbon and some appropriation in the farms of the public revenues were his only fortune hence it was said to marshal de vivonne brother of madame de montespan that he had received his marshals staff in ready money the marquis de villette her nephew or her cousin was only a commodore madame de cailus daughter of the marquis de villette had but a very small portion given her in marriage by louis xiv madame de maintenon when she married her niece daubigné to the son of the first marshal de noailles gave her but two hundred thousand livres the king made up the rest she endeavored to make the public excuse her elevation in favor of her disinterestedness the wife of the marquis de villette who was afterward lady bolingbroke could obtain nothing from her i have frequently heard her say that she upbraided her cousin with the little service she did her family and that she told her in a passion you obstinately persist to act up to your moderate plan and your family must be the victim of your moderation madame de maintenon forgot everything when she was in the least apprehensive of offending louis xiv she had not even the courage to support cardinal de noailles against father letellier she had a great friendship for racine but that friendship was not strong enough to protect him against a slight resentment of the king one day being deeply affected with the eloquence with which he represented the calamities of     the people in      calamities which are always exaggerated but which have since been carried to a deplorable pitch she prevailed upon her friend to draw up a memorial pointing out the evil and the remedy the king having read it and shown himself dissatisfied with the contents she had the weakness to name the author and to promise not to defend him racine still weaker if possible than she was seized with excessive grief which brought him to the grave the disposition which rendered her incapable of doing a service made her likewise incapable of doing an injury abbé de choisy relates that the minister louvois fell on his knees before louis xiv in order to dissuade him from marrying the widow scarron if abbé de choisy knew this fact madame de maintenon was not ignorant of it and yet she not only forgave that minister but she even appeased the first transports of passion into which the blunt behavior of the marquis de louvois sometimes threw his master hence it appears that louis xiv in marrying madame de maintenon only gave himself an agreeable submissive companion the only public distinction that discovered her private elevation was that at mass she occupied one of those little pulpits or gilded canopies which seemed to be made for the king and queen the devotion with which she had inspired the king and which had contributed to facilitate her marriage became by degrees a real and     deep sense of religion which was greatly strengthened by age and weariness she had already acquired both with the king and the court the character of a foundress by assembling at noisi a number of young ladies of quality and the king had appropriated the revenues of the abbey of st denis to this rising community st cyr was built at the end of the park of versailles in      she gave this settlement a complete form composed the regulations of it with godet desmarets bishop of chartres and was herself the superior of the convent she frequently went thither to pass a few hours and when i say that melancholy determined her to follow these amusements i only repeat her own words read what she wrote to madame de la maisonfort of whom mention is made in the chapter on quietism why cannot i give you my experience why cannot i make you sensible of the melancholy that devours the great and of the difficulty they have to dispose of their time do you not see that i die of lowness of spirits though possessed of a more splendid fortune than ever i could have hoped to obtain i have been young and handsome i have tasted pleasures i have been universally beloved in a more advanced age i have passed some years in the participation of intellectual pleasures i am now arrived at the summit of fortune and i assure you my dear that every condition leaves a horrid void in the soul   0 could anything undeceive men with regard to the pleasures of an exalted station this letter certainly would do it madame de maintenon who had no other cause of uneasiness than the uniformity of her life in the company of a great king said one day to the count daubigné her brother i can bear it no longer i wish i were dead the answer which her brother gave her is well known you have then got a promise said he of being married to the almighty upon the kings death she retired wholly to st cyr what is surprising is that the king left her no fixed salary he recommended her to the duke of orleans she desired only a pension of eighty thousand livres this annuity was regularly paid till her death april         the author of her epitaph has affected too much to forget the name of scarron this name is not a disgrace and the omission of it serves only to make one think that it is so the court became less gay and more serious from the time that the king began to lead a retired life with madame de maintenon and the severe fit of sickness he had in      contributed still more to destroy his taste for those splendid feasts which he had hitherto celebrated almost every year he was seized with a fistula in ano the art of surgery which under this reign had made greater progress in france than in all the rest of europe was not yet sufficiently acquainted with this condition cardinal de richelieu had died of it for want of proper treatment     the kings danger alarmed the whole nation the churches were filled with crowds of people who with tears in their eyes implored the recovery of their sovereign this expression of universal pity and lamentation was somewhat akin to that which happened in the present age when his successors life was in danger at metz in      these two epochs will serve as perpetual monuments to remind kings of what they owe to a people who love them with such a warmth of affection as soon as louis xiv felt the first attacks of his disease his chief surgeon felix went to the hospitals to search for such patients as were in the same condition he consulted the best surgeons and in conjunction with them he invented some new instruments which abridged the operation and rendered it less painful the king suffered the operation without complaining he caused his ministers to hold a council at his bedside the very same day and that the news of his danger might occasion no change of measures in the courts of europe he gave audience to the foreign ambassadors next day to this fortitude of mind may be added the generosity with which he rewarded felix to whom he gave an estate which was then worth fifty thousand crowns after this the king went no more to the public shows the dauphiness of bavaria being seized with a deep melancholy and oppressed with a lowness of spirits which brought her to the grave in    0 refused to join in any party of pleasure and     obstinately persisted in immuring herself in her chamber she was fond of learning she had composed some verses but in her melancholy she was fond of nothing but solitude it was the convent of st cyr that revived the taste for the polite arts madame de maintenon entreated racine who had renounced the theatre for the court and jansenism to write a tragedy that might be acted by her pupils and she desired the subject might be taken from the bible racine composed esther this play having been first represented in the convent of st cyr was afterward acted several times at versailles before the king in the winter of      the prelates and jesuits were eager to obtain permission to see this remarkable play it is somewhat surprising that this play was at this time universally approved and that two years after athalie which was acted by the same persons was as universally condemned the case was quite the reverse when they were played at paris long after the authors death and when all party distinctions were utterly abolished athalie was presented in      and was received as it deserved with great applause and esther which was presented in      excited no other feeling in the breasts of the spectators than languor and weariness and never appeared more but there were now no courtiers so complaisant as to recognize esther in madame de maintenon and so malicious as to discover     vashti in madame de montespan haman in m de louvois and especially the huguenots who were persecuted by that minister in the proscription of the jews the impartial public could discover nothing in that piece but a plot without probability and incapable of interesting the affections and a frantic king who had lived six months with his wife without knowing who she was and who having without the least pretext given orders for butchering a whole nation afterward caused his favorite to be hanged with as little reason but notwithstanding the imperfection of the plot thirty lines of esther are of more value than many tragedies which have met with great success these ingenious amusements were revived in order to forward the education of adelaide of savoy duchess of burgundy who was brought to france at eleven years of age it is one of the many contradictions in our manners that theatrical exhibitions should be branded with a mark of infamy and yet be considered as an amusement the most noble and most worthy of persons of royal birth a little theatre was built in the apartments of madame de maintenon on which the duchess of burgundy and the duke of orleans played with such persons of the court as were most remarkable for their wit and abilities the famous actor baron gave them lessons and played with them most of the tragedies of duché valet de chambre to the king were composed for this theatre and     abbé genêt almoner to the duchess of orleans wrote some plays for the duchess of maine which that princess and her court represented these amusements formed the taste of and enlivened society how could the marquis de la fare say in his memoirs that after the death of the dauphiness all was play confusion and impoliteness the courtiers frequently played in their excursions to marly and fontainebleau but never in the apartment of madame de maintenon and the court has always been considered as the standard of the most perfect politeness the duchess of orleans then duchess of chartres the duchess of maine the princess of conti and madame the duchess disproved by their conduct what the marquis de la fare asserts this man in the social intercourses of life discovered the greatest sweetness of temper and yet his writings may almost be considered as a satire he was dissatisfied with the government he passed his time in a society of men who made a merit of condemning the court and this society converted a man of a most amiable disposition into a historian who is sometimes unjust but neither he nor any of those who have censured louis xiv with so much severity can deny that till the battle of höchstädt he was the most powerful the most magnificent and the greatest man in the world for though there have been heroes such as john sobieski and the kings of sweden who have eclipsed him as a warrior no one has ever     been able to eclipse him as a monarch it must also be owned that he supported and repaired his losses he had failings he committed faults but would those who condemn him have been able to equal him had they been in his place the duchess of burgundy improved daily in beauty and merit the praises bestowed upon her sister in spain inspired her with an emulation which redoubled her talent of pleasing she was not a perfect beauty but she had a countenance like that of her son an air of grandeur and a majestic stature these advantages were greatly embellished by her wit and still more by her extreme desire of meriting the praises of all the world she was like henrietta of england the idol and the pattern of the court and possessed of a still higher rank as she was on the point of ascending the throne france expected from the duke of burgundy such a government as the sages of antiquity have figured to themselves but whose austerity would be softened by the virtues and accomplishments of this princess which were of a nature to be more sensibly felt than the philosophy of her husband everybody knows how these hopes were frustrated it was the fate of louis xiv to see all his family in france die premature deaths his wife in the fortyfifth year of her age his son in the fiftieth and in a year after he had lost his son he saw his grandson the dauphin his wife and their eldest son the duke of brittany carried to st denis in the same funeral car in april          while the youngest of their children who afterward mounted the throne was in his cradle at the point of death the duke of berry brother of the duke of burgundy followed them two years after and at the same time his daughter was carried from her cradle to her grave these lamentable losses made such a deep impression on the minds of men that i have seen several persons in the minority of louis xv who could not mention them without tears but amidst so many untimely deaths the fate of him who seemed likely to fill the throne in a short time was most to be lamented the same suspicions which prevailed at the death of madame and at that of maria louisa queen of spain were now revived with double fury the excess of the public grief might almost have excused the calumny could anything have excused it it was unreasonable to suppose that anyone would have taken off by a violent death so many royal persons and yet have left alive the only one that could avenge them the disease of which the dauphin of burgundy and his wife and son died was an epidemic purple fever this distemper destroyed more than five hundred persons in paris in the space of a month the duke of bourbon grandson of the prince of condé the duke de la trimouille madame de la vallière and madame de listenai were seized with it at court the marquis de gondrin son of the duke of antin died of it in two     days his wife afterward countess of toulouse was at the point of death this disease overran all france in lorraine it carried off the eldest son and daughter of francis that duke of lorraine who was destined by heaven to be one day emperor and to raise the house of austria from its state of depression meanwhile it was sufficient that a physician called bouden a debauched forward and ignorant fellow used the following expression we do not understand such diseases this i say was sufficient to make calumny rage without control the prince had a laboratory and studied chemistry as well as several other arts this was an unanswerable proof the clamor of the public was so terrible that one must have been a witness of it in order to believe it several pamphlets and some wretched histories of louis xiv would eternize these suspicions did not men who have had better opportunities of information take pains to destroy them i will venture to say that as i have long been sensible of the injustice of mankind i have made several inquiries to arrive at the truth and the following account has been frequently repeated to me by the marquis de canillac one of the most worthy men in the nation and intimately connected with the suspected prince of whom he had afterward just reason to complain the marquis de canillac amidst all this public clamor went to visit him in his palace he found him stretched at full length on     the ground bathed in tears and frantic with despair his chemist homberg ran to the bastille to surrender himself a prisoner but no orders had been given to receive him and accordingly he was not admitted the prince himself—who would believe it—in the excess of his grief desired to be taken into custody and to have an opportunity of clearing his innocence by a formal trial and his mother joined him in demanding this cruel satisfaction the lettre de cachet was made out but was not signed and the marquis alone amidst this general ferment preserved so much presence of mind as to perceive the dangerous consequences of such a desperate measure he prevailed upon the princes mother to oppose this ignominious lettre de cachet the monarch who granted it and the prince who demanded it were equally unhappy notes to chapter xxv montespan—the memoirs published under the name of madame de maintenon relate that she said to madame de montespan in speaking of her dreams i dreamed that we were on the grand staircase of versailles i was ascending you were descending i mounted to the clouds you went to fontevraut this story is borrowed from the famous duke dépernon who met cardinal richelieu on the staircase of the louvre in      the cardinal asked him what news none said he except that you are going up and i am coming down but the beauty of the allusion is destroyed by adding that from a staircase one could mount to the clouds it is to be remarked that in most books of anecdotes in the era the authors     always ascribe to their speakers things that have been said a century or even several centuries before montchevreuil—and not the chevalier de fourbin as the memoirs of choisy assert none are intrusted with such a secret but faithful domestics and people attached by their place to the person of their master there was no formal act of celebration that is only employed to prove the reality of the wedding but the present marriage was a marriage of conscience how could anyone have the impudence to report that after the death of harlay archbishop of paris which happened in      almost ten years after the marriage his lackeys found the form of the marriage ceremony in his old breeches this story which is even too mean for lackeys is only to be found in the memoirs of maintenon maintenon—it is said in the pretended memoirs of maintenon tom i page     that for a long time she lay in the same bed with the celebrated ninon lenclos according to the hearsay reports of the abbé de châteauneuf and of the author of the age of louis xiv but there is not a syllable of such an anecdote to be found in the author of the age of louis xiv nor in the remaining works of the abbé de châteauneuf the author of maintenons memoirs quotes only at random this circumstance is mentioned nowhere except in the memoirs of the marquis de la fare page   0 amsterdam edition it was a custom it is true for people to share their beds with their friends and this custom which is now extinct was very ancient even at court we find in the history of france that charles ix in order to save the count de brissac from the massacre of st bartholomew advised him to sleep at the louvre in his bed and that the duke of guise and the prince of condé lay together for a long time maintenon—who would imagine that in the memoirs of madame de maintenon iii page     it should be said that this minister was afraid of being poisoned by the king strange that in paris we should publish horrid falsehoods at the end of so many ridiculous fables  00 this stupid and shocking story is founded on a common report which was spread abroad after the death of the marquis de louvois this minister was using the waters which seron his physician had prescribed for him and which la ligerie his surgeon made him drink this is the same ligerie who gave the public the remedy which is now called the poudre des chartreux this la ligerie has frequently told me that he apprised m de louvois of the great risk he ran by laboring while he drank the waters the minister however continued to attend to business as usual he died suddenly on july         and not in      as the author of these false memoirs asserts la ligerie opened his body and found no other cause of his death than what he had foretold some people suspected that seron had poisoned a bottle of these waters we have seen how common these injurious suspicions then were it was pretended that a neighboring gentleman whom louvois had greatly provoked and abused bribed seron some of these anecdotes are to be found in the memoirs of the marquis de fare page     the family of the marquis de louvois did even imprison a native of lavay who was a menial servant in the house but this poor man who was perfectly innocent was soon released but if people suspected though very unreasonably that a prince who was an enemy to france endeavored to take away the life of a minister of louis xiv this surely could never be a reason for suspecting louis himself of the same crime the same author who in the memoirs of madame de maintenon has collected such a heap of falsehoods alleges in the same place that the king said that he had got rid in one year of three men whom he could not endure the marshal de la feuillade the marquis de seignelay and the marquis de louvois in the first place m de seignelay did not die in      but in    0 in the second place to whom did louis xiv who always spoke with great circumspection and like a gentleman to whom did he address these imprudent and hateful words to whom did he discover such a cruel and ungrateful heart  0  to whom could he say that he was glad that he had got rid of three men who had served him with so much zeal and fidelity is it lawful thus to blacken without the least proof without the least appearance of probability the memory of a king who was always known to speak with great prudence every sensible reader beholds with contempt and indignation this collection of lies with which the public is surfeited maintenon—the author of the memoirs of madame de maintenon tom iv in a chapter entitled mademoiselle choin says that the dauphin was in love with one of his own sisters and that he afterward married mademoiselle choin these popular reports are known to be false by every sensible man one should not only be a contemporary but should be furnished with proofs before he ventures to advance such anecdotes as these there never was the least evidence of the dauphins having married mademoiselle choin to revive after the expiration of sixty years these common reports so vague so improbable and so generally condemned is not to write history it is to compile at random the most scandalous falsehoods in order to gain money upon what foundation has this writer the impudence to advance in page     that the duchess of burgundy said to her husband if i were dead would you compose the third volume of your family he makes louis xiv and all the princes and ministers talk as though he had heard them there is scarcely a page in the memoirs that is not filled with such barefaced lies as justly to excite the indignation of every virtuous person louis the great—if greatness of soul consists in a love of pageantry an ostentation of fastidious pomp a prodigality of expense an affectation of munificence an insolence of ambition and a haughty reserve of deportment louis certainly deserved the appellation of great qualities which are really heroic we shall not find in the composition of his character abbé castel de st pierre author of several strange performances in which there are many things of a philosophical  0  but very few of a practical nature has left behind him some political annals from      till      which are probably suppressed he in several places condemns the administration of louis xiv with great severity and will not by any means allow him the title of louis the great if by great he means perfect this title to be sure does not belong to him but from these memoirs written with the hand of that monarch it appears that he had as good political principles at least as the abbé de st pierre marquis de canillac—the author of the life of the duke of orleans was the first that mentioned these cruel suspicions he was a jesuit of the name of la motte who preached at rouen against this prince during his regency and who afterward took refuge in holland under the name of la hode he was acquainted with some public facts he says tom i p     that the prince who was so unjustly suspected offered to surrender himself a prisoner and this is very true la motte had no opportunity of knowing how m de canillac opposed this step which was so injurious to the princes innocence all the other anecdotes he relates are false reboulet who copied his says tom viii p     the youngest child of the duke and duchess of burgundy was saved by the counterpoison of venice there is no counterpoison of venice that is thus given at random physic knows no general antidotes that cure a disease the cause of which is unknown all the stories which were spread abroad in the world at that unhappy time are no more than a collection of popular errors it is a falsehood of little consequence in the compiler of the memoirs of madame de maintenon to say that the duke of maine was then at the point of death it is a childish calumny to say that the author of the age of louis xiv rather confirms than destroys the credit of these stories never was history disgraced with more absurd falsehoods than in these pretended memoirs the author pretends to have written them in      he supposes that the  0  duke and duchess of burgundy and their eldest son died of smallpox he advances this falsehood to give himself an opportunity to speak of inoculation an experiment that was not tried till may      thus in the same page we find him speaking in      of what happened in      and he expresses himself thus this   th of april      i was interrupted an order came from the king to tear me from my family and myself he then relates how he was thrown into prison and accuses persons who never saw him of having informed the government against him the same man in the edition of the age of louis xiv which he published at frankfort in      had attacked in his notes the memory of the duke of orleans on pp     and     tom ii of this spurious edition learning has been infected with so many kinds of defamatory libels and the dutch have published so many false memoirs and injurious aspersions on the government and the people that it is the duty of every faithful historian to caution the reader against the imposture chapter xxvi last years of louis xiv louis xiv concealed his grief from the world and appeared in public as usual but in private the pain of so many misfortunes pierced him to the heart and threw him into convulsions he met with all these domestic losses toward the conclusion of an unsuccessful war before he was sure of obtaining a peace and at a time when famine laid waste the kingdom and yet he was never seen to sink under his afflictions the remaining part of his life was unhappy the disordered state of the finances which he was unable  0  to rectify alienated the minds of the people the unbounded confidence he placed in father letellier a man of too violent passions completed the disgust it is remarkable that the public who freely forgave him his love to his mistress could never forgive him his attachment to his confessor he lost during the last three years of his life in the minds of most of his subjects all the respect and esteem he had gained by his great and memorable actions deprived of almost all his children his love which was now redoubled to the duke of maine and the count of toulouse his illegitimate sons caused him to declare them heirs to the crown them and their descendants in default of princes of the blood by an edict that was registered without opposition in      he thus tempered by the law of nature the severity of positive laws which deprive children born out of marriage of all right of succeeding to their fathers estate but kings dispense with this law he thought he might safely do for his own blood what he had done for several of his subjects he imagined particularly that he might make the same establishment for two of his children which he had caused to be made in parliament for the princes of the house of lorraine he afterward raised them to the same rank as princes of the blood in      the suit commenced by the princes of the blood against the legitimated princes is well known the latter preserved for themselves and their children the honors conferred on them by louis  0  xiv but the fate of their posterity must depend on time on merit and on fortune louis xiv was seized about the middle of august      on his return from marly with the disease that brought him to the grave his legs were swelled a mortification began to appear the earl of stair the english ambassador laid a wager according to the custom of his country that the king would not outlive the month of september the duke of orleans who in his journey to marly had no attendants had now the whole court about him an empiric in the last days of the kings illness gave him an elixir which revived his spirits he ate and the empiric affirmed he would recover the crowds which surrounded the duke of orleans began to diminish apace if the king eats a second time said the duke of orleans i shall not have a single person in my leveé but the disease was mortal measures were taken for giving the regency with an absolute authority to the duke of orleans the king by his will which was deposited with the parliament had left it to him under great limitations or rather had only appointed him the head of a council of regency in which he would have had only the casting vote and yet he said to him i have preserved to you all the rights to which you are entitled by your birth the reason was that he did not believe there was a fundamental law in the kingdom which gives during a minority an absolute power to the presumptive heir of the crown this supreme authority  0  which may be easily abused is no doubt dangerous but a divided authority is still more dangerous he imagined that having been so faithfully obeyed during his life he would be equally so after his death not remembering that the will of his father had been violated everybody knows with what greatness of soul he beheld the approach of death he said to madame de maintenon i imagined it was more difficult to die and to his servants why do you weep did you think me immortal he gave orders about several things and even about the funeral solemnity whoever has many witnesses of his death always dies with courage louis xiii in his last illness set to music the psalm de profundis which was to be sung at his funeral the fortitude of mind with which louis xiv beheld his end was divested of that glare of ostentation which covered the rest of his life he had the courage even to acknowledge his errors his successor has always kept under his pillow the remarkable words which that monarch spoke to him as he sat up in his bed and held him in his arms these words are not such as have been represented in all former histories the following is a faithful copy you are soon to be the king of a great kingdom what i would chiefly recommend to you is never to forget the obligation you are under to god remember that you are indebted to him for all that you are endeavor to preserve peace with your  0  neighbors i have been too fond of war in this do not follow my example any more than in my too expensive manner of living take counsel in everything endeavor to distinguish what is best and always take care to pursue it relieve your subjects as much as you can and do what i have been so unhappy as not to be able to do myself etc this speech contains nothing of that meanness of spirit which is ascribed to him in some memoirs he has been reproached for carrying some relics about him during the latter years of his life his sentiments of religion were noble and elevated but his confessor who was of a different character had subjected him to some practices little consistent with these sentiments and now disused in order to subject him the more absolutely to his direction though the life and death of louis xiv were certainly glorious yet was he less lamented than he deserved the love of novelty the approach of a minority in which everyone hoped to make a fortune the dispute about the constitution which then exasperated the minds of the people all conspired to make the news of his death be received with something more than indifference we beheld the same people who in      had importuned heaven with tears and sighs for the recovery of their sick monarch follow his funeral procession with demonstrations of a very different nature it is pretended that the queen his mother said to him when he was very young my son imitate your grandfather and not  0  your father the king having asked the reason she said because the people wept at the death of henry iv and laughed at that of louis xiii notwithstanding that he has been reproached with littleness of mind in his zeal against the jansenists with too much haughtiness to foreigners in his prosperity with too great indulgence to several women and too great severity in personal concerns with wars undertaken without sufficient reason with the burning of the palatinate and the persecution of the protestants yet his great qualities and glorious actions being placed in the scale have at last more than counterpoised all his imperfections time which rectifies the opinions of mankind has stamped his reputation with the seal of immortality and in spite of all that has been written against him his name will never be mentioned without respect or without reviving the idea of an age forever memorable if we consider him in his private character we shall find him indeed too full of his own greatness but withal affable refusing his mother a share in the administration but performing to her all the duties of a son and observing the strictest rules of decency and decorum in his behavior to his wife a good father a good master always decent in public laborious in the cabinet exact in the management of his affairs thinking justly speaking fluently and amiable with dignity i have elsewhere remarked that he never spoke the words which have been ascribed to him when the a  0  first gentleman of the bedchamber and the grand master of the wardrobe were disputing about the honor of serving him what does it signify which of my valets serves me such a coarse expression could never be used by a man so polite and so considerate as louis xiv and agreed but ill with what he afterward said to one of these gentlemen when talking of his debts why do you not speak to your friends words of a very different meaning and of great importance being accompanied with a present of fifty thousand crowns  nor is it true that he wrote to the duke de la rochefoucauld i give you my compliments as your friend with regard to the post of grand master of the wardrobe which i give you as your king the historians have done him the honor of this letter not remembering how very indelicate and even cruel it is to tell a man whose master you are that you are his master this would be very proper were a sovereign writing to a rebellious subject and henry iv might justly enough have said it to the duke of mayenne before a reconciliation was effected rose secretary of the closet wrote the letter but the king had too much good sense to send it it was the same good sense that made him suppress the pompous inscriptions which charpentier of the french academy affixed to the paintings of le brun in the gallery of versailles the incredible passage of the rhine the marvellous taking of valenciennes etc the king thought that the taking   0 of valenciennes and the passage of the rhine were more expressive charpentier was in the right to adorn with inscriptions in our language the monuments of our country flattery alone spoiled the execution some smart answers and witty expressions of this prince have been collected which are reducible to a very small number it is pretended that when he formed the design of abolishing calvinism in france he said my grandfather loved the huguenots and did not fear them my father feared them but did not love them for my own part i neither love nor fear them having given in      the place of first president of the parliament of paris to m de lamoignon then master of requests he said to him had i known a worthier man or a better subject i would have chosen him he used much the same expression to cardinal de noailles when he gave him the archbishopric of paris what constitutes the merit of these words is that they were true and inspired a principle of virtue it is said that a foolish preacher having one day pointed him out at versailles—a rashness that is not allowable toward a private man and far less toward a king—louis xiv contented himself with saying to him father i like well enough to take my share of a sermon but do not choose to be made the subject of it whether he used this expression or not it may serve as a lesson     he always expressed himself with majesty and precision studying in public to speak as well as to act like a sovereign when the duke of anjou was setting out on his journey to ascend the throne of spain he said to him in order to mark the union which would for the future unite the two nations remember there are now no pyrenees nothing surely can set his character in a clearer light than the following memorial written entirely with his own hand kings are frequently obliged to do many things contrary to their inclination and which shock the natural humanity of their temper they should take pleasure in doing favors and they are often forced to punish and even to ruin those to whom they naturally wish well the interest of the state should hold the first place they must force their inclinations they must act in every matter of importance so as to have no cause to reproach themselves with the thought of having been able to do better but some private interests prevented me from following this course and engrossed that attention which i should have employed in promoting the grandeur the happiness and the power of the state there are many circumstances that create uneasiness there are some so intricate that it is difficult to unravel them we have confused ideas and while that is the case we may remain long without coming to any determination but the moment we have formed our resolution and are convinced that it is the best we     should carry it into execution it is to the observance of this maxim that i have frequently owed my success in several of my undertakings the errors i have committed and which have given me infinite pain have been owing to complaisance and to a too ready compliance with the advice of others nothing is so dangerous as weakness of every kind to be able to command others we must raise ourselves above them and after having heard the opinions of all parties we must fix upon that which we judge to be best without prejudice or partiality always careful not to order or execute anything unworthy of ourselves of the character we bear or of the grandeur of the state princes who have good intentions and some knowledge of their own affairs whether by experience study or intense application find so many ways of discovering their natural disposition that they should take particular care of themselves and of all around them we should constantly be on our guard against ourselves our inclinations and our natural propensities the employment of a king is grand noble and agreeable especially when he finds himself able to perform his duty but it is not exempted from pain fatigue and inquietude uncertainty sometimes occasions despair when therefore he has employed a reasonable time in examining an affair he should come to a determination and pursue the course which he thinks most advisable when he labors for the state he labors for himself     the welfare of the one constitutes the glory of the other when the former is great happy and powerful he who is the cause of all these advantages is glorious and consequently should both on his own account and that of his subjects enjoy a greater share of all that is most pleasant and agreeable in life when he has committed an error he should repair it as soon as possible and should allow no consideration to hinder him not even good nature itself in      there died a man who had the post of secretary of state being charged with the department of foreign affairs he was a man of capacity but not without faults he filled that important post with great ability i was some time in considering to whom i should commit this weighty charge and after mature deliberation i found that a man who had long served me in the character of an ambassador was most likely to fill it with success i ordered him to return home all the world approved of my choice which is not always the case on his return i put him in possession of the post i knew him only by report and by the commissions with which i had charged him and which he had executed with great fidelity but the employment i had now given him was too great and too extensive for his narrow capacity i have not availed myself of all the advantages i might have obtained and this has always been owing to my complaisance     and good nature at last i was obliged to order him to retire because all that passed through his hands lost that air of grandeur and importance which should ever attend the execution of the orders of a king of france had i been so wise as to have removed him sooner i should have prevented many of the misfortunes which afterward befell me and should have had no cause to reproach myself with allowing my indulgence to him to hurt the state these particulars i have thought proper to mention in order to confirm the truth of what i advanced above this precious and hitherto unknown monument will serve to convince posterity of the integrity of his heart and the greatness of his soul we may even say that he judges himself with too much severity and that he has no cause to reproach himself with regard to m de pompone since the great services and reputation of that minister determined the princes choice which was likewise confirmed by the general approbation of the public and if he condemns himself for his choice of m de pompone who at least had the happiness to serve during a glorious period what should he say with regard to m de chamillard whose ministry was so unfortunate and so universally condemned he had written several memoirs in this style either with a view of keeping an account of his own conduct or for the instruction of the dauphin duke of burgundy these reflections succeeded the     events he would have attained nearer to perfection to which his merit entitled him to aspire had he been able to form to himself a philosophy superior to the politics and prejudices of the times—philosophy which in the space of so many centuries we have seen practised by so few sovereigns and which kings are very excusable for not understanding since it is understood by so few private men the following are a few of the many instructions which louis xiv gave to his grandson philip v when he was setting out on his journey for spain he wrote them in haste and with a negligence that shows the soul much better than a studied discourse we behold in them the father and the king love the spaniards and all your subjects who are attached to your crown and person dont prefer those that flatter you most esteem such as for the public good will run the risk of displeasing you these are your true friends promote the happiness of your subjects and with this view never undertake a war until you are forced to it and until you have fully weighed and examined the reasons for and against it in your council endeavor to lower your taxes take care of the indies and of your fleets give great attention to commerce and live in a perfect union with france nothing being so advantageous for both kingdoms as this union which no power can resist     if you are obliged to make war put yourself at the head of your army endeavor to reestablish your troops upon their former footing in all your dominions and begin with those of flanders never neglect business for pleasure but form to yourself a kind of plan which will allow you proper times for amusements and diversions of these there are hardly any more innocent than hunting and the pleasures of a country house provided you are not too expensive in your decorations give great attention to business when anyone talks to you on that subject hear much at first without making any decision when once you have acquired more knowledge remember that it is your province to decide but whatever experience you may have be always sure to hear the opinions and reasonings of your council before you come to a decision exert your utmost sagacity and penetration in order to find men of the greatest abilities that so you may properly employ them take care that your viceroys and governors be always spaniards treat everybody well never say a disagreeable thing to anyone but distinguish people of quality and merit show the grateful sense you have of the kindness     of the late king and all of those who have concurred in choosing you for his successor place great confidence in cardinal portocarrero and let him know how much you are pleased with the conduct he has pursued i think you ought to do something considerable for the ambassador who had the happiness to invite you into the kingdom and to salute you first in the quality of a subject do not forget bedmar who is a man of merit and is capable of serving you place an unreserved confidence in the duke dharcourt he is a man of capacity and of honor and will never give you any advice but what is for your interest keep all the french in order use your domestics well but never admit them into too great a degree of familiarity and far less of confidence employ them as long as they behave well but send them back on the least fault they commit and never support them against the spaniards have no intercourse with the queendowager but such as you cannot dispense with see that she quits madrid but let her not go out of spain wherever she is observe her conduct and never allow her to interfere in any affairs of state suspect the fidelity of those who have too much intercourse with her always love your relatives remember the pain     it cost them to part with you preserve a constant intercourse with them as well in small as in great things ask from us freely whatever you either want or desire to have that is not to be found in your own country and we will use the same freedom with you never forget that you are a frenchman nor what may possibly befall you when you have secured the succession of spain by children visit your kingdoms go to naples and sicily pass over to milan and come to flanders this will give you an opportunity of paying us a visit meanwhile visit catalonia aragon and other places see what improvements may be made at ceuta throw some money to the people when you are in spain and especially when you enter madrid dont seem to be shocked at the strange figures you may see ridicule nothing every country has its particular manners and you will soon be familiarized to what at first may appear most surprising avoid as much as possible the granting of favors to those who give you money in order to obtain them give with discretion and liberality and never receive any presents unless they be trifles if it should sometimes happen that you are obliged to receive them be always sure in a few days after to return greater presents to those who gave them have a strong box in which you may deposit     anything particular and keep the key of it yourself i shall conclude with one of the most important advices i can give you do not suffer yourself to be governed be master yourself have no favorite nor prime minister hear and consult your council but decide yourself and god who has made you king will give you such degrees of light and knowledge as are necessary for you in proportion to the rectitude of your intentions louis xiv was more remarkable for a just and noble manner of thinking than for brilliant sallies of wit besides we do not expect that a king should say memorable things but that he should do them what is necessary for every man in power is that he should never suffer anyone to leave his presence in a bad humor but should render himself agreeable to all who approach him we cannot always do generous actions but we can always say obliging things louis had acquired this excellent habit between him and his court there was a perpetual interchange of all the graces that majesty could show without being degraded and all the arts which eagerness to serve and solicitude to please could show without abasement in the company of the ladies especially he displayed a politeness and complaisance which increased that of his courtiers and with the men he never missed an opportunity of saying such things as flattered their selflove at the   0 same time that they excited their emulation and left a deep impression on the mind one day the duchess of burgundy when she was very young observing an officer at supper who was remarkably disagreeable began to jest on his ugliness with great freedom and in a very high tone i think him madam said the king in a still higher tone one of the handsomest men in my kingdom for he is one of the bravest a general officer a man of blunt address and who had not polished his manners even in the court of louis xiv had lost an arm in an engagement and was making his complaints to the king who however had rewarded him as much as the loss of an arm could be recompensed i wish said he i had lost my other arm likewise that so i might never serve your majesty more i should have been extremely sorry for that said the king both on your account and my own and immediately granted him a considerable favor he was so far from saying disagreeable things which in the mouth of a prince are deadly arrows that he never indulged himself even in the most innocent and harmless railleries while private men daily use the most severe and cruel he frequently diverted himself and even excelled in those ingenious things called impromptus and agreeable songs and he sometimes composed extempore little parodies on the songs most in vogue such as this       chez mon cadet de frère   le chancelier serrant   nest pas trop nécessaire   et le sage boifrant   est celui qui sait plaire   theres phil my younger brother   with chancellor serrant   he seldom makes a pother   he likes wise boifrant   much better than the other and this other which he made one day in dismissing the council   le conseil à ses yeux a beau se présenter   sitôt quil voit sa chienne il quitte tout pour elle   rien ne peut larrêter   quand la chasse lappelle   the council in vain at his elbow appears   when his bitch comes across from all business hell fly   nought else he minds or sees or hears   when once the hounds are in full cry these trifles serve at least to show that the charms of wit composed one of the pleasures of his court that he partook in these pleasures and that he was as capable of living like a private man as of acting the great monarch on the theatre of the world his letter to the archbishop of rheims concerning the marquis de barbèsieux though in a very careless style does more honor to his heart than the most ingenious thoughts could have done to his head he had given this youth the post of secretary of war which had been formerly possessed by his father the marquis de louvois but being soon dissatisfied     with the conduct of his new secretary he resolved to correct him without giving him too great mortification with this view he applied to his uncle the archbishop of rheims and desired him to advise his nephew and shows himself a master informed of everything while he had all the tenderness of a father i know says he what i owe to the memory of m de louvois but if your nephew does not alter his conduct i shall be obliged to do what i shall be sorry for but there will be a necessity for it he has talents but does not make a good use of them he spends too much time in giving entertainments to the princes instead of minding business he neglects the public affairs for his pleasures he makes the officers wait too long in his antechamber he speaks to them with haughtiness and even sometimes with rudeness this is all that i remember of this letter which i once saw in the original it plainly shows that louis xiv was not governed by his ministers as has been reported but that he knew how to govern them he was fond of praise and it were to be wished the kings were more fond of it so that they might endeavor to deserve it but louis xiv did not always swallow it when it was too strong and excessive when our academy which always gave him an account of the subjects it proposed for prizes showed him the following which of all the virtues     of the king deserves the preference the king blushed and would not allow the subject to be treated of he suffered it is true the prologues of quinault but it was in the height of his glory and at a time when the intoxication of the people was some apology for his virgil and horace from a principle of gratitude and ovid from the most contemptible meanness of spirit loaded augustus with praises far more extravagant and if we consider the proscriptions much less deserved had corneille said to any of the courtiers in cardinal de richelieus chamber tell the cardinal that i understand poetry better than he the minister would never have forgiven him and yet this is the very thing that despréaux said openly to his majesty in a dispute that happened about some verses which the king thought good and despréaux condemned he is in the right said the king he understands the subject better than i do the duke de vendôme had in his retinue a person called villiers one of those men of pleasure who make a merit of talking with a cynical freedom he lodged at versailles in the dukes apartment he was commonly called villiers vendôme this man openly condemned the taste of louis xiv in music in painting in architecture in gardening and in everything else if the king planted a grove furnished an apartment or built a fountain villiers found it to be illcontrived and expressed his disapprobation in very indiscreet terms it is strange     said the king that villiers should have chosen my house to laugh at everything i do having one day met him in the garden well said he to him showing him at the same time one of his new performances has not that the good fortune to please you no said villiers and yet replied the king there are several people who do not dislike it that may be returned villiers everyone has his own way of thinking the king replied with a smile it is impossible to please all the world one day louis xiv playing at ticktack had a doubtful throw a dispute arose and the courtiers remained in the most profound silence at that instant the count de gramont arrived decide this question said the king to him sire said the count your majesty is in the wrong how replied the king can you accuse me of being in the wrong before you know what the question is because said the count had the matter been in the least doubtful all these gentlemen would have given it for your majesty the duke of antin distinguished himself in this age by a singular art not of saying flattering things but of doing them the king went to pass a night at petitbourg when he found fault with a long alley of trees which concealed the view of the river the duke caused them to be cut down in the night next morning the king was surprised at not seeing the trees with which he had found fault it is replied     the duke because your majesty found fault with them that you no longer behold them we have elsewhere remarked that the same man observing that a pretty large wood at the end of the canal of fontainebleau displeased the king at the minute when his majesty went to take a walk in it everything being ready for the purpose he ordered the trees to be cut down and in a moment they were levelled with the ground these are the strokes of an ingenious courtier and not of a flattering sycophant louis xiv has been accused of intolerable pride for suffering the base of his statue in the place des victoires to be surrounded with slaves in fetters but neither this statue nor that in the place de vendôme was erected by him the statue in the place des victoires is a monument of the greatness of soul of the first marshal de la feuillade and of his gratitude to his royal master he expended on this statue five hundred thousand livres amounting nearly to a million of our present money and the city added as much more to render the place regular it seems equally unjust to impute to louis xiv the pride of this statue and to find nothing but vanity and flattery in the magnanimity of the marshal nothing was talked of but the four slaves though they rather represent vices subdued than nations conquered duelling abolished and heresy destroyed for so the inscriptions import they likewise celebrate     the junction of the sea and the peace of nimeguen they talk of nothing but benefits and none of the slaves has the least resemblance to the people conquered by louis xiv besides it is an ancient practice among sculptors to place slaves at the feet of the statues of kings it would be better indeed to represent there free and happy subjects but to conclude we see slaves at the feet of the merciful henry iv and of louis xiii at paris we see them at leghorn under the statue of ferdinand de medici who never sure enslaved any nation and we see them at berlin under the statue of an elector who repulsed the swedes but made no conquests the neighbors of france and even the french themselves have with great injustice made louis xiv answerable for this custom the inscription viro immortali to the immortal man has been accused of idolatry as if that expression meant any more than the immortality of his glory the inscription of viviani on his house at florence ædes a deo datœ the house given by god would be still more idolatrous it is no more however than an allusion to the surname dieudonne and to the verse of virgil deus nobis hœc otia fecit with regard to the statue in the place de vendôme it was erected by the city the latin inscriptions on the four sides of its base display a more gross kind of flattery than the statue in the place des victoires we there read that louis xiv never took arms but with reluctance to this adulation     he solemnly gave the lie on his deathbed by those words which will be remembered longer than these inscriptions unknown to him and produced by the meanness of spirit of some men of letters the king had set apart the houses of this square for his public library the place was too large it had at first three sides which were those of an immense palace the walls were already built when the calamities that happened in   0  obliged the city to build private houses on the ruins of the palace which was already begun thus the louvre was never finished thus the fountain and the obelisk which colbert intended to raise opposite to the gate of perrault never appeared but in embryo thus the beautiful gate of st gervais remained in obscurity and most of the monuments of paris fill us only with sorrow the nation wished that louis xiv had preferred his louvre and his capital to the palace of versailles which the duke de créqui called a favorite without merit posterity admires with the most grateful remembrance the great and noble things he did for the public welfare but our admiration is mixed with censure when we behold all the magnificence and defects that louis xiv has introduced into his house in the country from all we have said it appears that louis xiv loved grandeur and glory in everything a prince who should perform as great things as he and     yet be modest and humble would be the first of kings and louis only the second if he repented on his deathbed of having undertaken war without just reason it must be owned that he did not judge by events for of all his wars the most just and the most indispensable—that in   0 —was the only unfortunate one he had by his queen besides the dauphin two sons and three daughters who died in their infancy his amours were more successful there were only two of his natural children that died in the cradle eight of them were legitimated and five of them had children he had likewise by a lady who lived much with madame de montespan a daughter whom he never acknowledged and whom he married to a gentleman near versailles of the name of le queue some people suspected and not without reason that a certain lady in the abbey of moret was his daughter she was very brown and resembled him in other respects the king when he placed her in the convent gave her a portion of twenty thousand crowns the opinion she had of her birth gave her an air of pride of which the superiors of the convent loudly complained madame de maintenon in a journey to fontainebleau went to the convent of moret and willing to inspire this nun with more modest sentiments endeavored to banish the idea that nourished her pride madam said the nun the trouble which a lady of your rank takes to come     on purpose to tell me that i am not the kings daughter fully convinces me that i am this anecdote the nuns of moret remember to this day such a particularity of circumstances would be irksome to a philosopher but curiosity that weakness so incident to mankind ceases almost to be a weakness when it is employed about times and personages which attract the attention of posterity notes on chapter xxvi philip v of spain—the king of spain profited by these wholesome advices he was a virtuous prince the author of the memoirs of madame de maintenon tom v p  00 accuses him of having had a scandalous supper with the princess of ursino the day after the death of his first wife and of having intended to marry that lady whom he loads with the most bitter invectives it must be observed that the princess of ursino who had been maid of honor to the deceased queen was then in the sixtieth year of her age these popular reports which should be buried in oblivion become calumnies that deserve the most severe punishment when people have the impudence to print them and endeavor to sully the most respectable names without the least proof   0 chapter xxvii government commerce laws military discipline under louis xiv this justice we owe to persons of a public character who have done good to the age they have lived in that we should view the point from which they have set out in order to form a just idea of the changes they have produced in their own country posterity is eternally indebted to them for the examples they have given even though these are surpassed this just glory is their only recompense it is certain that the love of such glory animated louis xiv when beginning to govern by himself he had resolved to reform his kingdom embellish his court and perfect the arts he not only imposed it as a law upon himself to labor regularly with each of his ministers but every man that was but known might obtain a particular audience of him and all citizens had the liberty of presenting their requests and projects the petitions were received at first by a master of requests who marked them on the margin and they were afterward sent to the officers of the ministers the projects were examined in council when they deserved it and their authors were admitted more than once to discuss the points they contained with the ministers in presence of their master thus we see a correspondence subsisting between the     throne and the nation notwithstanding absolute power louis xiv accustomed himself to labor and this was so much the more painful as it was new to him and the seduction of pleasures might easily distract him he wrote the first despatches himself to his ambassadors the most important letters were often afterward minuted with his own hand and there was none written in his name which he did not cause to be read to him scarcely had colbert after the fall of fouquet reestablished order in the finances before the king remitted to his people all the arrears due on the imposts from      till      and especially three millions of taille or excise the enormous duties were abolished for five hundred thousand crowns a year thus abbé de choisy seems either to have been very ill informed or to be guilty of very great injustice when he says that the public receipt was not diminished for it is certain that it was lessened by these indulgent remissions and increased by good order the care of the first president de bellièvre assisted by the liberalities of the duchess daiguillon and several citizens had established the general hospital the king augmented it and caused similar edifices to be erected in all the principal towns of the kingdom the great roads till that time impassable were not neglected and by degrees they have become     what they are now under the reign of louis xv—the admiration of foreigners on whatever side you come out of paris you travel at present from fifty to sixty leagues and in some places of the neighborhood through close alleys bordered with trees the roads made by the ancient romans were more durable indeed but not so spacious nor so beautiful colberts genius turned chiefly toward commerce which was but weakly cultivated and its grand principles were not yet known the english and the dutch still more carried on in their own bottoms almost the whole traffic of france the dutch especially loaded with our merchandise in our ports and distributed it all over europe the king began from      to exempt his subjects from an impost called the duty of freight which all the vessels of foreigners paid and he granted the french the indulgence of transporting their merchandise themselves at less expense it was then that maritime commerce had its birth the council for that department which at present continues was established and in it the king presided every fifteenth day dunkirk and marseilles were declared free ports and soon afterward this advantage drew the trade of the levant to marseilles and that of the north to dunkirk in      was formed a west india company and that of the east indies was established the same year before this time france paid tribute for her luxuries to the dutch the partisans of the ancient     economy who were timid ignorant and had contracted views declaimed in vain against a commerce in which a continual exchange was made of money that would not perish for effects which do they did not reflect that these merchandises of india which were become necessary would be more dearly paid for by foreigners we carry indeed to the east indies more kinds of goods than we bring from there and by that means europe is impoverished but these come from peru and mexico they are the price of our goods carried to cadiz and there remains more of this money in france than the east indies absorb of it the king gave more than six millions of our present currency to the company he invited rich people to embark in it the queens the princes and all the court furnished two millions of the coin of that time the superior courts gave twelve hundred thousand livres the financiers two millions the body of merchants six hundred and fifty thousand livres so the whole nation seconded their king this company has always subsisted for though the dutch had taken pondicherry in      and the commerce of the indies has languished ever since it has recovered in our days new strength pondicherry has become a rival to batavia and this india company founded with extreme difficulty by the great colbert and reestablished in our days by singular revolutions is now one of the greatest resources of the kingdom the king also founded a     company of the north in      he invested funds in it as he did in that of the indies it was then very plain that commerce is no disgrace to any since the greatest houses interested themselves in these establishments after the example of the monarch the west india company was no less encouraged than the others the king furnished the tenth part of all the funds he granted thirty francs per ton for exportation and forty for importation all those who had vessels built in the ports of the kingdom received five livres for each ton they contained yet one cannot forbear being very much surprised that abbé de choisy has censured these establishments in his memoirs which cannot be read without some mistrust we are sensible in our days of all that colbert did for the benefit of the kingdom but at that time we were entirely ignorant of it he worked for ungrateful people they were much more disgusted with him in paris for the suppression of certain rents on the town house purchased at a cheap rate since      and for the discredit into which the notes of the kings privy treasury fell that were squandered under the preceding minister than they were sensible of the general good which he did in this affair were concerned more burgesses than good citizens few people had an eye to the public advantage it is well known what a fascinating power interest has upon the eyes and how it contracts the mind i do not mean this only concerning     the interest of a single trader but that of a company and even a town the clownish answer of a merchant called hazon—who upon being consulted by this minister told him you have found the carriage overset on one side and have overturned it on the other—was still obsequiously quoted in my young days and this anecdote is to be met with in moréri the philosophic spirit introduced very late into france reformed the prejudices of the people so as to make them at length do entire justice to the memory of this great man he had the same exactness as the duke de sully but withal he had views which were much more extensive the one was acquainted only with economy but the other knew how to form grand establishments almost everything was either repaired or created in his time the reduction of interest on the twentieth denier on the loans given to the king and particular persons was a sensible proof of an abundant circulation in      his meaning was both to enrich and to people france marriages in the country were encouraged by an exemption from the taille during the space of five years for such as would settle themselves at the age of twenty and every father of a family who had ten children was exempted all his lifetime because he gave more to the state by the labor of these than he could possibly have done in paying the taille this regulation ought to have continued forever unrepealed from      till      each year of this ministry     was distinguished by the establishment of some manufacture or other the fine cloths which before had been brought from england and holland were manufactured in abbeville the king advanced to the manufacturer for each working loom two thousand livres besides considerable gratuities in      about fortyfour thousand two hundred woollen looms were reckoned to be in the kingdom the silk manufactures when brought to perfection produced a commerce of above fifty millions currency of that time and the advantage drawn from these was not only very much above the prime cost of the silk necessary in their manufacture but the cultivation of mulberry trees put the manufacturers into a condition of dispensing with foreign silk for the woof of their stuffs from the year      they began to make as fine glasses as at venice which city had always before furnished the whole consumption throughout europe and they soon made pieces of this kind which for largeness and beauty could never be imitated in any other place the carpets of turkey and persia were surpassed at savonnières the tapestry hangings from flanders were inferior to those of the gobelins which vast enclosure was filled at that time with more than eight hundred workmen and of these three hundred were lodged in it the best painters had the direction of the work either from their own designs or those of the ancient masters of italy besides the tapestry hangings was     made an admirable kind of mosaic and the art of inlaying was carried to its highest perfection besides this fine manufactory of tapestry in the gobelins another was set up at beauvais the first manufacturer had six hundred workmen in this town and the king made him a present of sixty thousand livres sixteen hundred young girls were employed in lace works and thirty principal workwomen in this way were brought from venice and two hundred out of flanders who had thirtysix thousand livres given them for their encouragement the manufactory of the cloths of sedan and that of the tapestry hangings of abusson degenerated and fallen into decay were reestablished the rich stuffs in which silk is mixed with gold and silver were woven at lyons and tours with an industry which had not been seen before it is a thing well known that the ministry purchased in england the secret of that ingenious machine by which stockings are made ten times faster than with needles tin plates steel fine delft ware and morocco leather which was always brought from abroad were made in france but the calvinists who had the secret of making tin plates and steel carried it away with them in      and imparted this advantage with several others to foreign nations the king every year expended about four hundred thousand livres upon the different works of     taste which were fabricated in his kingdom of which he made presents paris was then very different from what it is at present for it wanted light security and cleanliness it was necessary to make provision for the continual cleansing of the streets for lighting of them which is done by means of five thousand lamps burning every night for paving the city quite through building two new gates and repairing the old ones and causing a continual guard on foot and on horseback to keep watch for the security of the citizens the king took the whole upon himself allotting funds for these necessary expenses in      he created a magistrate solely for taking care of the police the greater part of the large cities of europe did not follow these examples till a long time after and none have equalled them so that no city is paved like paris and rome itself is not lighted at all everything began to have so great a tendency to perfection that the second lieutenant of police which paris had acquired in that post a reputation which set him in the rank of those who have done honor to this age such was the capacity of this man for everything he was afterward in the ministry and he had been a good general the place of lieutenant of the police was below his birth and merit yet it gained him a much greater name than the inconsiderable post in the ministry which he obtained near the end of his days     here we should observe that m dargenson was by no means the only person of the ancient nobility who had been in the public magistracy france is almost the only country of europe where the ancient nobility have often taken to the long robe all other nations merely from the remains of gothic barbarism are still ignorant that there is dignity in this profession the king still carried on the buildings at the louvre stgermain and versailles from      private individuals after his example erected in paris a thousand superb and commodious edifices of these the number was so increased that after the building of the environs of the palais royal and those of stsulpice there were formed in paris two new towns very much superior to the old one it was at this time that they invented the magnificent convenience of coaches adorned with glasses and hung upon springs so that a citizen of paris could convey himself through this large city with more pomp than the first romans displayed in their triumphal processions to the capitol this custom was soon after received throughout europe and being now very common it is no longer a piece of luxury  louis xiv had a taste for architecture gardening and sculpture and this showed itself in all these to be great and noble from the time that comptrollergeneral colbert had in      the direction of the buildings which is properly the office of   0 the arts he applied himself to second the schemes of his master the first necessary work was to finish the louvre francis mansard one of the greatest architects whom france had produced was fixed upon to construct the vast edifices that were projected he would not undertake this task unless he had liberty given him to rectify whatever should appear to him defective in the execution this diffidence of himself which had drawn a train of too much expense after it was the reason for excluding him the chevalier bernini was therefore sent for from rome an artist whose name was famous on account of the colonnade which surrounds the portal of st peters church the equestrian statue of constantine and the navonne fountain equipages     were furnished him for his journey he was conducted to paris as a man who came to do honor to france he received besides five louis dor a day for the eight months that he staid there a present of fifty thousand crowns with a pension of two thousand more and one of five hundred for his son this generosity of louis xiv to bernini was much greater than the munificence of francis i to raphael bernini by way of acknowledgment made since that time in rome the equestrain statue of the king which is to be seen at versailles but when he came to paris with so much parade as the only person worthy of being employed by louis xiv he was very much surprised to see the design of the front of the louvre on the side of stgermain lauxerrois which soon after when completed became one of the most august monuments of architecture in the world claude perrault had given this design which was executed by louis levau and dorbay he invented the machines with which the stones of fiftytwo feet in length were raised that form the pediment of this majestic edifice sometimes there is fetched from afar what is to be met with at hand among ourselves no palace of rome has an entrance comparable to that of the louvre for which we are indebted to this perrault  whom boileau     has attempted to render ridiculous travellers allow that the most celebrated villas of italy are not superior to the castle of maisons which francis mansard had built at so little expense bernini was magnificently recompensed but did not deserve it he only gave designs which were not executed the king when the works at the louvre were in progress the completion of which was so much desired when making a town at versailles near this palace which has cost so many millions when building trianon and marly and ordering so many other edifices to be embellished caused the observatory to be erected which was begun in      after the time that he established the academy of sciences but the most glorious monument for its utility grandeur and the difficulties encountered in the execution was the canal of languedoc which joins the two seas and falls into the port of cette constructed for the receiving of its waters these works were begun in      and continued without interruption till      the founding of the hôtel des invalides and the chapel of that structure the finest in paris the establishment of st cyr the last of so great a number of works constructed by this monarch are alone sufficient to render his name revered four thousand soldiers and a great number of officers who find in one of these grand     asylums comforts in their old age and relief for their wounds and wants two hundred and fifty daughters of noblemen who receive an education worthy of them in the other are so many voices that celebrate the praises of louis xiv the establishment of st cyr will be surpassed by that which louis xv has just formed for the education of five hundred gentlemen but far from causing st cyr to be forgotten it makes it to be remembered this is the art of doing good brought to perfection louis xiv was at the same time desirous to perform greater things and those of more general utility but more difficult in the execution and that was to reform the laws in this he employed the labors of the chancellor séguier de lamoignon talon bignon and more especially the chancellor of state pussort he himself sometimes assisted at their assemblies the year      was at the same time the epoch of his first laws and first conquests the civil ordinances appeared first next the code of the waters and forests then the statutes for all the manufactures the criminal ordinances the code of commerce and that of the marine all these followed nearly one year after another there was also a new jurisprudence established in favor of the negroes of our colonies a sort of men who had not yet enjoyed the privileges of humanity a profound knowledge of the civil law is not to be acquired by a sovereign but the king was acquainted with the principal laws he possessed the     spirit of them and knew how either to maintain or mitigate them properly he often decided the causes of his subjects not only in the council of the secretaries of state but in that called the conseil des parties there are two celebrated determinations of his in which he decided against himself in the first which was given in    0 the case was in a process between him and certain inhabitants of paris who had built upon his ground he decided that the houses should remain to them with the land belonging to himself and which he ceded to them the other related to a persian merchant called roupli whose goods had been seized by the commissaries of his farms in      his decision was that all should be restored to him and the king added a present of three thousand crowns roupli carried his admiration and gratitude with him into his own country and when mehemet rizabeg was afterward in paris we found him acquainted with this fact by common report the abolition of duels was one of the greatest services which he did to his country these combats had been formerly authorized even by the parliament and by the church and though they had been prohibited from the time of henry iv yet this fatal custom prevailed more than ever the famous combat of the la frettes four against four in      was that which determined louis xiv not     to pardon it any longer his happy severity corrected by degrees our own nation and even the neighboring nations who conformed themselves to our wise customs after having adopted our bad ones there are in europe now a hundred times fewer duels than in the time of louis xiii he was the legislator both of his people and of his armies it was strange that before his time uniforms among the troops was a thing not known it was he who in the first year of his administration ordered that each regiment should be distinguished either by the color of their clothes or by different marks a regulation which was adopted soon after by all nations it was he also who instituted brigadiers and put the corps of which the household troops of the king are formed upon the footing they are on at present he formed a company of musketeers out of the guards of cardinal mazarin and fixed at five hundred men the number of the two companies to which he gave the clothing they still retain under him were made no constables and after the death of the duke dépernon no colonelsgeneral of the infantry marshal gramont who was only campmaster of the french guards under the duke dépernon and took orders from that colonelgeneral for the future took them only from the king and was the first who had the title of colonel of the guards he himself installed these colonels at the heads of their regiments by giving them with his     own hands a gilt gorget and pike and afterward a spontoon or a kind of half pike when the use of the former weapon was abolished he instituted the grenadiers at first to the number of four in each company of the kings regiment which is of his own creation afterward he formed a company of grenadiers in each regiment of foot he gave two companies of them to the french guards which at present have three he very much augmented the corps of dragoons and gave them a colonelgeneral we must not forget the establishment of studs for breeding of horses in      which had been absolutely set aside before that time and was afterward a great resource for remounting the cavalry the use of the bayonet at the end of the gun is an institution of the kings before his time it was used occasionally and some companies only had this weapon there was no uniform usage nor exercise with it all was left to the generals discretion the pike was looked upon as the most formidable weapon the first regiment which had bayonets and was trained to this exercise was that of the fusiliers established in      the manner in which the artillery is managed at present is entirely owing to him he founded schools for this purpose at douai afterward at metz and strasburg and the regiment of artillery was at length filled with officers almost all capable of conducting a siege all the magazines of the kingdom were stored and every year furnished with     eight hundred thousand weight of powder he formed a regiment of bombardiers and one of hussars a kind of horsemen which before his time were known only among our enemies in      he established thirty regiments of militia furnished and equipped by the communities of the kingdom these corps of militia exercised themselves in war without neglecting the cultivation of the lands companies of cadets were entertained in most parts of the frontiers there they learned mathematics designing and all the exercises and did also the duty of soldiers this institution lasted ten years at length they were tired of these youths as it was too difficult a matter to discipline them but the corps of engineers which the king formed and to which he gave the regulations still followed by them is an establishment that will last forever under him the art of fortification was carried to perfection by marshal de vauban  and his pupils who surpased count de pagan he constructed or repaired a hundred and fifty fortified places in order to maintain the military discipline he created inspectorsgeneral afterward directors who gave an account of the state of the troops and     from their reports it was seen whether or not the commissaries of war had done their duty he instituted the order of st louis an honorable recompense often courted more than fortune the hôtel des invalides crowned the cares which he took for meriting to be well served it was owing to such cares as these that from      he had a hundred and eighty thousand regular troops and that by augmenting his forces in proportion as the number and power of his enemies increased he had at length four hundred and fifty thousand men in arms including the troops of the marine before his time no such strong armies had been seen his enemies hardly opposed to him any of equal force though there was a necessity for a close union among them he showed what france alone could do and he had always either great success or great resources he was the first who in time of peace gave a perfect idea and complete lesson of war in      he assembled at compiègne seventy thousand men where he performed all the operations of a campaign and this was in order to instruct his three grandsons but this military academy became a school of luxury the attention which he showed in forming numerous and welldisciplined armies even before he was engaged in any war he likewise exerted in acquiring the empire of the sea first the few vessels     which cardinal mazarin had suffered to rot in the harbors were repaired some others were bought in holland and sweden and after the third year of his government he sent his maritime forces to make an attempt on the coast of africa the duke de beaufort cleared the sea of pirates in      and two years after france had in its ports sixty ships of war this was only a beginning but while new regulations and new efforts were being made he already felt all his force he was unwilling to consent that his ships should strike their flag to that of england the council of king charles ii in vain insisted upon this right which force industry and time had given to the english louis xiv wrote to count destrades his ambassador the king of england and his chancellor may see what my forces are but they do not see my heart i regard my honor more than all other things he said no more than what he was resolved to maintain and in fact the usurpation of the english gave way to natural right and the firmness of louis xiv everything was equal between these two nations at sea but while he would have an equality kept up with england he maintained his superiority over spain he obliged the spanish admirals to strike to his flag in virtue of the solemn precedence agreed upon in      pains however were used on all sides for the establishment of a marine capable of justifying those   0 high sentiments the town and port of rochefort were built at the mouth of the charente sailors were enrolled and ranked by classes who were to serve at one time in merchant ships and at another in the royal navy and soon there were found to be sixty thousand of these actually registered councils of construction were established in the ports for giving vessels the most commodious form five marine arsenals were built at brest rochefort toulon dunkirk and havredegrâce in      there were sixty ships of the line and forty frigates in      a hundred and eighty ships of war including the tenders and thirty galleys were in the harbor of toulon either equipped or ready to be so eleven thousand regular troops served on board the ships and the galleys had three thousand there were a hundred and sixtysix thousand men registered by classes for all the different services of the marine the following years there were reckoned to be in the service a thousand gentlemen doing the duty of soldiers on board the ships and learning in the ports whatever might qualify them for the art of navigation and the working of a ship these were the marine guards they were on sea what the cadets were on land and were instituted in      but in small numbers this corps has been the school which has produced the best officers of the service of the navy there had not been yet marshals of france in the corps of the marine and this shows how this     essential part of the forces of france had been neglected john destrées was the first marshal in      it appears that one of the great objects of louis xiv was to inspire all ranks with that emulation without which everything languishes in all the naval fights in which the french fleets were engaged the advantage was always on their side till the battle of la hogue in      when count de tourville following the orders of the court attacked with fortyfour sail a fleet of ninety english and dutch ships there was no standing against numbers fourteen capital ships of the first rate were lost which being run aground were burned lest they should fall into the hands of the enemy notwithstanding this defeat the maritime forces supported themselves but they declined in the following war they did not begin to be well reestablished till      during a happy peace the only proper time for establishing a good marine for the accomplishment of which there is neither leisure nor power while a war lasts these naval forces were of use to protect commerce the colonies of martinique santo domingo and canada before in a languishing condition now flourished not indeed to such a height of prosperity as we see them now arrived at but with an advantage which till then had not been hoped for for from      till      these colonies had been a positive burden to the state in      the king sent a colony to cayenne and     soon after another to madagascar he tried all methods for repairing the loss and misfortune which france had suffered for a long time by neglecting the sea while her neighbors had erected empires for themselves at the extremities of the earth from this general view we see what changes louis xiv introduced into the state changes indeed advantageous as they still exist his ministers had an emulation among themselves who should second him best the whole detail the whole execution is undoubtedly owing to them but the general disposition to him it is certain that the magistrates would not have reformed the laws the finances would not have been put again in order discipline introduced into the armies general police in the kingdom that there would have been no fleets the arts would not have been encouraged and all this in concert and at the same time with perseverance and under different ministers if there had not been found a master who had in general all these grand views with a will determined to accomplish them he did not separate his own glory from the advantage of france nor look upon the kingdom with the same eye as a lord does upon his lands from which he draws all he can that he may live luxuriously every king who loves glory loves the public good he had no longer colbert and louvois when in      he ordered with a view to the instruction of the duke of burgundy that each intendant     should give a circumstantial description of his respective province by which means an exact account might be obtained of the kingdom and the true number of its inhabitants ascertained the work was useful though all the intendants had not the capacity and attention of m lamoignon de bâville had the views of the king been so fully answered with regard to each province as they had been by this magistrate in the enumeration of the people of languedoc this collection of memoirs would have been one of the finest monuments of the age some of them are well done but a plan was wanting by which all the intendants were to be subjected to the same order it had been a thing much to be desired that each had given in columns a state of the number of inhabitants in every province also that of the nobles citizens laborers artificers works of art the beasts of every sort the good middling and bad lands the whole clergy regular and secular their revenues with those of the towns and companies all these objects are confounded in the greatest part of the memoirs which have been given the matters in them are not canvassed thoroughly and are done with little exactness you are often obliged to seek with pains for the necessary lights which a minister should find ready under his hand and catch up by a single glance that he may easily discover the several forces wants and resources contained therein the project was excellent and     a uniform execution of it would have been of the greatest utility this then in general is what louis xiv did and attempted that he might render his own nation more flourishing it seems to me that one cannot behold all these labors and all these efforts without some acknowledgment and being animated with the love of the public good which inspired them let us but represent to ourselves what the state of the kingdom was in the days of the fronde and what it is at present louis xiv did more good to his own nation than twenty of his predecessors put together and yet it falls infinitely short of what might have been done the war which was ended by the peace of ryswick began the ruin of that commerce which colbert had established and the succeeding war completed it had he employed for the embellishing of paris and the completion of the louvre those immense sums expended on the aqueducts and the works of maintenon for conveying water to versailles works indeed interrupted and useless had he laid out in paris the fifth part of what that cost in order to force nature at versailles paris would be throughout its whole extent as beautiful as it is on the side of the tuileries and the pontroyal and would have been the most magnificent city in the world it is a great deal to have reformed the laws but chicanery could not be crushed by justice the government once thought of making jurisprudence     uniform it is so already in criminal affairs in those of commerce and the forms of process it might be so likewise in the laws which regulate the fortunes of the subject it is a great inconvenience that the same tribunal has more than a hundred different customs to give decisions upon the duties arising from lands either equivocal or burdensome to society still continue as the remains of the feudal government which itself subsists no longer these are the remains of a gothic building now no more it is not pretended these different orders of the state should be subjected to the same law for one is very sensible that the usages of the noblesse the clergy the magistrates and those who cultivate the earth should be different but it is undoubtedly to be wished for that each order should have its uniform law throughout the kingdom that what is just and true in champagne may not be considered false in normandy uniformity in all sorts of administration is a virtue but the difficulties of this great work have deterred people from attempting it louis xiv might have more easily dispensed with the dangerous resource of the farmers of the taxes to which he was compelled by the constant anticipation of the receipt of his revenues as may be seen in the chapter of the finances had he not believed that he was sufficiently able merely by his own authority to oblige a million of men to change their religion france had not lost     so many subjects this country however notwithstanding its various shocks and losses is at present the most flourishing on the face of the earth because all the good which louis xiv did is still in existence and the evil which it was difficult for him to avoid in turbulent times has been repaired in fine posterity who pass judgment on kings and whose judgment they should always have before their eyes will admit on weighing the virtues and foibles of this monarch that though he had been too much praised in his lifetime he deserved to be so forever and that he was worthy of the statue erected to him at montpellier with the inscription to louis the great after his death all the changes which we have just now seen pointed out in the government and in all the orders of the state must necessarily have produced a very considerable one in the manners of the people the spirit of faction fury and rebellion which possessed the nation from the time of francis ii became a spirit of emulation for serving the prince the lords who possessed great estates being no longer cantoned upon them the governors of provinces having no more posts of honor to bestow each individual studied to deserve no other favors than those of the sovereign and the state became one regular whole every line of which terminated in the centre this was what delivered the court from factions and conspiracies which had always troubled the     state during a course of so many years under the administration of louis xiv there was but one plot in      which was contrived by la traumont a gentleman of normandy ruined by debauchery and debt he was joined by one of the house of rohan who by like conduct had been reduced to the same indigent circumstances in this plot were concerned only the chevalier de preaux nephew of la traumont who seduced by his uncle also seduced his mistress madame de villiers their aim and hopes neither were nor could be to form a party in the kingdom they only intended to sell and deliver up quillebeuf to the dutch and introduce the enemy into normandy this was a base treason ill planned rather than a conspiracy the punishment of all the criminals was the only event which this mad and fruitless affair produced of which there is hardly at present any remembrance left if there were any seditions in the provinces these were only feeble tumults of the people which were easily repressed even the huguenots were always quiet till their churches were demolished at length the king succeeded so far as to make out of a nation till then turbulent a peaceable people who were dangerous only to the enemy after having been so to themselves for above a hundred years their manners were softened without hurting their courage in the houses which the nobility built or bought in paris their ladies lived with dignity and formed     schools of politeness which drew by degrees the young people from a life spent at the taverns which had been the prevailing mode for a long time before and only served to inspire those who frequented them with an insolent debauchery manners depend on such trifles that the custom of riding on horseback in paris kept up a disposition for quarrels which ceased as soon as this usage was abolished decorum for which we are principally obliged to the fair sex who assembled company at their houses rendered conversation more agreeable and by reading came in time to be more solid treasons and great crimes which do not disgrace mankind in times of faction and confusion were hardly known any longer the villainies of brinvilliers and voisin were only transitory storms under a sky otherwise serene and it would be equally unreasonable to condemn a whole nation on account of the glaring crimes of some individuals as to canonize it on account of the reformation of la trappe all the different states of life were in former times easily known by the faults which characterized them those of a military turn and the young people who designed themselves for the profession of arms had a hasty vivacity those belonging to the courts of justice a stern forbidding gravity to which the custom of going always in a long robe even to court did not a little contribute and it was the same case with regard to the universities and to physicians merchants still wore little robes     whenever they met together and when they went to wait on the ministers also the most considerable tradesmen were at that time persons of rustic manners but the houses the theatres and the public walks in which they began to meet together in order to enjoy the pleasure of a social life gradually rendered the exterior appearance of all these people nearly alike one may see at this day even in tradesmens shops that politeness has gained ground upon all ranks the provinces have in time also felt the effects of these changes at length people no longer place luxury in anything but taste and convenience the crowd of pages and servants in livery has disappeared to make way for more freedom in the houses of the great vain pomp and outward pride have been left to those nations among whom the people still know no more than to show themselves in public and who are ignorant of the art of living the extreme easiness introduced into the intercourse of the world affability simplicity and the cultivation of the mind have rendered paris a city which for the conveniences of life enjoyed there probably very much surpasses rome and athens in the height of their splendor that great number of helps always ready always open for the whole circle of the sciences all the arts particular tastes and wants so many solid advantages uniting with such a number of agreeable things joined to that openness peculiar to the inhabitants   0 of paris all these together induce vast numbers of strangers to travel or take up their residence in this social city if some natives quit it they are either such as being called elsewhere on account of their talents are an honorable testimony to their country or else the refuse of the nation who try to make their advantage of the consideration it has acquired complaints are made that no longer is to be seen at court so much grandeur and dignity as formerly the truth is that there are no petty tyrants as in the days of the fronde under the reign of louis xiii and in the preceding ages but true greatness is now to be met with in those crowds of nobility who were formerly debased for so long a time by serving subjects grown too powerful there are seen gentlemen and also citizens who would have thought themselves honored in former days to be the domestics of these lords become now their equals and very often their superiors in the military service and the more this service prevails over titles the more flourishing is any state the age of louis xiv has been compared to that of augustus not that the power and personal events in both can be compared for rome and augustus were ten times more considerable in the world than louis xiv and paris but we must call to mind that athens was equal to the roman empire in all things which do not derive their value from force and power we must further consider     that if there is nothing at present in the world like ancient rome and augustus yet all europe together is much superior to the whole roman empire in the time of augustus there was but one nation and at this day there are several who are well regulated warlike and enlightened who are possessed of arts to which the greeks and romans were utter strangers and among these nations there are none which has been more illustrious for about an age past than that formed in some measure by louis xiv chapter xxviii finance under louis xiv if we compare the administration of colbert with all the preceding ones posterity will be fond of this man whose body the frantic populace after his death would have torn to pieces the french certainly owe to him their industry and their commerce and consequently that wealth the sources of which are sometimes diminished in war but are always opened again with an abundant flow in peace yet in   0  people had still the ingratitude to throw the blame upon colbert for the languor which began to be perceivable in the sinews of the state a financier of normandy published about that time an account of the revenues of france in two small volumes in which he pretended that everything was in a declining state from    0 but so far from this being the case it was quite the reverse france had     never been so flourishing as since the death of cardinal mazarin down to the war of      and even in that war the body of the state though beginning to be out of order supported itself by means of the vigor which colbert had diffused through all its members the author of this detail pretended that from    0 the lands of the kingdom had diminished in value fifteen hundred millions but nothing was more false nor less probable these captious arguments however persuaded such as would be persuaded to believe this ridiculous paradox it was easier in france than in any other country to decry the ministry of the finances in the minds of the people this ministry is the most odious because the imposts are always so besides there prevailed in general as much prejudice and ignorance in the finances as there did in philosophy it was so long before people received better information that even in our days we find in      the parliament in a body telling the duke of orleans that the intrinsic value of the silver mark is twentyfive livres as if there was any other real intrinsic value than that of the weight and the fineness and the duke of orleans with all his penetration in other respects had not enough of it in this to remove that mistake of the parliament it is true colbert had not done all that he could and still less than he would have done men were not then sufficiently enlightened and in a great kingdom there are always great abuses the arbitrary     taille the multiplicity of duties the different customs of the provinces which make one part of the inhabitants of france strangers and even enemies to the other the little resemblance there is between the measures of one town and those of another with twenty other maladies of the body politic could not be remedied colbert in order to furnish at once the expense of the war of buildings and pleasures was obliged to reestablish in      what at first he intended to have abolished forever namely imposts on places rents new offices and the augmentation of salaries in short that which supports the state for some time but involves it in debt for many years he was carried beyond his intended measures for by all the instructions remaining of his we see he was persuaded that the riches of a country consist only in the number of its inhabitants the cultivation of the lands the industry of the people and commerce we see that the king possessing very few domains and being only the administrator of the goods of his subjects cannot indeed be rich but by imposts easy to bear and equally assessed he feared so much to give up the state to the farmers of the kings revenue that some time after the dissolution of the chamber of justice which he had caused to be erected against them he got an arret of council passed which made it death for those who should advance money upon the new imposts his meaning by this menacing arret which     was never printed was to cure the avidity of undertakers but soon after he was obliged to make use of them without even revoking the arret for the king was pressing and it was necessary to find prompt means to satisfy him this invention brought from italy into france by catherine de medici had so much corrupted the government by the facility with which it procured supplies that after having been suppressed in the glorious days of henry iv it appeared again throughout the reign of louis xiii and greatly infected the latter times of louis xiv six years after the death of colbert in      france was precipitated into a war which she was obliged to maintain against all europe without having any funds in reserve the minister lepelletier believed that it would be sufficient to diminish luxury an ordinance was accordingly made that all the movables of solid plate which were to be seen at that time in considerable quantities in the houses of the great and were a proof of opulence should be carried to the mint the king set the example he parted with all those silver tables branched chandeliers grand canopycouches of massive silver and all the other movables which were masterpieces chased by the hand of ballin the greatest artist in his way and all done from designs of lebrun they had cost ten millions but produced only three the wrought plate belonging to private     persons yielded three millions more the resource was inconsiderable in      and      the finances of the state appeared sensibly out of order those who attributed the diminution of the public revenue to the profusion of louis xiv on his buildings the arts and his pleasures were not aware that on the contrary the expenses which encourage industry enrich a state it is war that necessarily impoverishes the public treasury unless the spoils of the vanquished can fill it again since the time of the ancient romans i know of no nation that has enriched itself by victories italy in the sixteenth century was rich only by commerce holland would not have existed long had she confined herself to the taking of the platefleet of the spaniards and were not the east indies the support of her power england has always impoverished herself by war even in destroying the french fleets and commerce alone has maintained her the algerines who have hardly any more than what they gain by piracy are most miserably poor among the nations of europe war at the end of some years renders the conqueror nearly as unhappy as the conquered it is a gulf in which all the streams of abundance are absorbed ready money that principle of all good and of all evil raised with such difficulty in the provinces terminates in the coffers of a hundred stockjobbers and farmers of the revenue who advance the sums     wanting by the state and who buy by virtue of these advances the right of pillaging the nation in the name of the sovereign the people in consequence of this looking on the government as their enemy conceal their wealth and the want of circulation brings a languor on the kingdom no sudden remedy can supply a fixed and permanent establishment of long standing which provides at a distance against any unforeseen wants the capitation  was established in      it was suppressed at the peace of ryswick and reestablished later comptrollergeneral de pontchartrain sold patents of nobility for two thousand crowns in      five hundred persons bought them but the resource was transitory and the shame permanent the nobles both ancient and modern were obliged to register their coats of arms and to pay for the permission of sealing their letters with them the farmers bargained for this tax and advanced the money so that the ministry had hardly ever recourse to any but petty resources in a country which could have furnished much greater they dared not impose the tenth penny till    0 but this tenth penny raised after so many other     burdensome taxes appeared so hard that they dared not exact it with rigor the government did not draw from it twentyfive millions a year at forty francs to the mark colbert had made few attempts to change the nominal value of money but it is better not to change it at all silver and gold those standards of exchange should be invariable he raised the nominal value of the silver mark which was twentysix francs in his time only to twentyseven and twentyeight and after his death in the last years of louis xiv this denomination was extended as far as forty imaginary livres a fatal resource by which the king was relieved for a moment in order to be ruined afterward for instead of a silver mark he had only given him little more than the half of it he who owed twentysix livres in      gave a mark and he who owed forty livres gave little more than this same mark in    0 the diminutions which followed disconcerted the little commerce that remained as much as raising it had done a real resource might have been found in paper credit but this should be established in a time of prosperity that it may maintain itself in times that are otherwise the minister chamillard began in   0  to pay in bank notes notes of subsistence and free quarters but as this paper money was not received into the kings coffers it was destroyed almost as soon as     it appeared the government was reduced to the necessity of continuing to negotiate heavy loans and use by anticipation four years of the revenues of the crown we are told in the history written by la hode and put under the name of de la martinière that it cost seventytwo per cent for exchange in the wars of italy which is an absurdity the matter of fact is this that m chamillard in order to pay the armies made use of the credit of the chevalier bernard this minister believed through an old prejudice that money must not go out of the kingdom as if such money were given for nothing and as if it were possible that one nation indebted to another and which does not discharge itself by mercantile effects should not pay in ready money this minister gave the banker eight per cent of the profits upon condition that foreigners were paid without making the money go out of france besides this he paid the exchange which amounted to five or six per cent loss yet the banker notwithstanding his promise was obliged to pay his accounts with the foreigners in money and this produced a considerable loss comptrollergeneral desmarets nephew of the celebrated colbert having succeeded chamillard in   0  could not cure an evil which everything rendered incurable nature conspired with fortune to distress the state the severe winter of   0  obliged the king     to remit to the people nine millions of taxes at the time when he had not wherewithal to pay his soldiers the scarcity of provisions was so excessive that it cost fortyfive millions for provisions for the army and the kings ordinary revenue produced scarcely fortynine the expenses of   0  amounted to two hundred and twentyone millions there was then a necessity for ruining the state that the enemy might not make themselves masters of it the disorder grew to such a head and was so little repaired that for a long time after the peace at the beginning of      the king was obliged to cause thirtytwo millions of notes to be negotiated in order to have eight millions in specie in short at his death he left a debt of two thousand six hundred millions reckoning twentyeight livres to the mark the rate to which the coin was then reduced and this makes about four thousand five hundred millions of our current money in    0 it is astonishing but true that this immense debt would not have been a burden impossible to bear had there been at that time a flourishing commerce in france a paper credit established and substantial companies which would have answered this credit as is the case in sweden england venice and holland for when a powerful state is indebted only within itself credit and circulation are sufficient to make payments but a great deal was wanting for france to have at that time a sufficient number of springs to operate so vast   0 and complicated a machine the weight of which crushed it louis xiv in his reign expended eighteen thousand millions which amounts one year with another to three hundred and thirty millions of the present currency by compensating interchangeably with each other the nominal raisings and lowerings of the coin under the administration of the great colbert the ordinary revenues of the crown rose only to a hundred and seventeen millions at twentyseven livres and afterward twentyeight livres to the silver mark thus the whole surplus was always furnished by extraordinary methods colbert was obliged for example to raise four hundred millions in six years in the war of      the king had but very few ancient domains of the crown left these were declared unalienable by all the parliaments of the kingdom and yet almost all of them were alienated the kings revenue consisted of the wealth of his subjects and was a perpetual circulation of debts and payments his majesty owed the people more nominal millions a year under the name of annuities of the town house than any king ever drew from the domains of the crown in order to form an idea of this prodigious increase of taxes debts riches circulation and at the same time of the embarrassments and trouble which have been experienced in france and other countries it is to be considered that at the death of     francis i the state owed about thirty millions of livres to the town house and that at present it owes over fortyfive millions a year those who have compared the revenues of louis xiv with those of louis xv have found by only keeping to the fixed and current revenue that louis xiv was much richer in      at the time of colberts death with a hundred and seventeen millions of revenue than his successor was in    0 with nearly two hundred millions and this will appear by considering only the fixed and ordinary revenues of the crown for a hundred and seventeen nominal millions with the mark at twentyeight livres is a much greater sum than two hundred millions at fortynine livres which was the amount of the kings revenue in    0 and moreover we must reckon the charges increased by the loans of the crown but the revenues of the king that is of the state have since been accumulated and the knowledge of the finances has been brought to such a state of perfection that in the ruinous war of      there was no stagnation of credit we have begun to form funds of mortgages as among the english it was necessary to adopt a part of their system of finances as we have done of their philosophy and if in a state purely monarchial these circulating notes could be introduced which at least double the wealth of england the administration of france would acquire its last degree of perfection      in      there were about five hundred nominal millions of silver coin in the kingdom and about twelve hundred of the present currency but the denomination in our days is almost double what it was in colberts time it therefore appears that france is only about onesixth part richer in circulating specie since the death of that minister it is much more so in materials of silver and gold worked and used for service and luxury in    0 it had not four hundred millions of our perfect coin and at this day we have as much as there is circulating specie nothing shows more plainly how commerce the sources of which colbert opened has been increased when a free course has been given to its channels that were shut close by the wars industry has been brought to perfection notwithstanding the emigration of so many artists which the revoking of the edict of nantes has dispersed and this industry still increases daily the nation is capable of as great things and even still greater than it was under louis xiv because genius and commerce always gain new strength wherever they are encouraged to see the affluence of individuals the number of agreeable houses built in paris and in the provinces the multitude of equipages the conveniences and     refinements of luxury you would think that our opulence is twenty times greater than it was formerly all this is the fruit of ingenious labor rather than of riches at this day it costs but little more for an agreeable lodging than it did for a bad one in the reign of henry iv a beautiful sort of glass of our own manufacture adorns our houses at much less expense than the little glasses which were brought from venice our fine and showy stuffs are cheaper than those which we brought from foreign countries and which were not of equal value with them in effect it is not silver and gold that procure a commodious life but genius a people possessed only of these metals would be miserable whereas on the other hand a people without these metals but who can happily employ all the productions of the earth would be the truly wealthy people france has this advantage with a great deal more specie than is necessary for circulation industry being brought to perfection in the towns grew up and increased in the country there will always be complaints raised about the condition of the tillers of the soil you hear them in all countries of the world and such murmurings are generally produced from indolent people of fortune who condemn the government more than they bemoan the people it is true that in almost every country if such as pass their days in rural labors had leisure to murmur they would rise up against     the exactions which take from them a part of their substance they would detest the necessity of paying such taxes as they had not laid upon themselves and of bearing the burden of the state without participating in the advantages enjoyed by other citizens it does not belong to the province of history to examine how the people may be taxed without being oppressed and to mark the precise point so difficult to be fixed between the execution of the laws and the abuse of them between impost and rapine but history should show that it is impossible for a town to be flourishing unless the country round it enjoys plenty for certainly the produce of its fields supports its inhabitants we hear on particular days in all the towns of france the reproaches of those who by their profession are allowed to declaim in public against all the different branches of consumption to which the name of luxury is given it is evident that the nourishment for this luxury is furnished only by the industrious labor of the tillers of the ground a labor which is always dearly paid for more vineyards have been planted and better cultivated new wines have been made that were not known before like those of champagne the makers of which have been well acquainted with the methods of giving them the color flavor and strength of the burgundy wines and which they vend among foreigners to a great advantage this increase of wines has produced that of brandies     the cultivation of gardens of pulse and fruit has received a prodigious improvement and the commerce in provisions with the colonies of america has from this been augmented the loud complaints which have been made in all times about the misery of the country have now ceased to have any foundation besides in these vague complaints there is no distinction made between the planters the farmers and the mechanics these last live only by the labor of their hands and the case is alike in all the countries of the world where the bulk of the people or the greater number should subsist by that means but there is scarcely a kingdom in the universe in which the planter and the farmer are more at ease than in france and england alone may dispute this advantage with it the proportional landtax instead of that substituted at discretion has still contributed for about thirty years past to render more stable the fortunes of such husbandmen as have ploughs vineyards and gardens the craftsman or workman must be restricted to necessaries for labor such is the nature of man for though the greater part of mankind may be poor there is no necessity for their being miserable the middling sort have enriched themselves by industry the ministers and the courtiers are less wealthy because money having been raised nominally about half its value their appointments and pensions have continued the same and the price     of goods has risen more than half this is what has happened in all the countries of europe the several dues and fees have everywhere remained on the ancient footing an elector of the empire who receives the investiture of his states pays no more than what his predecessors paid in the time of the emperor charles iv in the fourteenth century and in this ceremony there is only a crown due to the emperors secretary what is much stranger is that though all things have been raised the nominal value of coin the quantity of materials in gold and silver and the price of merchant goods yet the pay of a soldier has continued at the same rate as it was two hundred years ago a foot soldier has five nominal sous the same as he had in the time of henry iv none among the great number of ignorant men who sell their lives at so cheap a rate know that since the overrating of the specie and the dearness of merchandise he receives about twothirds less than the soldiers of henry iv did if he knew it and demanded a pay twothirds greater it must have been granted him hence it must happen that as the powers of europe would keep on foot twothirds fewer troops their forces would be balanced in the same proportion the cultivation of the ground and the manufactures would profit by this measure we must further observe that the profits of commerce being augmented and the appointments for     all the great offices diminished in their real value there is found to be less wealth among the great than formerly and more among the middling rank of people and this circumstance has put men more upon a level in former days there was no resource for the little but to serve the great at present industry has opened a thousand ways which were not known a hundred years ago in short in whatever manner the finances of the state may be administered france possesses in the labor of twenty millions of inhabitants an inestimable treasure chapter xxix progress of the sciences this happy age which has seen a revolution produced in the human mind did not seem destined to it to begin with philosophy there was no appearance in the time of louis xiv that it would have emerged out of the chaos into which it was plunged the inquisition of italy spain and portugal had linked the errors of philosophy to the tenets of religion the civil wars in france and the disputes of calvinism were not more adapted to cultivate human reason than was the fanaticism of cromwells time in england though a canon thorn renewed the ancient planetary system of the chaldæans which had been exploded for so long a time this truth was condemned at rome and the congregation of the holy office composed of     seven cardinals having declared not only heretical but absurd the motion of the earth without which there is no true astronomy—the great galileo having asked pardon at the age of seventy for being in the right—there was no appearance that the truth would be received in the world chancellor bacon had shown but at a distance the track which might be followed galileo had made some discoveries on the descent of bodies torricelli began to ascertain the gravity of the air which surrounds us and some experiments had been made at magdeburg notwithstanding these essays all the schools continued in absurdity and the world in ignorance then appeared descartes he did the contrary of what should have been done instead of studying nature he wanted to guess at her he was the greatest geometrician of his age but geometry leaves the mind as she finds it that of descartes was too much addicted to invention the prince of mathematicians made scarcely any more than romances of philosophy a man who scorned experiments never cited galileo and was for building without materials could erect no more than an imaginary edifice that which was romantic in it succeeded and the few truths mixed with these new chimeras were at first contested but at last these few truths broke out by the help of the method which he himself introduced for before his time there was no thread for this labyrinth and at least he gave one of which     a use was made after he had bewildered himself it was a great deal to destroy the chimeras of peripateticism though by means of other chimeras these two phantoms combated each other they fell successively and reason raised itself at length upon their ruins there was at florence an academy for experiments under the name of del cimento established by cardinal leopold de medici about      they were already aware in this country of the arts that it was not possible to comprehend anything about the grand fabric of nature but by examining her minutely this academy after the days of galileo and from the time of torricelli performed signal services some philosophers in england under the gloomy administration of cromwell met together for the discovery of truth at a time when it was oppressed by the severity of enthusiasm charles ii being called home to the throne of his ancestors by the repentance and inconstancy of his own nation gave letters patent to this infant and rising academy but this was all that the government gave the royal society or rather the free society of london labored to promote useful knowledge it was from this illustrious body that in our days proceeded the discoveries on light the principle of gravitation the motion of the fixed stars and a hundred other discoveries which in that respect might give occasion to the calling of this age the age of the english as well as that of louis xiv   0 in      colbert jealous of this new kind of glory was desirous that the french should partake of it and at the entreaty of some learned men prevailed on louis xiv to condescend to the establishment of the academy of sciences it was free till      like that of england and the french academy colbert drew from italy dominico de cassini  and huygens from holland by means of large pensions they discovered the satellites and the ring of saturn the world is indebted to huygens for pendulum clocks by degrees knowledge was acquired in all parts of true physics by rejecting systems the public was surprised to see a chemistry in which researches were made neither for the grand secret nor for the art of prolonging life beyond the bounds of nature an astronomy which did not predict the events of the world and a medicine independent of the phases of the moon     putrefaction was no longer the parent of animals and plants there were no more prodigies from the time that nature came to be better known for she was studied in all her works geography received astonishing improvements no sooner had louis xiv built the observatory than he caused a degree of the meridian to be measured in      by dominico de cassini and picard which was continued toward the north in      by de lahire and at last cassini prolonged it in   00 as far as the extremity of roussillon this is the finest monument of astronomy and is sufficient to eternize this age in      natural philosophers were sent to cayenne in order to make useful observations this voyage gave rise to the discovery of a new law of nature which the great newton has demonstrated and has paved the way for those more famous voyages which have since given a lustre to the reign of louis xv in   00 de tournefort was sent to the levant to collect there the plants necessary to enrich the royal garden which was formerly neglected but was at that time restored and is now worthy of the curiosity of europe the royal library already well stocked was enriched under louis xiv with upward of thirty thousand volumes and this example is so well followed in our days that it contains at this time more than a hundred and eighty thousand he caused the law school which had been     shut for a hundred years past to be opened he established in all the universities of france professors of the french law one would imagine that there should be no other here and that the good roman laws incorporated with those of the country should form but one body of the laws of the nation under him literary journals were established it is well known that the journal des savans which began in      is the first of all the works of this kind with which europe is at this day filled and into which too many abuses have crept as commonly happens in things of the greatest utility the academy of the belleslettres composed at first in      of some members of the french academy for transmitting to posterity by medals the actions of louis xiv became useful to the public from the time that it was no longer solely employed about the monarch and that they applied themselves to researches into antiquity and a judicious criticism upon opinions and facts it produced nearly the same effect in history as the academy of sciences did in natural philosophy it dispelled errors the spirit of discernment and criticism which increased by degrees insensibly destroyed superstition it is to this dawn of reason that we owe the declaration of the king in      which forbids the tribunals to admit simple accusations of sorcery this was a matter which dared not be attempted under henry iv and louis xiii and if since          there have been accusations of enchantment the judges have not condemned the persons accused excepting where profanation of religion or the use of poison was proved against them  it was formerly very common to try sorcerers by plunging them in water being first bound with cords and if they floated on the surface they were convicted several judges in the provinces had ordered such trials to be made and these methods still continued for a long time among the people every shepherd was a sorcerer and amulets and studded rings were used in the towns the effects of the hazel wand with which it was believed that springs treasures and thieves could be found out were looked upon as certain and have still a great deal of credit given them in more than one province     in germany there was hardly anybody but who had his nativity cast and nothing was talked of but magical secrets all ranks were infected with the delusion learned men and magistrates had written seriously on these matters a set of authors was distinguished by the name of dæmonographi there were rules for discerning true magicians and true demoniacs from the false in fine even to our time there was hardly anything adopted from antiquity but errors of every kind superstitious notions were so rooted among men that people were frightened by a comet in    0 and scarcely anyone dared to combat this popular fear james bernoulli one of the greatest mathematicians in europe in his answer to those who maintained the ominous nature of comets says that its head cannot be a sign of the divine wrath because that head is eternal but that the tail may very well be so however neither the head nor tail are eternal it was then necessary that bayle should write against vulgar prejudices a book famous at that time which the progress since made by reason has now rendered useless one would not believe that sovereigns had obligations to philosophers it is however true that this philosophic spirit which has gained ground among all ranks except the lower class of people has very much contributed to give a due weight to the rights of princes disputes which would have formerly produced excommunications interdicts     and schisms have caused none of these things it has been said that the people would be happy had they philosophers for their kings it is equally true that kings are the more happy when many of their subjects are philosophers it must be allowed that the reasonable spirit which begins to preside over education in the large towns has not been able to cure the frenzy of the fanatics in the cévennes nor prevent the inferior people of paris showing their folly at the tomb of st médard  nor quiet the disputes as violent as they are frivolous which arise between men who ought to be wiser but before this age such disputes had caused troubles in europe the miracles of st médard were believed by the most considerable citizens and fanaticism which had been     confined within the mountains of the cévennes diffused itself into the towns science and literature seemed carried to perfection in this age and so many writers have extended the powers of the human understanding that those who at other times would have been thought prodigies passed undistinguished in the crowd their glory is lessened on account of their number but the glory of the age is greatly exalted chapter xxx the polite arts in europe at the time of louis xiv i have sufficiently hinted in the course of this history that the public disasters it contains which succeed one another almost without intermission are at length erased from the registers of time the springs and minute circumstances of politics sink into oblivion while wise laws and institutions the monuments produced by the arts and sciences continue forever of the immense crowd of strangers that now travel to rome not as pilgrims but as persons of taste hardly one takes pains to inquire anything concerning gregory vii or boniface viii they admire the beautiful churches built by a bramantes and a michelangelo the paintings of a raphael and the sculptures of a bernini if they have genius they read the works of ariosto and tasso and reverence     the ashes of galileo in england the exploits of cromwell are scarcely mentioned and the disputes of the white and red roses are almost forgotten but newton is studied for whole years together no one is surprised to see in his epitaph that he was the glory of mankind but it would be a matter of great wonder in that country to see the remains of any statesman honored with such a title i should be glad in this place to do justice to all the great men who like him were the ornaments of their country in the last century i have called this the age of louis xiv not only because this monarch patronized the arts much more than all the other kings his contemporaries put together but also because he saw all the generations of the princes of europe thrice renewed i have fixed this epoch some years before the time of louis xiv and have carried it down some years after his decease as this was in fact the space of time in which the human mind made the greatest progress the english have made greater advances toward perfection in almost every species of learning from    0 till the present time than in all the preceding ages i shall not here repeat what i have elsewhere said of milton it is true he is accused by several critics of a whimsical extravagance in his description such as that of the fools paradise the walls of alabaster with which the garden of eden was surrounded the devils who transformed themselves     from giants to pygmies to take up less room in the council chamber of hell built all of pure gold the firing of cannon in heaven the hills that the combatants flung at one anothers heads angels on horseback and angels whose bodies after being cut asunder unite again he is complained of for his prolixity and incessant repetitions they say he equals neither ovid nor hesiod in that long description of the formation of the earth animals and man his dissertations on astronomy are censured as being too dry and uninteresting his invention is thought rather extravagant than wonderful and more disgusting than striking for instance the long causeway over chaos sin and death enamored of each other and having children by their incestuous commerce death who lifts up his nose to snuff through the immensity of chaos the change which has befallen the earth as a raven smells dead carcasses the same death who smells out sin who strikes with his petrifying club on the elements of earth and water which together with heat and humidity become four valiant generals of an army leading in battlearray the lightarmed embryos of atoms  in short writers have exhausted themselves in criticisms on this celebrated work but there can be no end to the     praises it merits milton will ever continue the boast and admiration of the english nation will always be compared to homer whose faults are equally great and always preferred to dante whose imagination is even more extravagant among the great number of pleasing poets that adorned the reign of charles ii such as waller the earls of dorset and roscommon the duke of buckingham etc the celebrated dryden holds a distinguished place he is equally famous in all the different kinds of poetry his writings abound with a number of minute particulars at once natural and lively animated bold nervous and pathetic a merit in which he has been equalled by no other poet of his nation nor exceeded by anyone among the ancients if pope who came after him had not in the latter part of his life written his essay on man he would have fallen far short of dryden no nation has ever treated morality in verse with so much energy and depth as the english in this i think seems to lie the greatest merit of their poets there is another kind of varied literature which requires a still more cultivated and universal genius this addison possessed in an eminent degree he has not only immortalized his name by his cato which is the only english tragedy written with elegance and wellsupported dignity but his other writings both moral and critical breathe the very soul of good taste here sense is   0 everywhere embellished with the flowers of imagination and his manner of writing may serve as a model to all nations there are several little pieces of dean swift unmatched by anything of the kind in antiquity he is rabelais improved the english are not acquainted with funeral orations it not being the custom with them to praise their kings and queens in their churches but pulpit eloquence which before the reign of charles ii was very rude became formed on a sudden bishop burnet acknowledges that this was owing to their imitation of the french perhaps they have even surpassed their masters they are not so stiff affected and declamatory in their sermons as the french are it is also remarkable that these islanders who are separated from the rest of the world and who remained so long untaught should have acquired at least as much knowledge of antiquity as is to be met with in rome though the centre of all nations masham has unveiled the dark accounts of ancient egypt no persian had ever a more perfect knowledge of the religion of zoroaster than the celebrated hyde the history of mahomet and the times preceding him which was unknown to the turks has been fully illustrated by hales who made so many useful voyages to arabia there is no country in the world where the christian religion has been so strongly attacked and so learnedly defended as in england from the time b     of henry viii to that of cromwell they carried on their disputes like the ancient gladiators who were wont to come into the arena to fight with scimitars in their hands and bandages about their eyes some slight differences in doctrine and worship were productive of the most bloody wars whereas from the restoration to the present time though scarcely a year has passed without some attack on christianity the controversy has not excited the least disturbance learning being the only weapon now employed on either side instead of fire and sword as formerly  but it is in philosophy that the english have particularly had the mastery over all other nations ingenious and speculative notions were out of the question the fables of the greeks had been long laid aside and those of the moderns were to appear no more chancellor bacon first led the way by asserting that we should search into nature in a new manner and have recourse to experiments boyle employed his whole life in making them this is no place for discussions on natural philosophy let it suffice to say that after three thousand years of vain inquiries newton was the first who discovered and demonstrated the great law of nature by which every part of matter tends toward the centre and all the planets are retained in their proper course he was the first who truly beheld light before him we knew not what it was his principles of the mathematics which contain     a system of natural philosophy entirely new and true are founded on the discovery of what is called the calculation of infinites the last effect of geometry and which was executed by him at the age of twentyfour this occasioned that great philosopher the learned halley to say it will never be permitted any mortal to approach nearer to the deity numberless good geometricians and natural philosophers were at once improved by his discoveries and encouraged to pursue the course he had pointed out to them bradley at length went so far as to discover the parallax of the fixed stars at twelve millions of millions of miles distant from our little globe halley though no more than a private astronomer had the command of one of the kings ships in      in this ship he determined the position of the stars of the antarctic or south pole and marked the different variations of the compass in all the parts of the known world the famous voyage of the argonauts was in comparison with his no more than the passing from one side of a river to another in a boat and yet this voyage of halleys has scarcely been spoken of in europe this indifference of ours for great things when become too familiar and the admiration paid by the ancient greeks to the most trivial ones is another proof of the prodigious superiority of our age over the ancient times boileau in france     and sir william temple in england obstinately deny any such superiority they seem resolved to depreciate their own age in order to exalt themselves above it this dispute between the ancients and moderns is at length decided at least as to philosophy there is not one of the ancient philosophers whose works are now made use of for the instruction of youth in any of the enlightened nations locke alone might serve as a great instance of the advantage that the present time has over the finest ages of greece from plato down to him there is one great chasm no one during all that interval having explained the operations of the soul and a person who should be acquainted with all that plato has written and acquainted with that only would have very little knowledge and even that erroneous the greek was indeed an eloquent writer his apology for socrates is a great piece of service done to the learned of all nations it is but just to hold in veneration him who made oppressed virtue so venerable and its persecutors so detestable it was for a long time thought that he who was so fine a moralist could not be a bad natural philosopher he was held almost for a father of the church on account of his ternarion which no one understood but what would be thought of a philosopher in our days who would tell us that matter is the author and that the world is a figure of twelve     pentagons that fire is a pyramid and is linked to the earth by numbers how would a person be received who should go about to prove the immortality and metempsychosis of the soul by saying that sleep comes from watching watching from sleep life from death and death from life yet such are the arguments that have been the admiration of so many ages and ideas still more extravagant have since continued to be made use of in the education of mankind locke is the only one who has explained human understanding in a book where there is nothing but truths and what renders the work perfect is that these truths are all clear if we would once for all see in what this last age has the superiority over the former ones we have only to cast our eyes upon germany and the north dantzic has produced a hevelius who is the first astronomer that was ever well acquainted with the planet of the moon no man before him having ever so carefully examined the heavens among the many great men whom this age has produced no one is a more striking example how justly it may be called the age of louis xiv hevelius lost an immense library by fire the french monarch recompensed the astronomer with a present that far overpaid his loss in holstein mercator was the forerunner of newton in geometry the bernouillis of switzerland     were disciples worthy this great man and leibnitz was for some time considered his rival the famous leibnitz was born at leipsic he ended his days in hanover like a true philosopher believing in a god like newton without consulting the various opinions of mankind he was perhaps a man of the most universal learning in europe he was a historian indefatigable in his inquiries a profound civilian who enlightened the study of law by philosophy foreign as it may appear to that kind of study so thorough a metaphysician as to attempt reconciling divinity and the metaphysics a tolerable latin poet and lastly so good a mathematician as to dispute with the great newton the invention of the calculation of infinities and to make it for some time doubted which of them had the justest claim to the honor of that discovery this was then the golden age of geometry mathematicians sent frequent challenges to one another that is to say problems to solve much in the same manner as it is said the ancient kings of egypt and asia sent enigmas to be answered by one another the problems proposed by these geometricians were of a much more difficult nature than the egyptian enigmas and yet none of them remained unanswered either in germany england italy or france there never was a more universal correspondence kept between philosophers than at this period and leibnitz contributed not a little to encourage it a republic of letters was insensibly     established in europe in the midst of the most obstinate war and the number of different religions the arts and sciences all of them thus received mutual assistance from each other and the academies helped to form this republic italy and russia were united by the bonds of science and the natives of england germany and france went to study at leyden the famous physician boerhaave was consulted at the same time by the pope and the czar of muscovy his principal pupils have in like manner drawn strangers after them and have in some measure become the physicians of nations the truly learned of every denomination have strengthened the bonds of this grand society of geniuses which is universally diffused and everywhere independent this correspondence is still carried on and proves one of the greatest comforts against the evils which ambition and politics scatter through the world italy has preserved her ancient glory in this age though she has produced no new tassos nor raphaels it is sufficient that she has once produced them a cabrera a zappi and a filicaia have shown that delicacy is always the portion of this nation the merope of maffei and the dramatic works of metastasio are the beautiful monuments of the age the study of true natural philosophy as established by galileo still keeps its ground in spite of the ancient philosophy which has but too many     bigoted admirers the cassinis the vivianis the mandis the bianchinis the zanottis and many others have spread over italy the same light that beamed in other countries and though its principal rays came from england yet the italian schools have been able to gaze on it in all its splendor every kind of literature has been cultivated in this ancient seat of the arts as much as elsewhere except in those subjects where a liberty of thinking allows a greater scope to the genius in other nations this age in particular has attained a better knowledge of antiquity than the preceding italy furnishes more monuments than all europe together and in proportion as these have been brought to light science has become more extensive we are indebted for this progress to some wise men and geniuses scattered in small numbers over some parts of europe almost all of them for a long time subjected to persecutions and lost in oblivion they have enlightened and comforted the world during the wars that spread desolation through it there are lists to be met with elsewhere of all those who have been the ornaments of germany england and italy it would be very improper in a stranger to pretend to rate the merits of so many illustrious men let it suffice then to have shown that in the last age mankind acquired throughout europe greater light than in all the ages that preceded it     chapter xxxi the children of louis xiv—the sovereign princes contemporary with him—his generals and ministers the children of louis xiv legitimate heirs louis xiv married

common for some time before the death of this prince than the following proverb which was applied to him the son of a king the father of a king and never king the event seemed to countenance the credulity of those who place faith in predictions but this saying was only a repetition of that which went about concerning philip de valois and was moreover founded chiefly on louis xivs own state of health he being much more robust than his son this prince had by mary anne christina victoria of bavaria who died april  0    0       louis duke of burgundy who was born aug        and died feb

celebrated artists and musicians the foregoing review of the progress made in the arts and sciences would be incomplete without a glance at the leading artists in painting and music each nation has its peculiar theories of art which fact tends to the formation of schools modified by conditions of national life scenery climate and largely by patriotic enthusiasms in no art are national characteristics more marked than in that of music french music especially the vocal is disliked by all other nations it cannot be otherwise because the french prosody or versification differs from that of every other country of europe we make the pauses always upon the last syllable whereas all others make it upon the penult or antepenult as the italians our language is the only one that has  0  words terminating in e mute and those es that are not pronounced in ordinary discourse yet are uniformerly so in music as gloire victoire etc hence it comes that most of our airs and recitative are insupportable to those who have not been accustomed to them the climate denies us that flexibility of voice which it gives the italians and it is not custom among us as at rome and other italian courts to make eunuchs of men in order to render their voices finer than those of women all these things joined to the slowness of our singing which by the bye forms a strange contrast with our native vivacity will always make the french music disagreeable to any but frenchmen after all foreigners who have resided some considerable time in france acknowledge that our musicians have performed wonders in adapting their airs to our words and also that the music is very expressive but only so to ears that have been some time accustomed to it and besides the execution must be very good our instrumental music is not altogether free from the monotony and slowness of the vocal but many of our symphonies and tunes have been relished by foreigners they are admitted into many of the italian operas and scarcely any others are in use at the court of a king who has one of the best operas in europe and who among his other  0  extraordinary talents has a fine taste for music which he cultivates with great assiduity jean baptiste lulli who was born at florence in      and came to france at the age of fourteen when he could perform on no instrument but the violin was the parent of true french music he knew how to suit his art to the genius of the language which was the only sure way to succeed but at that time the italian music had not begun to deviate from that gravity and noble simplicity which we still admire in lullis recitative nothing resembles these recitatives more than the motet of lugi sung in italy with so much success in the seventeenth century which begins thus   sunt breves mundi rosœ sunt fugitivi flores   frondes veluti annosœ sunt labiles honores   the roses date is brief   the lilies soon decay   and like the annual leaf   frail honors fleet away it must be observed that in this pure recitative music which is the mélopée of the ancients the beauty of the singing is principally owing to the natural melody of the words no words but such as are musical can well have a place in recitative but of this they were not sufficiently sensible in the days of quinault and lulli the poets were jealous of these gentlemen as poets but not as musicians boileau thus addresses quinault   ces lieux communs de morale lubrique   que lulli ré chaussa des sons de sa musique    0    those hackneyed thoughts so wanton yet so tame   that lulli strove to warm at musics flame the tender passions which quinault expressed so well were much rather a striking picture of the human heart than a loose morality his diction animated the music still more than lullis art did the words these two with the help of actors have of some scenes of atys armida and roland made an entertainment such as no people ancient or modern can match detached airs and ariettes did not at all come up to the perfections of these grand scenes they very much resembled our christmas carols or the venetian barcaroles and yet they were contented with them at that time the more artless the music then was the fonder they were of it after lulli all our musicians such as colasse campra destouches and others copied after him till at last one appeared who far excels them in sublime harmony and has vastly altered and improved the art of music with regard to sacred music though we have had some celebrated composers in france yet their pieces have not been executed anywhere but in the kings chapel painters the case is not the same with regard to painting as with music the latter may be such as to please none but the natives because the genius of the  0  language is incompatible with any other but painters should represent nature which is the same everywhere and seen with the same eyes the only true test of a painters merit is the judgment of foreigners it is not enough that he has a party and is praised by scribblers his works must be in request and bear a high price what sometimes hampers the genius of painters one would be apt to imagine would elevate and enlarge it i mean the particular taste or manner of the school or of those who preside in it academies are without doubt extremely useful to form pupils especially when the directors aim at the sublime in painting but if they are men of grovelling taste if their manner is dry and minute if their figures are ungraceful their pieces painted like fans their pupils are the dupes of imagination or aiming at the applause of a bad master there is a sort of fatality attending academies none of the works styled academic of any kind have been works of genius suppose an artist extremely solicitous lest he should not hit the manner of his fellow academicians his productions will infallibly be stiff and disgusting but if a man is free from these prejudices and aims only at copying nature it is ten to one that he succeeds almost all the eminent painters either flourished before the establishment of academies or got the better of the prejudices contracted there corneille racine despréaux and lemoyne took  0  a route quite different from their brethren and in consequence had most of them for their enemies nicholas poussin was born at andelys in normandy in      nature gave him a genius for painting which he improved at rome he is called the painter of men of sense with equal justice may he be denominated that of men of taste his only defect is his heightening of the dismal and solemn in the coloring of the roman school he was the greatest painter in europe in his time he was invited from rome to paris but was forced to give way to envy and cabal and to withdraw as many other ingenious men have done he went back to rome where he lived poor but contented his philosophy enabling him to despise the frowns of fortune he died in      le sueur born at paris in      had no other master than vouet and yet became a celebrated painter he carried the art to a high degree of perfection when he was taken off the stage of time at the age of thirtyeight years in      bourdon and valentin were eminent men three of the best pictures that adorn the church of st peter at rome are by poussin bourdon and valentin charles lebrun born at paris in      had scarcely begun to display his talent when superintendent fouquet one of the most generous and at the same time most unhappy men that ever lived gave him a pension of twentyfour thousand livres  0  present money his picture of the family of darius at versailles is little short in point of coloring of that of paul veronese which faces it and in design composition dignity expression and observance of costume surpasses it his battles of alexander engraved are still more in request than those of constantine by raphael and julio romano he died in    0 peter mignard born at troyes in champagne in    0 rivalled lebrun for some time but he is now considered as much below him he died in      claude lorrain—his father when he would have made a pastrycook of him did not foresee that he would one day be reckoned one of the greatest landscape painters that ever europe had produced he died at rome in      case—we have some pieces of his that begin to be highly valued we do not do justice to ingenious men in france as soon as we should their indifferent performances often prevent us from seeing the beauties of their masterpieces on the contrary the italians extol what is great and excellent without taking notice of what is indifferent every nation seeks to promote its own glory and renown except the french they value nothing but what is foreign joseph parrocel born in      was a good painter but inferior to his son he died in   0  john jouvenet born at rouen in      was  0  lebruns pupil and a good painter but not to be compared to his master he has painted almost everything yellow for by some extraordinary conformation of his organs they appeared to him of that color he died in      jean baptiste santerre—there are some admirable pictures of his the color of which is just and delicate his picture of adam and eve is one of the finest in europe that of st theresa in the chapel of versailles is a very noble piece but rather luscious for an altarpiece lafosse distinguished himself much in the same way bon boullongne was an excellent painter of which the high price and great demand for his pieces are an evidence louis boullongne—his works though not without merit yet are not so much admired as his brothers raoux—his pieces are not all of equal merit in some of them he is nothing short of rembrandt rigaud—though he excelled chiefly in portraits yet his piece of cardinal bouillon opening the jubilee is not at all inferior to any of rubens detroy—he painted in rigauds manner there are some good historical pieces by his son watteau—he excelled as much in the graceful as teniers did in the grotesque some of his pupils have done him honor lemoine—his hercules apotheosis at versailles  0  is perhaps superior to anything i have yet mentioned it was intended as a compliment to cardinal hercules de fleury who by the way had nothing in common with the fabulous hercules it would have been more apropos to have represented the apotheosis of henry iv in the falcon of a french king lemoine being envied by his brethren and thinking himself illreputed by the cardinal died of grief and despair besides these there have been some other painters who excelled in still life or in painting animals as desportes and oudry others in miniature and others in portraits at present we have some that distinguish themselves in the grand and sublime and posterity in all appearance will have them too sculptors architects and engravers under louis xiv sculpture was carried to perfection in which it still continues under louis xv james sarazin born in    0 executed some masterpieces at rome for pope clement viii and at paris he was equally successful he died in    0 peter puget born in      was an architect sculptor and painter he is celebrated chiefly for his andromeda and milo of crotona he died in      italy is indebted to legros and theodon for many of its embellishments francis girardon born in    0—antiquity can boast of nothing superior to his bath of hercules  0  and his tomb of cardinal richelieu he died in      coysevox and coustou were eminent in their way yet we have three or four sculptors at present that excel them chauveau nanteuil vermeulen audran hedlinger leclerc les drevet poilly picart duchange though they have been outdone yet were ingenious men and their engravings supply the want of original pictures etc all over europe there were also some goldsmiths such as ballin and germain who on account of the beauty of their designs and elegance of execution deserve to be ranked among the most celebrated artists it is more difficult for one born with a genius for architecture to make his talent appear than for any other artist unless he is set to work by princes he has no opportunity to display his taste and skill in any work of grandeur and magnificence thus have the talents of many an architect been entirely useless to him francis mansard was one of the best architects of europe the château or palace of maisons near stgermains is a masterpiece because he was at liberty to give full scope to his genius jules hardouin mansard his nephew was superintendent of the buildings under louis xv and made an immense fortune the beautiful chapel of the invalides is a design of his as to the palace   0 of versailles he could not display his talents to advantag in it by reason of the situation foreigners say that the city of paris has only two fountains in good taste the old one of john gougeon and the new of bouchardon and even these are badly situated neither has it any magnificent theatre besides that of the louvre which is not used the places for the public diversions and representations have neither proportion taste nor ornament and their situation is as bad as their contrivance notwithstanding the example that has been set us by some cities in the provinces but which we have not yet thought fit to follow france however can boast of magnificent buildings of another sort and of more importance such as stately hospitals storehouses stone bridges quays dikes for checking the inundations of rivers canals sluices ports and especially the fortifications of the frontier towns in which beauty is united with solidity the magnificent structures erected from the designs of perrault levau and dorbay are too well known to require mention the art of gardening was in a manner invented and perfected by lenôtre and de la quintinie by the former with respect of beauty and ornament and by the latter with regard to utility engraving of precious stones coining of medals and casting of types for printing have kept pace with the other arts in point of improvement     clocks and watches the makers of which may be considered as a sort of practical naturalists have likewise been carried to a very high degree of perfection the watering of stuffs and the gold with which they are embellished and enriched displays such rare ingenuity and taste that what is worn only from vanity and luxury deserves to be preserved as a monument of industry the making of porcelain was set on foot at st cloud before it was attempted anywhere else in europe in fine the last age has taught the present how to unite and transmit as a sacred deposit to posterity the whole assemblage of the arts and sciences each of them carried to the utmost perfection possible and to do so is actually the object and aim of numbers of learned and ingenious men at this day but such is the brevity of human life that the execution of part of the immense and immortal design must be left to posterity   this anecdote is attested by the memoirs of la porte page     and we there see that the king had taken an aversion to the cardinal that that minister though his relative and intrusted with the charge of his education had taken no care to improve him and had often left him in want of common necessaries he adds much heavier accusations which reflect dishonor on the cardinals memory but they do not appear to be proved and no accusation should be admitted without it   cardinal richelieu had already given balls but they were without taste as were all entertainments before his time the french who have now carried the art of dancing to perfection had only a few spanish dances in the minority of louis xiv as the sarabande the courante etc   a famous surgeon soninlaw to the physician above mentioned is witness of what i have said and mr bernaville successor of st mars has often confirmed it   the abbot stpierre in his annales politiques page  0  of his manuscript says these things plainly show the number of lazy lubbers as also their taste for laziness which sufficiently serves to maintain and cherish other kinds of dronish fellows and yet this is the condition of the italian nation at present where these arts are carried to a high degree of perfection for they are beggars lazy heavy vain poltroons occupied about impertinences etc these rude reflections written in language equally rude are void of justice the time in which the italians succeeded best in these arts was under the medici while venice was in its most warlike and opulent state then it was that italy produced great warriors and illustrious artists of all kinds and it was also in the flourishing years of louis xiv that the arts have been carried to the greatest perfection the abbot stpierre has mistaken a great number of things and has given grounds for regretting that reason has not always seconded his good intentions   claude perrault was a member of the royal academy at paris and bred a physician though he did not practise that art he made some noble designs in architecture and was allowed to be a man of genius by all the world but boileau who from private pique has satirized both him and his brother charles a want of candor in boileau which greatly detracts from the merit of his genius   anthony le prêtre chevalier count de vauban is so well known as the greatest engineer of his time—if coehorn does not contest that preeminence—that we need not dwell upon the particulars of his character   in vol iv p     of maintenons memoirs we find that the capitation brought in beyond the hopes of the farmers but there has never been any farm of the capitation it is said that the lackeys of paris went to the town house to beg that they might be put into the capitation this ridiculous story destroys itself for masters always paid for their domestics   the abbot of stpierre in his journal politique in the article system says that in england and holland there are no more notes than specie but it is certain that the former greatly exceed the latter and do not subsist but by credit   john dominico cassini was one of the most able astronomers that italy ever produced he flourished in the seventeenth century and in his youth was appointed professor of astronomy at bologna but he was invited to france by colbert to be a member of the royal academy of sciences and there he spent the remaining part of his life which was happily extended to extreme old age he explained the nature and revolutions of comets he discovered that the planet mars revolved upon its own axis in twentyfour hours and forty minutes he discerned the spots on the body of venus he demonstrated that saturn had five satellites instead of one which was all that huygens had discerned and he measured a degree of the meridian in the south of france   in   0  six hundred sorcerers were condemned in the jurisdiction of the parliament of bordeaux and most of them burned nicholas remi in his demonolatri gives an account of nine hundred arrets passed in fifteen years against sorcerers in lorraine only the famous curate louis guaffredi burned at aix in      had publicly owned that he was a sorcerer and the judges believed him it is shameful that father lebrun in his treatise of superstitious practices still admits of the decision of doubtful matters by casting lots he even goes so far as to say page     that the parliament of paris acknowledged it but he is mistaken the parliament indeed owned that there were profanations and enchantments but no supernatural effects produced by the devil the book of don calmet sur les vampires et sur les apparitions has been looked upon as the work of a disordered brain but it plainly shows how much the mind of man is addicted to superstition   miracles were said to be performed at the tomb of abbé paris in    0 as this abbé was a professed jansenist the jesuits would not allow him to be a saint and found means to interest both the clergy and the government against his pretensions to this title the archbishop of paris published a mandamus condemning the new miracles of this beatified jansenist the life of the abbé which had been published at brussels was pronounced heretical by the holy congregation of the office and burned by the hands of the hangman but the reputation of the defunct flourished under this persecution his tomb was surrounded by crowds of devotees the lame were cured the blind were restored to sight so that the catalogue of miracles daily increased until the buryingground of st médard was shut up by the kings express arret and then the saint being deprived of his retinue sank into oblivion     four champions fierce   strive here for mastery and to battle bring   their embryon atoms   —paradise lost
