two dithyrambic odes  i on enthusiasm  ii to laughter  by the author of rimes  numerisque fertur lege solutis hor london printed for c dilly  mdcclxxxii  advertisement the reader may perhaps think that there was no occasion to give a new title to these odes the former denomination of irregular being sufficient but ever since the days of cowley irregular odes have had more pretensions to the irregularity of chaos than to that of nature the author has therefore restored their ancient name when a title becomes a badge of indignity it is surely proper to refuse it yet titles are neither here nor there  the italians who alone of all modern nations feel what real poetry what real painting what real music are have many productions of high same under this title the flames would have received the following pieces had not the author known that they have more merit than many productions which have the honor to attain the praise of those who know nothing but he pretends not to the exquisite spirit of poliziano  dithyrambic ode i on enthusiasm shades of poets blessed that often my dreams with rapturous gleams of glory have possessed appear appear appear if yet the mortal vow ye hear o hither from your mansions bright o hither bend your speedy flight while light and odours float around and harps unseen empyreal airs resound say from what living spring descends the flood of fame that bears your sacred strains along the vales and echoing mountains over of each admiring shore while empires all prolong in every varied speech the wonders of your song and languages that have as yet no name their tributary rills shall bring to swell the lordly stream say from what mighty cause is heard the high applause that you the distant climes that you the distant times with adoration have confessed gods of the human breast and moved with filial awe have bent their sense and feeling to your law and noblest homage brought the homage of the thought enthusiasm was that spring enthusiasm was the cause why heard that high applause enthusiasm race divine did all those honors bring ye chief of former days whose daring vows addressed nature ere hid in fashions speckled vest when she great goddess in her prime her virgin fancies played at will fancies surpassing mortal skill and with her sons held colloquy sublime by hallowed fount with verdant gloom oergrown or in the whispering vale or desert mountain lone while forms of heaven not unseen with fairy footsteps paced the green and in mystic notes conveyed things secret from the human thought or eye full often such is thy will o poesy where vulgar minds discern naught save the shade the wise the sun descry qualor di pindo le reine accolgo il fortunato mi o lieto soggiorno sempie di luce intorno che splende ai saggi e si fa nebbia al volgo guidi    for often the sun will shroud his flames behind a cloud and sages ye whose eloquence divine would with a golden chain the hearers soul restrain and bear to every passions distant shrine whose thunder shook the throne of each barbaric lord tho by deluded myriads prone of trembling slaves adored whose lucid art of life illumed the plan and heavenly wisdom brought to dwell with man without thy fierce control enthusiasm soul of the rapt soul picture in vain bids her creation rise music in vain her vocal skill applies in night the fair creation lies the bidden airs sleep in the sullen shell till thou their birth impell at thy command the glowing forms appear at thy command the strains enchant the ear thy praise may every art and science fair impart for all to thee their richest luster owe from thee all attributes of mind that to gods exalt mankind all deeds immortal flow hark hark the sounds of conflict rise what light divine illumes that sacred field leonidas where thy devoted few their fatal falchions drew and of their carcases composed a shield their country to protect from dastard enemies in freedoms holy hand their radiant banner flew before the godlike band her rousing trump enthusiasm blew when bold colombo dared the watery realm a world unknown to find enthusiasm held the helm and with fresh vigor stored his ardent mind till rose the wished shore where empires lost to fame before where golden cities shone and shrines of other sacred powers groves of new pomp and meads of other flowers and other music from the copse was blown oh goddess if one happy clime remains yet secret from the muse thy blessed influence diffuse o lend thy votary thy aid sublime by arts just compass and by fancys gate there to direct his daring sail and treasures bring unknown in former time dithyrambic ode ii to laughter the violet that in the lonely stream beholds her humble head tho saved from icy breeze or sultry beam her fragrant leaves must shed along the stream that fed her life the fragrant leaves are tossed till in the ruthless ocean lost meet emblem of mans fading joy that tho saved from all annoy on times inevitable wave still hastens to the grave to taste the fragrance of the flower and not the flower destroy is wisdom haste the fleeting hour ye race of mirth employ thou laughter lead the festal band wit and humor hand in hand sports that dance and sports that sing love and rapture with thee bring now when merry spring reposes on her bed of balmy roses in fantastic measures revel all along the flowery level sweet melody pervades the luminous air e una melodia dolce correva per laer luminoso  dante purg  the jocund tribes appear my suppliant thy wish declare lo i wait to hear thy prayer while some tho wise in mental gloom their melancholy hours entomb and from terror of the morrow waste the given day in sorrow attend propitious power my claim do thou invading cares repel with thee dear goddess let me dwell and laugh at lifes amusing game the end
