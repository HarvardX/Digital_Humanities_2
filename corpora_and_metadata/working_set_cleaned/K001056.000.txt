an essay on the force of imagination in pregnant women  addressed to the ladies  london printed for r baldwin no    paternoster row  m dcc lxxii  price one shilling  to the ladies ladies being convinced from deliberate reflections that the imagination of pregnant women can make no impression on the form of the foetus and being witness to much unhappiness from adopting the contrary opinion i was led to collect my thoughts on the subject and throw them on paper  as it is a subject under some circumstances of very great importance to the fair sex i am induced to address myself to them in particular in hopes such address may engage an attentive perusal from whence i flatter myself i shall be the means of alleviating those anxious fears raised by prejudice and but too generally attendant on the pregnant state  sensible that physical and anatomical disquisitions cannot be pleasing to the fair sex i have intentionally avoided them as much as the explanation of my subject would admit nor do i think my cause has in the least suffered from such conduct as exclusive of their assistance my design is answered without fatiguing the ladies with perhaps at best but groundless conjecture  in what i have advanced i have taken reason for my guide and have attempted to deliver its dictates with clearness and precision how far my endeavors have succeeded i submit ladies to your decision  and am with all due deference and respect the author  an essay on the force of imagination etc that the imagination of pregnant women is capable to mutilate or deform the foetus is an opinion of a very ancient date and has been supported by the sentiments of the young and old wise and unwise for several centuries past the ill effects of adopting this erroneous doctrine i shall forbear to enlarge on if i prove it to be built on irrational superstitious notions the intent of the following pages will be sufficiently answered  preparatory to this intention i beg leave to observe by imagination i understand as pope and gay express it that power which forms ideal or mental pictures this i apprehend is taking the word in its utmost latitude and under this acceptance we are to consider its effects as they may tend to external objects or as they may influence the animal machine  it will require very little force of argument to show how ineffectual is the power of imagination unassisted to influence or obtain any change on external objects  the utmost exertion of its force can neither deprive the loadstone of its attraction prevent the vegetation of plants or stop the descent of rain for in spite of our most ardent wishes natures laws will be predominant the loadstone will attract plants will vegetate and rain descend  could imagination screen us from want whose wants would be unsupplied the miser would no longer have an object for his avarice the ambitious would possess the extent of his ambition and every man arrive to the summit of his wishes  the impotency of ideal conceptions being so glaringly obvious it would be an insult to our understanding to suppose any change either designed or unintended could take place on external objects respecting their form bulk substance or position without some intervening power hence then to form an object concording with our ideas requires an assistance found only in art by the intervention of this we are enabled to assist or prevent the effects of nature though to pervert the system baffles all human invention  being convinced of the inability of ideal conceptions to produce any change on external objects it naturally occurs to consider what influence the imagination has over the human machine  to attempt the discussion of this consideration in its full extent would lead me into a labyrinth of philosophic theories doubts and disputations the passions of the mind are an inexhaustible fund for philosophical inquiries every day some instances are to be observed where anger grief joy and surprise have produced astonishing changes in the human constitution nevertheless these effects remain inexplicable by the narrow limits of our physiological knowledge hence then i shall limit this consideration to the point in question viz the influence of the imagination on the foetus  to judge of the propriety of what is hereafter to be advanced on this subject it is necessary some idea should be formed of the connections consisting between the mother and embryo  the foetus or embryo during its stay in the womb is envelloped in a peculiar set of membranes of a vascular spongy texture aggregately termed the burden from the attachment the burden forms to the womb subsists a constant circulation of blood between the mother and child  this attachment is formed by an adhesion of the spongy cells of the burden to the veins and arteries of the womb one series of the vessels contained in the burden being filled by means of its attachment to the womb with blood from that organ after a variety of convolutions empty their contents into the veins forming a part of the umbilical cord or navelstring this cord passing from a certain place in the burden enters the body of the foetus at the navel from whence by wonderful mechanism the blood is transported to every very part of the foetus and vessels destined for that purpose to preserve a constant and free circulation without which the foetus must suffer the blood is returned from the child to the arteries of the navelstring from whence it is dispersed into the burden and passing into the spongy cells connected to the womb enters the circulation of the mother and hence between her and the child the intimate connection subsists the ill consequences attending a detachment of the spongy cells of the burden from the womb are too obvious to need mentioning to prevent them comes not only under the province of the physician but the prudent care of every one  the physician will tell you that a distention of the blood vessels from a preternatural fullness or a relaxation from emptiness an undue velocity in the circulation or too great languor are all capable of separating the burden from the womb consequently are all capable of producing abortion and miscarriage  your own good sense ladies will inform you that fear grief anxiety joy or surprise will retard or accelerate the circulating fluids according to the actuating motive hence from these passions miscarriages frequently ensue and give me leave to add this is the greatest effect the foetus can experience from the power of imagination  on a review of the connection subsisting between the mother and child together with a reflection on the natural properties and use of the blood in adults it is very apparent nature intended this circulation solely for the nutrition and perfection of the foetus from the similitude of its office i think it may very aptly be compared to water poured on a plant or seed without which neither the plant would thrive or the seed vegetate the seed of a plant put into water will by the assistance of a due degree of warmth and moisture vegetate and produce a plant bearing the same characteristic marks as that from which the seed was gathered the good or ill quality of the earth the abundance or deficiency of water the proper or improper temperature of the air will affect the seed in no other way than either totally suppressing its vegetation or causing it to shoot forth in a more or less healthy state as its nutritive essentials earth air and water were better or worse adapted for vegetation in the species of plant  the characteristic marks of the plant all spring from that small atom the seed this particle is from the positive laws of nature decreed to shoot forth into such marks colors and fibers as the plant from which it was gathered is distinguished the proper nourishment as i said before that is necessary to vegetation consists of a due mixture and temperature of the earth air and water notwithstanding any defect that may occur in these nutritive principles the seed when it vegetates will produce the characteristic marks of the plant though in an unhealthy aspect to an impregnated woman it is ordained by the same dispensing power to produce an offspring bearing the characteristic marks of the human race it is the office of the circulation passing between the mother and child to afford nourishment to the embryo as it is the office of the elements to produce vegetation in the vegetable kingdom  should sickness anxiety or any cause whatsoever debilitate the constitution of the woman the circulating fluids being thoroughly rendered incapable of affording proper nourishment abortion or the birth of a weakly puny child will be the consequence but the defects in the mothers constitution from whatever cause they may arise can no more alter the original form the foetus was endued with than earth air and water assisted with all the art of man is capable to produce the flower of a rose from the seed of a thistle the inference i draw from this similitude serves only to corroborate this indisputable fact viz the organization of the embryo from the hour of impregnation a fact every one tacitly acknowledges who adopts the opinion that impressions are made on the foetus by the force of imagination such impressions are said to be produced instantaneously and not confined to any term of pregnancy  the defects of a leg toe arm or finger have been ascribed to a sudden surprise on seeing objects in that lamentable state the very supposition tacitly implies the foetus was once perfectly formed or rather that the parts were previous to the surprise in a natural state if then the loss of a member is thus suddenly accomplished i should wish to know how the haemorrhage which must necessarily ensue from the division of such parts was restrained and what became of the separated parts for among all the tales i have heard relative to this subject i do not recollect one that mentions the appearance either of an haemorrhage or of the separated part  the impossibility satisfactorily to answer these inquiries would i should think sufficiently evince the absurdity of the supposition but as these inquiries are unanswerable to explain them is never attempted because such an attempt if impartially pursued must raise a train of ideas that would inevitably destroy an opinion that as it has been strongly inculcated by the prejudice of education requires more trouble to divest ourselves of than mankind in general choose to take but to return more immediately to the subject  we have seen that ideal conceptions can make no impressions on external objects but as such we cannot consider the foetus from it is being so intimately connected with the mother let us view it then in its proper light viz organized matter placed in the womb there to be nourished and brought to a certain degree of perfection and then to be expelled  we have observed that the nutrition necessary to the perfection of the foetus is obtained by the circulating fluids passing between it and the mother exclusive of these fluids we know of no intercourse consequently of no power passing from the mother to the child that can possibly be subservient to the mothers imagination hence then if to mutilate or deform the foetus is the effect of the mothers imagination the blood alone must be the immediate acting principle whether this principle has powers equal to the effects ascribed let plain common sense decide and when it reflects that blood is a smooth oily fluid will immediately acknowledge such consistence sufficiently demonstrates the bloods incapacity to mutilate the foetus or impress any form imagination can devise were the form of the foetus in the power of imagination our offspring would be as subject to the capriciousness of mankind as our clothes  the form of the childs mouth nose eye eyebrow or any of its features would as much depend on the reigning fashion as the cut of a cap coat or any part of our dress  no fortunes would then be forfeited for deficiency of male heirs nor uneasiness at the birth of a son when the mother ardently longed for a daughter  if the imagination could take off or place on the foetus a leg toe or arm it could certainly remove all kind of blemishes with such powerful assistance who would bear the deformity of wens carbuncles warts etc these being excrescences nourished by the circulating fluids and connected to the patient by bloodvessels as the foetus is nourished and connected to the mother if these fluids are so powerful in some cases we may from parity of reasoning expect the same in other  it is evident the imagination unassisted can have no manner of effect on external objects that as the foetus from its situation and intimate connection with the mother is to be considered as part of her fabric yet as to mark or mutilate requires a due degree of force and the only power capable of conveying such force to the foetus in consequence of the imagination is the blood i think it is a very obvious inference that the imagination is as incapable of effecting any impression on the foetus as on any external body whatsoever  from what has been advanced i hope i have satisfactorily proved the imagination can make no impression on the foetus i shall now proceed to show that the marks attributed to the force of imagination are effects proceeding from other causes  the exact manner these marks are formed is beyond the reach of my comprehension to explain to convince you they are not the effects of the cause ascribed let us convey our ideas to the vegetable and brute creation in the former of these we seldom see a collection of apples pears plumbs nuts etc but we discern some protuberance or deficiency in their respective form something altogether out of the general course of nature in the brute creation it is by no means a very unfrequent occurrence to meet cats dogs sheep etc etc dismembered and impressed with the greatest variety of marks can we attribute these appearances to the force of imagination we know of no such existence in the vegetable kingdom and in the brute creation under the form of instinct only it is universally acknowledged there is no satisfactory way to account for these appearances we call them deficiences or luxuriances of nature if then nature proves deficient in the productions of the animal and vegetable kingdom by what system of logic are we to expect she will be infallible to the offspring of man  man claims a superiority over all other created beings from his peculiar endowment reason this blessing constitutes his dominion nevertheless the same omnipotent wisdom is observed in the mechanical structure of a fly as in the formation of man hence we may conclude that no peculiar providence is established for the perfection of mankind beyond those laws of nature framed by the omnipotent being for the perfection of every created object when infants come into the world with narrow breasts one shoulder higher than another or with inverted feet we do not always attribute them to the force of imagination but sometimes to inexplicable causes in nature if thus we acknowledge nature protrudes some parts and contracts others i think it would be a greater proof of our reason to attribute all impressions and marks to the same source than to believe the idle tales of ignorance and superstition it has never been supposed the imagination could change the sex of the child that has ever been deemed impossible but the same chain of arguments that will convince us of the impracticability of such metamorphosis must also convince us that to mutilate or deform the foetus by the same power is equally impracticable  i shall next offer to your consideration a few thoughts on the longings and strange ideas some pregnant women are possessed with strange as these ideas are they are not as is generally supposed peculiar to pregnancy but are to be observed in men and maidens whatever may be the cause i think they are evidently the symptoms of a depraved taste or appetite  those conversant in the practice of physic find it no very unusual thing for a patient either in a fever in an insane state of mind or in the green sickness which is the most familiar to crave after what in an healthy state they had conceived a great aversion to can we account for these cravings in any other way than saying they are the symptoms of a vitiated taste brought on by a disease in the circulating fluids to believe this a fact and that it is so to me appears incontestable we must immediately infer that as taste is a sense liable to be vitiated by an alteration in the circulating fluids and as the disposition of the circulating fluids evidently becomes altered from impregnation the desires and longings of pregnant women are to be considered like those of men the mere effects of a depraved or vitiated taste  from what has been advanced i hope ladies you are now sensible no power of imagination can effect any mark or impression on the foetus nevertheless i apprehend though your reason may in this coincide with my opinion yet the prejudice of education is so very predominant that you cannot totally divest yourselves of the contrary opinion  the many tales you have heard in its favor has as it were fortified your mind against the convicting power of reason to remove that barrier is a very difficult task as it is not always in our power immediately to divest ourselves of those prejudices that have been adopted by our friends and by them inculcated with our education  to say that all the tales which have formed these prejudices and told us by our ancestors with all the confidence of truth believed by our prejudiced friends who to corroborate their fathers or grandfathers report will attest similar occurrences to have happened within their own knowledge i say for me to declare all these tales are false and erroneous would be deemed to their authors veracity the grossest insult and in me such a step would appear the highest pitch of arrogance to avoid the first and wave the imputation of the latter i shall only say as my private opinion that our friends reason has been misled and either the histories have been misrepresented or the events recorded in them ignorantly accounted for in defense of this opinion i beg leave to produce some instances wherein will appear the ignorant credulity of two of the greatest philosophers as ever adorned the english nation  the great sir francis bacon attributes the cure of some warts he was afflicted with to rubbing them with some lard to which adhered the skin which was afterward exposed to a south wind  the hon mr boil records as facts among many other the following histories  a great lady far from being credulous confessed to me as also did some of her servants that with the common remedy of ashashes formed by warm urine into seven or nine cakes and buried some days in a dunghill she was cured of the yellow jaundice after having passed through a tedious course of physic  a physician afflicted with a marasmus a species of consumption boiled an egg till it was hard in his own urine and with a bodkin perforated the shell in many places and buried it in an ants hill where as the emmets devoured it he found his strength return and his disease decrease  riverius tells us that the daughter of a great officer was excessively tormented with a whitloe for which he ordered her finger to be put into the cats ear and within two hours after she was freed from pain  these few instances i have selected are such that to believe them in the light these great men have shown them in no one in this age who boasts common sense unentrammeled with superstition will pretend to nevertheless they are told with a confidence of their veracity and told by men of incontested learning and abilities from such authorities why do we discredit them  because that spirit of free enquiry and general improvement which distinguishes the present era has convinced us though the facts may be deemed indisputable that neither exposing the lards skin to a south wind burying the seven or nine cakes of ashashes under a dunghill the destruction of the egg by the ants or placing the finger in the cats ear effected the cure respectively ascribed to each  the melancholy effects said to arise from the sting or bite of the tarantula cured only by the charms of music are almost universally believed and too wellknown to need a repetition yet these effects are now rejected by people of sense and discernment as tales propagated by knavery and imposition the existence of the tarantula is not doubted but its bite from experience has been found attended with no other inconvenience than would have ensued from the sting of a large gnat or wasp  the stories first told of the strange symptoms attending the bite of this spider were undoubtedly raised to answer some sinister view the credulous superstitious multitude swallowed the bait and thus have enabled the cheat to be carried on to this very day by cunning vagabonds who taking advantage of the superstitious folly of the country act in confederacy with the fiddler to excite charity the wild extravagant gestures said to be the symptoms produced by the venomous bite of the tarantula  this contradiction to the received opinion is now well attested but i believe the united testimonies of all the learned in england will never eradicate the contrary notions from the vulgar and illiterate  in every age and clime the crafty knave has found a multitude to receive his impositions the powers of amulets and charms the bottle conjuror rabbit woman cocklane ghost witchcraft and fortunetelling are perpetual testimonies of english credulity  if we pass to our neighbors under the papal jurisdiction we shall there find credulity in if possible a more glaring absurd light when we reflect on this prevailing folly of mankind and that physic was once in the hands of priests subjected to all the impositions paganism ignorance and superstition could devise we cannot wonder there should remain some tints of its former subordination  those who are wanting either of leisure or abilities to think for themselves in matters of science are apt to place too great a faith in all that is told them hence a continuance of error and i think it is pretty obvious while this oral tradition continues there ever will be some who will rely on the influence of the moon and stars the powers of amulets and charms and all such idle unphilosophical notions  the same chain of ideas that shows the impropriety of believing the cure of a toothache by a charm the destruction of warts by turning thief and stealing raw meat the cure of the cramp by wearing rosemary or placing the soals of our shoes uppermost when we go to bed i say the same chain of ideas that shows the impropriety of believing these absurdities will when applied with a real desire to be informed whether the imagination in pregnant women possesses the powers ascribed convince the enquirer that the tales told of the mothers imagination exerted on the foetus are a collection of falsities formed by superstition and ignorance and continued by prejudice and credulity  i have now ladies finished my intended plan am sensible how difficult a task it is to remove deeprooted prejudice but however unsuccessful my attempt may be to that purpose my intentions i flatter myself are irreproachable and if the arguments i have used have not sufficient weight to induce my fair reader to adopt my opinion they are such as will not incur her censure  finis
