the speech of r b sheridan esquire on wednesday the  th of february      in bringing forward the fourth charge against warren hastings esquire relative to the begums of oude  the second edition revised corrected and enlarged  price one shilling  prefatory address from the publisher solicitous as the public are to have a perfect copy of the most eloquent speech that was ever delivered in parliament their wishes must be in a great measure disappointed from the very liberal determination of mr sheridan to give no kind of assistance in reporting it publicly a determination that does as much honor to his humanity as his oration does to his abilities  having called forth his wonderful talents whilst in the double office of a senator and an accuser of the great delinquent he now sinks the apparent though just severity of the public character in the humane sensibility of the private individual and generously withholds that torrent of eloquence which must excite in every breast sentiments of indignation against the atrocity which demanded it to flow  the intention of this publication is not to excite those sensations the nobleminded speaker wishes to suppress it is not to hold forth the character of an eastern spoiler for scorn to point the finger at  it is meant to commemorate the virtues of a patriot mind vindicating the honor of his country and pleading the cause of humanity and as near as is in the power of recollection to preserve to the public eye partially at least one of the most complete pieces of oratory that ever graced an english or any other senate  in doing this the reporter frankly confesses the fallibility of the means  all that he can boast is to have come as near the original as the reminiscent faculties of a person habituated to parliamentary business would permit how far they have succeeded those who had the felicity of being present are the most competent to judge  mr sheridans speech february        on the fourth charge against mr hastings in a committee of the whole house mr st john in the chair mr dempster having communicated to the house that a paper which he held in his hand had been received by him from sir elijah impey with a request that he would read it as it was explanatory of some passages which he had given in evidence at the bar of the house but which explanation the house did not think proper to receive but from the mouth of sir elijah impey himself and he not being present mr sheridan was called upon  mr sheridan during a speech which lasted near five hours and three quarters commanded the most profound attention and admiration of the house his matchless oration united the most solid argument with the most persuasive eloquence his sound reasoning giving additional energy to truth and his logical perspicuity and unerring judgment throwing a light upon and pervading the obscurity of the most involved and complicated subject  mr sheridans preeminence and unrivalled abilities will from this period stand recorded as having had power to assimilate the most discordant sentiments upon a great and trying occasion and with a few exceptions to unite the various opinions of the multitude in one point  he commenced his elegant speech by saying that had it been possible to have received without the violation of the established rules of parliament the paper which the honorable gentleman mr dempster had just now read he should willingly have receded from any forms of the house for the purpose of obtaining farther illustration of the subject then before them yet he had not come so ill prepared as by a trifling circumstance to be prevented from proceeding to the discharge of his duty or that the want of it could make any impression on the body of proof he was to bring forward that day against warren hastings  in his opinion the explanation of the evidence so far from throwing any new light upon it and clearing it up rendered it even more obscure and contradictory than before every art was made use of to impress the house with an idea that this business was not of the most serious nature but this was far beneath his notice the justice and strength of his cause were not to be overcome by such pitiful and flimsey expedients nor should he waste his time in opposing measures which were as paltry and inefficacious as they were insidious  he would not he said encroach upon the time of the committee with any general argnments to prove what was in itself so obvious that the subject of the charge which it fell to his lot to bring forward was of great magnitude the attention parliament had bestowed upon indian concerns for many sessions past the voluminous productions of their committees on that subject the various proceedings in that house respecting it their own strong and pointed resolutions the repeated recommendations of his majesty and their repeated assurances of paying due regard to those recommendations as well as various acts of the legislature were all of them undeniable proofs of the moment and magnitude of the consideration and tended to establish this broad fact that they acknowledged the british name and character to have been dishonored and detested throughout india by the malversation and crimes of the servants of the east india company that fact having been established beyond all question by themselves and their own acts there needed no argument on his part to induce the committee to see the importance of the subject about to be discussed that day in a more striking point of view than they had themselves placed it in  there were he knew persons without doors who affected to ridicule the idea of prosecuting mr hastings and in proportion as the prosecution became more serious to increase their sarcasms upon the subject by asserting that parliament might be more usefully employed that there were matters of more immediate moment to engage their attention that a commercial treaty with france had just been concluded and that it was an object of a vast comprehensive nature and was of itself sufficient to engross their consideration  to all this he would oppose these questions was parliament mispending its time by enquiring into the oppressions practiced on millions of unfortunate persons in india and endeavoring to bring the daring delinquents who had been guilty of the most flagrant acts of enormous tyranny and rapacious peculation to exemplary and condign punishment was it improperly employed in giving an eminent but severe example to their future servants of the madness and folly of relying on corruption and sycophancy for support in the day of trial for their crimes was it a misuse of their functions to be dilligent in attempting by the most effectual means to wipe off the disgrace that stood affixed to the british name in india and to rescue the national character from lasting infamy were the good faith and credit of britain of no consequence in the eyes of the representatives of the nation surely no man who felt for either the one or the other would think that a business of greater moment or magnitude could occupy his attention or that the house could with too much steadiness too ardent a zeal or too industrious a perseverance pursue its object indeed they must all know and feel the necessity of bringing this important case to the issue now intended their conduct in this respect last year had done them immortal honor and proved to all the world that however degenerate an example of the conduct of englishmen some of the british subjects had exhibited in india the people of england collectively speaking and acting by their representatives felt as men should feel on such an oecasion that they were anxious to do justice by redressing injuries and punishing offenders however high their rank however elevated their station  mr sheridan said he would exhibit to their view a body of information which would prove the commission of the most horrid crimes ever conceived by the foulest heart that ever inhabited a human frame facts which persons of every party of every political bias in this kingdom had been assisting in bringing to view in these had the indefatigable attention and labor of several committees been employed it was the work of many years these were fully demonstrated in the various clear and elaborate reports which had been long upon their table their long and interesting debates their solemn address to the throne and their rigorous legislative acts  the vote of the house last session wherein the conduct of this pillar of india this corner stone of our strength in the east this tallisman of the british dominions in asia was censured did the greatest honor to that house as it must be the forerunner of speedy justice on that character which was said to be above censure and whose conduct we were given to understand was above suspicion his deeds were such they could not be justified by any possible necessity for no situation however elevated however embarrassed could justify a man for committing acts of rapacity upon individuals to the honor of that house they had resisted the monstrous argument attempted to be set up they had shown their detestation of that novel and base skepticism on the principles of judicial enquiry constantly the language of the governor generals servile dependents that such horrid crimes should be compounded that though m hastings might be guilty of all the charges exhibited against him he ought not to be punished he should still be considered as the savior of india and that fortunate events were a full and complete fetoff against a system of oppression corruption breach of faith peculation and treachery what though king lords and commons were against him he was not a person to be assailed for he had a vote of thanks from the court of proprietors in his pocket the committee had however nobly combated such doctrine and declared that mr hastingss treatment of cheyt sing was unjustifiable upon any ground of political necessity their solemn and awful judgment that in the case of benares mr hastingss conduct was a proper object of parliamentary impeachment had covered them with applause and brought them forward in the face of all the world as the objects of perpetual admiration to use the words of a right honorable gentleman mr pit on this subject the committee had found in the administration of mr hastings  acts of strong injustice of grinding oppression and nnprovoked severity that committee had also rescued his right honorable friend mr burke from the imputation of being a false accuser they had shown that he was not moved by envy by malice nor any unworthy motives to blacken a spotless name they had approved him to be what in reality he was an indefatigable and he was happy to add a successful champion in the cause of truth humanity and justice with sound judgment with manly firmness with unshaken integrity had his right honorable friend resisted the timid policy of mere remedial acts even the high opinion of mr hastingss successor even the admitted worth of lord cornwalliss character had been deemed by him an inadequate atonement to india for the injuries so heavily inflicted on her the committee had by their vote solemnly pledged themselves to india they had audibly said to the inhabitants of that country there shall be no more remedial acts you shall no longer be seduced into temporary acquiescence by sending out a titled governor or a vapouring set of resolutions it is not with stars and ribbands and all the badges of regal favor that weatone to you for past delinquencies these should bend to the sacred shrine of justice and the people of india shall be convinced of our honest intentions you shall have the solid consolation of seeing an end to your grievances by an example of punishment for past offenses the house has set up a beacon which while it served as a guide to themselves would also make their motions more conspicuous to the world that surrounded and beheld them he had no doubt of their manly determination to go through the whole of the business with the same steadiness which gave such sterling brilliancy of character to their outset and that they might safely challenge the world to observe and judge of them by the result  after an exordium of this tendency mr sheridan took notice of a paper signed warren hastings which had been put into his hand as he entered the house that day and which he considered as a second defense and a second answer to the charge he was about to bring forward a charge replete with proof of criminality of the blackest die of tyranny the most base and unprecedented of treachery the most vile and premeditated of corruption the most open and shameless of oppression the most grinding and severe and cruelty the most unmanly and unparalleled  there never was a question since the creation of the world wherein so much cruelty wickedness inhumanity and depravity were put to the test as in the present case he was no party accuser i call said mr sheridan upon his advocates to watch my words and to take them down i will exhibit no charge that has not solid truth for its foundation for i trust nothing to declamation mr sheridan added he was far from meaning to rest the charge on assertion or on any warm expressions that the impulse of wounded feelings might produce he would establish every part of the charge by the most unanswerable proof and the most unquestionable evidence the witness whom he would bring forth to support every fact he intended to state should be for the most part a witness that no man would venture to contradict no other than warren hastings himfelf  and yet such a character had friends  he blamed them not  they might possibly conclude him innocent  because he himself asserted it was so  the defense of mr hastings would establish every charge he had to make against him there was not one fact which was not founded on or mixed with falsehood no one question that was truly given nor one single conclusion which followed fairly from the premises laid down but of this assertion the multiplied proofs would shortly arise  mr sheridan said he would go farther back into a detail of facts than his right honorable friend had done in his charge in order the more clearly to show the committee the situation in which the british government of india stood with respect to the nabob of oude and the begums till the design of obliging the nabob to plunder those unfortunate princesses his mother and grandmother of their treasures to confiscate their jaghires and seize upon the ministers throw them into a dungeon there load them with chains and keep them for many months close prisoners suffering incredible hardships was first entertained by the governor general  mr sheridan here read a variety of extracts from mr hastingss defense wherein were stated the various steps taken by mr bristow the companys resident at fyzyabad in the years      and      to procure aid for the nabob from the begum the dowager princesses of that district and that he thought proper to exact by his sole authority thirty lacks of rupees for the use of the nabob vizier of oude out of the treasures bequeathed to the begum by her late husband sujah dowla obtaining however the guarantee of the governor and council that that exaction for which no shadow of right was shown should be the last mr hastings however had not stated one of the facts truly groundless nugatory and insulting were his affirmations that the seizure of treasures from the begums and the exposition of their pilfered goods to public auction unparallelled acts of open injustice oppression and inhumanity were in any degree to be defended by those encroachments on their property which had taken place previous to his administration or by those sales which they themselves had solicited as a favorable mode of their supplying a part of their aid to the nabob the relation of a series of plain indisputable facts would irrecoverably overthrow a subterfuge so pitiful a distinction so ridiculous it must be remembered that at that period the begums did not merely desire but they most expressly stipulated that of the thirty lacks promised eleven should be paid in sundry articles of manufacture was it not obvious therefore that the sale of goods in the first case far from partaking of the nature of an act of plunder became an extension of relief of indulgence and of accommodation by the passages which he should beg leave to read mr hastings wished to insinuate that a claim was set up to the begums treasure as belonging of right to the nabob in this transaction mr hastings endeavored to shift the responsibility from himself to the majority of the council and under that authority to keep alive the nabobs right  mr sheridan in order to prove the oppression of the princesses in      which was much aggravated in      read an extract of a letter from the bhow begum mother of the nabob to mr hastings received at calcutta december         wherein she says if it is your pleasure that the mother of the late nabob myself and his other women and infant children should be reduced to a state of dishonor and distress we must submit but if on the contrary you call to mind the friendship of the late blessed nabob you will exert yourself effectually in favor of us who are helpless and again if you do not approve of my remaining at fyzyabad send a person here in your name to remove the mother of the late nabob myself and about  000 women and children that we may reside with honor and reputation in some other place this letter and several others were read to prove the controuling power of mr hastings in oude at so late a period as before mentioned and to prove that every circumstance of oppression and exaction practiced on these princesses was done by the orders consent and approbation of the governor who was supposed to be paramount in oude  treasure which was the true source of all the cruelties was the original pretense which mr hastings made to the company for the measure and through the whole of his conduct he makes mahomedanism an excuse as if he meant to insinuate that there was something in mahomedanism which made it impious in a son not to plunder his mother but to show how the question precisely stood when mr hastings begun the attack mr sheridan read the minutes of general clavering colonel monson and mr francis who severally spoke of a claim which had been made by the nabob on the bhow begum in the year      amounting to two and a half lacks the opinion contained in those minutes was that women were on the death of their husbands entitled by the mahomedan law only to the property within the zenana where they lived this opinion was decisive mr bristow used no threats no military execution or rigor was even menaced the begums complied with the requisition then made and the disputed property then claimed was given up  after this the farther treasure that was within the zenana was confessedly her own no farther right was set up no pretense of any kind was advanced to claim the residue nay a treaty was signed by the nabob and ratified by the resident mr bristow that on her paying thirty lacks she should be freed from all farther applications and the company were bound by mr bristow to guarantee this treaty here then was the issue after this treaty thus ratified could there be an argument as to the right of the treasures of the begums if the mahomedan law had given a right was not that right concluded  mr sheridan averred that the mahomedan law did not authorize the seizure of the princesses property that several jaghires were left them by the late nabob sujah doulah for their own maintenance and the education of their children that the plunder was never authorized by the board and that military execution being used for the recovery of the exactions was contrary to every principle of justice and that the nabob complied reluctantly in many instances that mr bristow acted under the orders of his immediate superior that when the whole transaction was censured mr hastings then threw off all responsibility and appealed pealed to the orders of the board at a time when he knew the authority of the board was vested in himself alone there being only one other member and the governor having the casting voice every act must become his own this said mr sheridan is somewhat similar to the following case  if some five years hence i was to become a warm admirer of mr hastingss late administration and from friendship become his panegyrist would not some person who hears me now remind me of my accusations against him and say to me why this sudden change of opinion i could only answer that i thought so then but since that time i had changed my opinion and that i was not answerable now for what i then did in my official capacity what must the world think of such tergiversation of such meanness is there any man in this house that would countenance such a nefarious procedure after a solemn guarantee and assignment is entered into thus to break the public faith which was pledged to preserve their property is a transaction that honor shrinks from the begums were said to be in the habits of disturbing the public peace but there is no instance on record of any such attempt until the revolution of benares and then all india seemed to be hostile to england  i would here sit down and rest my question of censure on the issue of what has been produced as it must be clear to every member that the princesses were entitled to our protection and that every hostile attempt to wrest their property from them was unjust and disgraceful i require no other proof for this than mr hastingss own words wherein he says that our officious interference made us many foes  in      we entered into another treaty with the nabob which was negotiated by mr middleton wherein it was stipulated that the bhow begum was not to be molested and not long after mr hastings transmits to the court of directors a distressful picture of the situation of the nabob of the horrors and famine which triumphed over his country  if it were possible for a country to be still more distressed the nabobs territories were so in the year    0 but at that period there was a majority in council whose sentiments were by no means favorable to the persecuting schemes of the governor and for this reason there was then no offer to molest the property of the begums  in the subsequent year however the governor took especial care to furnish himself with power the treaty of chunar was executed and surely a treaty so marked with dissimulation was never before entered into the governor made himself responsible for every political transaction in that ravaged and oppressed country  mr sheridan said he had now reached the period when mr hastingss first intentions appeared to enforce the execution of his projects at all events when by mr middleton his private agent he urged the nabob asoph ul dowla to break this solemn engagement sanctioned by the guarantee of the company to deprive his mother and the elder begum his grandmother of the jaghires which were assigned for their support and proceeding still farther to plunder them of their treasures which he had avowed to be their sole property and which he had solemnly pledged himself should remain inviolate it was a little difficult however here to say what was the question at issue it had sometimes been said that the nabob had an inherent right to this wealth as the wealth of the state but when it was recollected that it was not made up of the produce of taxes but collected by the conquests of his father sujah dowla by him bequeathed as a personal acquisition prudently for his son whom it would only make the object of rapacious attack and to whom he with more wisdom bequeathed necessity as his sword and poverty as his shield and when it was considered in what manner and on what condition it was relinquished by the nabob and that dereliction guaranteed by the company he thought that ground of defense would scarcely be occupied on the present day mr hastings in his defense had taken a more extended field where there was more scope for his delusion more amplitude for his equivocation he had admitted the right to have rested in the begums but contended that it had been forfeited by their frequent acts of contumacy and rebellion this allegation against them had been divided into four parts  the charges were the following    that they had given disturbances at all times to the nabob and that they had long manifested a spirit hostile to his and to the english government    that they excited the zemindars to revolt at the time of the insurrection at benares and of the resumption of the jaghires    that they resisted by armed force the resumption of their own jaghires and    that they excited and were accessory to the insurrection at benares  to each of these charges mr sheridan made distinct and separate answers by a variety of extracts which he read some of them written by mr hastings himself to prove that they had particularly distinguished themselves by their friendship for the english and the various good offices they had rendered government against the first charge mr sheridan adduced proofs in the most pointed terms from the several letters which passed between mr hastings and mr middleton colonel hannay and the nabob by this correspondence it was very evident that their conduct during the period from      to      so far from being what it was represented had been mild and inoffensive not a single symptom of inveteracy not one solid proof of disaffection was mentioned in these letters but in all their conduct appeared as much the reverse as it was in the nature of things to expect the second charge fell to the ground the instant it was examined for so far from any undue influence being used on the part of the begums to stimulate the jaghirdars to resistance it did not even appear that the smallest resistance was made by the jaghirdars against the violences which they sustained the third charge was equally false did they resist the resumption of their own jaghires though if they had actually resisted it could not be deemed criminal for those jaghires were their own property vested in them and confirmed to them by a solemn treaty but is there in fact one syllable of charge alleged against them with all the load of obloquy which the nabob incurred had he ever accused them of the crime of resisting his authority no he had not  to prove the falsehood of the whole of this charge and to show that mr hastings originally projected the plunder that he threw the odium in the first instance on the nabob that he imputed the crimes to them before he had received one of the rumors which he afterward manufactured into affidavits he recommended a particular attention to dates and he deduced from the papers these clear facts  that the first idea sprung from mr hastings on the   th of november      that mr middleton communicated it to the nabob and procured from him a formal proposition on the  d of december that on the  st of december mr hastings wrote a letter to mr middleton confirming the first suggestion made through sir elijah which letter came into the hands of mr middleton on the  th of december he stated all the circumstances of the pains taken by mr middleton who was empowered by mr hastings to force the nabob on whom all the blame is laid and whose act it was to seize on his mothers jaghires and coupled this with the extraordinary minute written by mr hastings on his return to calcutta where he stated the resistance of the begums to the execution of the resumption on the  th of january      as the cause of the measure in november      mr middleton had proved that the nabob had no such intention for in writing to mr hastings he says finding the nabob wavering in his determination of the resumption of the jaghires i this day  th dec      in the presence of his minister informed him that unless he would issue his perwannahs for that purpose i would issue my perwannahs  mr sheridan then took pains to show that the begums were by their condition their age their infirmities etc almost the only two souls in india who could not in some measure have hurt the government he did not he said take pains to do this from any idea that because there was no motive for plundering the women it might be asserted that it was an improbable falsehood he was not to learn that there was such a thing as wantonness of wickedness those who had doubts on this point had only to read the history of the administration of mr hastings he proved by the documents on the table that there was and had always been insurrection and disorder in oude to ascribe it to the begums was the most improbable fiction they might as well say that famine would not have pinched that thirst would not have parched that extermination would not have depopulated but for the interference of these old women to use a strong expression of mr hastings on another occasion the good that those women did was certain the ill was precarious he on the contrary took the converse of the proposition wanting a motive for his rapacity he could find it only in fiction the simple fact was their treasure was their treason they complained of injustice god of heaven had they not a right to complain after a solemn treaty violated plundered of all their property and on the eve of the last extremity of wretchedness were they to be deprived of the last resource of impotent wretchedness complaint and lamentation was it a crime that they should crowd together in fluttering trepidation like a flock of resistless birds in the air on seeing the felon kite who having darted at one devoted bird and missed his aim singled out a new object and was springing on his prey with more vigor in his wing and keener lightning in his eye the fact with mr hastings was precisely this having failed in the cause of cheyt sing he saw his fate he felt the necessity of procuring a sum of money somewhere for he knew that to be the neverfailing receipt to make his peace with the directors at home  such mr sheridan added were the true substantial motives of the horrid excesses perpetrated against the begums excesses in every part of the description of which he felt himself supported by the most indisputable evidence here he would rest his cause let gentlemen lay their hands upon their hearts and with truth issuing in all its purity from their lips solemnly declare whether they were or were not convinced that the real spring of the conduct of mr h far from being a desire to crush rebellion an ideal fabulous rebellion was a malignantly rapacious determination to seize with lawless hands upon the treasures of devoted miserable yet unoffending victims  amongst other proofs which mr sheridan brought against the second and fourth charges was a minute of what mr stables proposed at the board whether any disaffection to the english government appeared before the troubles of benares mr hastings remained silent  in the farther discussion of the charges mr sheridan said it would be necessary for him to follow the governor general in his tour from calcutta to chunar which commenced the  th of july      a journey he thought necessary to take finding the nabob unwilling to seize on his mothers jaghires mr hastings had himself said that he left calcutta with the strongest idea of the reduced state of the companys possessions which the event proved he went to recruit in the most expeditious manner possible sir elijah impey had said when under examination that mr hastings went out with only two resources to retrieve the circumstances of the company namely benares and oude countries already oppressed by the hand of providence but more so by the wicked and arbitrary machinations of man what a horrid idea no other resource but the plunder of a famished country can any simile equal it unless i suppose a person determined on a robbery and having failed at bagshot resolves to try his fortune at hounslow  in benares it was sufficiently known that mr hastings had failed there his prodigal revenge had disappointed his rapacity whence the unfortunate victim of malicious insolence had been compelled to wander from his kingdom a melancholy example of the vicissitude of human affairs the hopes of plunder at oude promised to compensate for his miscarriage at benares then and not till then not through any former enmities shown by the begums not through any old disturbances but because he had failed in one place and that he had but two in his prospect did he contrive the expedient of plundering these aged women he had no pretense he had no excuse for his conduct but the arrogant and obstinate determination to govern india by his corrupt will his disappointment at benares urged him with rapid steps to oude where indeed he was but too successful  inflamed by disappointment in his first project he hastened to the fortress of chunar to meditate the more atrocious design of instigating a son against his mother of sacrificing female dignity and distress to parricide and plunder  the treaty of chunar that nefarious foundation of his future views being planned mr hastings thought it necessary whilst he was invading the substance of justice to avail himself of her judicial forms and accordingly sent for sir elijah impey the chief justice of india to assisth im  sir elijah being arrived mr hastings with much art proposed a question of opinion involving an unsubstantiated fact in order to obtain even a surreptitious approbation of the measures he had predetermined to adopt  with regard to the mode of submitting questions to sir elijah impey it was he observed singular and curious in respect to the affairs of cheit sing mr hastings had stated the question not in the abstract merely but accompanied with the fact to that question sir elijah demurred not caring to commit himself with regard to the begums mr hastings profits by his experience and states the question in the abstract saying the begums being in rebellion is it not warrantable to seize their treasures to this which like one of the duke of richmonds data carries with it its own answer because being in rebellion the seizure might have been made sir elijah answers directly and explicitly in the affirmative thereby not risking any thing  not a syllable of enquiry intervened as to the existence of the imputed rebellion nor a moments pause as to the ill purposes to which the decision of a chief justice might be perverted it was not the office of a friend to mix the grave caution and cold circumspection of a judge with an opinion taken in such circumstances and sir elijah had previously declared that he gave his advice not as a judge but as a friend a character he equally preferred in the strange office which he undertook of collecting defensive affidavits on the subject of benares  it was curious mr sheridan said to reflect on the whole of sir elijahs circuit at that perilous time sir elijah had stated his desire of relaxing from the fatigues of office and unbending his mind in a party of health and pleasure yet wisely apprehending that very sudden relaxation might defeat its purpose he contrived to mix some objects of business with his amusements he had therefore in his little airing of  00 miles great part of which he went post escorted by an army selected those very situations where insurrections subsisted and rebellion was threatened and had not only delivered his deep and curious researches into the laws and rights of nations and of treaties in the capacity of the oriental grotius whom warren hastings was to study but likewise in the humbler and more practical situation of a collector of ex part evidence in the former quality his opinion was the premature sanction for plundering the begums in the latter character he became the posthumous supporter of the expulsion and pillage of the rajah cheyt sing  with a generous oblivion of duty and honor with a proud sense of having authorized all future rapacity and sanctioned all past oppression this friendly judge proceeded on his circuit of health and ease and while the governor general sanctioned by his solemn opinion issued his orders to plunder the begums of their treasure sir elijah pursued his progress passing through a wide region of disress and misery in quest of objects best suited to his feelings in anxious search of calamities most kindred to his invalid imagination friendship then made sir elijah forget what was due to himself what was due to the high office in which he was placed and to the power which had placed him in it he was the last man who ought to have undertaken such an office he was bound to have maintained a line of conduct more consonant with the elevation of his rank the dignity of his office and the gravity of a judge who ought to have felt himself incapable of soiling his pure ermine by condescending to run about the country like an itinerant informer with a pedlars pack of garbled evidence and surreptitious affidavits  he could not be ignorant of the robbery his errand was intended to cover for his first question mooted the point the judge most gravely informs us that he was cautioned not to proceed from chunar by way of fyzyabad as the begums were in rebellion most friendly advice indeed fyzyabad was many score of miles out of the route of lucknow to chunar and at that moment peace absolutely prevailed in every part of the country his datum therefore would have been discovered to be false nor would it have been very pleasant for him to be found at fyzyabad with the actual order in his pocket by which they were to be plundered which happened to be the fact here mr sheridan proved what he asserted by reading extracts from authenticated papers  when mr hastings arrived at chunar he was met by the nabob with an open and unsuspecting heart here the most insidious treaty on the one part that ever was entered into was concerted and concluded no one article of it being intended for execution on the part of the governor in the first article it was stipulated with one he calls an independent prince that as great distress has arisen to the nabobs government from the military power and dominion assumed by the jaghierdars he be permitted to resume such as he may find necessary with a reserve that all such for the amount of whose jaghires the company are guarantees shall in case of the resumption of their lands be paid the amount of their net collections through the resident in ready money and that no english resident be appointed to furruckabad  this was solemnly covenanted in direct infraction of a subsisting guarantee for the protection of the begums jaghires and how was this cloaked why by affidavits taken extrajudicially by his majestys chief justice in bengal who says very guardedly in his evidence that several persons deposed that a design was entered into to extirpate the english from india but when not till after the transactions at benares when the weight of the arm of power compelled that unfortunate prince cheyt sing to become an unhappy wanderer and when the name of briton became detested throughout hindostan this artifice was thin and the veil was easily seen through for the plan was preconcerted long before the revolution at benares took place  this first article containing a general permission to the nabob to confiscate and take into his hands such jaghiers as he might find necessary mr hastings inverted singularly by making him confiscate whatever jaghiers he pleased  the second article stipulated for the withdrawing of the british army from the province of oude which mr hastings did but inverted the article singularly by reserving to himself a right to send another army into the province when he thought proper the two other articles the one for withdrawing the british president at furruckabad and the other stipulating for putting fizula cawn into the hands of the nabob both by a singular inversion mr hastings rendered of no effect or avail  the unsuspecting nabob in the warmth of friendship at meeting the governor and concluding a treaty which he thought salutary to his interest made him a present of one hundred thousand pounds this exclaimed mr sheridan was rank corruption in mr hastings the circumstances of this present were as extraordinary as the thing itself four months afterward and not till then mr hastings communicated the matter to the company unfortunately for himself however this tardy disclosure was conveyed in words which betray his original meaning for with no common incaution he admits the present  was of a magnitude not to be concealed  then it was published and made known that bills on gopaul doss the banker then a prisoner were given to the amount mentioned payable in four months and this was to be extorted from a country at the time its prince declared his inability to pay his debts and when his minister hyder beg cawn declared it to be  a speaking picture of famine and woe mr sheridan in stating all the circumstances of this bribe averred that the whole had its rise in a principle of rank corruption for what was the price that hepaid by the treaty he agreed to withdraw all the english gentlemen and all the english army he agreed to this at the moment of rebellion and revolt the other articles of the treaty as strange nothing but the bribe could have occasioned together with the reserve which he had in his own mind of treachery to the nabob for the only part of the treaty which he ever attempted to carry into execution was to withdraw the english gentlemen from oude the nabob considered this as essential to his deliverance and his observation on the circumstance was curious for though major palmer said he has not asked any thing i observe it is the custom of the english gentlemen constantly to ask for something of me before they go this imputation on the english mr hastings countenanced most readily and rejoiced at it as it was a screen and shelter for his own abandoned profligacy and therefore at the very moment that he was himself plundering the nabob with his usual gravity and cant making a feint of executing this part of the treaty go said he to the english gentlemen go you set of oppressive rascals go from this worthy unhappy man whom you have plundered and leave him to my protection you have robbed him you have taken advantage of his accumulated distresses but please god he shall in future be at rest for i have promised he shall never see the face of an englishman again this however was the only part of the treaty which he even attempted to fulfill and we learn from himself that at the very moment he made it he intended to deceive the nabob that he advised general instead of partial resumption in order to defeat the end and view of the nabob and instead of having given instant and unqualified assent to all the articles of the treaty he had perpetually qualified explained and varied them with new diminutions and reservations  he had suffered the nabob to take their jaghiers from several jaghierdars but he had compelled him to deprive others of theirs according to his will he withdrew the army according to the wish of the vizier but it was only to send back almost instantly an equivalent force he resigned the fortresses but to garrison them again immediately this might by the friends of mr hastings be deemed policy but surely it was too clumsy a fraud too gross a fallacy to deserve that name it was however like the man though unlike the greatness ascribed to him  mr sheridan put the whole of this into a very glaring point of view and called upon gentlemen to say if there was any thing in machiavel any treachery upon record if they had ever heard of any cold italian fraud that could in any degree be put in comparison with the disgusting hypocrisy and unequalled baseness that mr hastings had shown on that occasion  in his defense mr hastings had made it his boast that the conduct of his life had been uniformly governed by the rules of honor and plain dealing he asked how was this bold and daring assertion to be reconciled to his whole conduct throughout the affair of the begums in every part of which obliquity fraud falsehood treachery oppression the most glaring violation of justice and the most open breach of solemn engagements were the great and leading features he had heard it said by some of his admirers but who were not so implicit as to give unqualified applause to his crimes that they found an apology for the atrocity of his actions in the greatness of his mind he could not upon the closest examination of his conduct discover the smallest symptoms of either a great mind or great ability to estimate the solidity of such a defense it would be sufficient merely to consider in what consisted this prepossessing distion this captivating characteristic of greatness of mind it was the characteristic of magnanimity to aim at attaining a great end by great means to support truth to protect the weak to relieve the oppressed to right the injured to punish those that had done wrong and on no consideration to countenance injustice in these traits and these alone we are to discover true estimable magnanimity to them alone we can justly affix the splendid titles and honors of real greatness were these the characteristicks of mr hastings directly the reverse mr hastings in his conduct and in his writings exhibited a system made up of things unnaturally conjoined his letters and his minutes were full of strutting meanness bombastical prevarication and ridiculously violent contradictions in terms just as the mass and magnitude of his crimes were contrasted with the littleness of his motives and the low means he could condescend to for the attainment of his objects the most grovelling ideas he conveyed in the most inflated language giving mock consequence to low cavils and uttering quibbles in heroics so that his compositions disgusted the minds taste as much as his actions excited the souls abhorrence in short he appeared to be a mixture of the trickster and the tyrant at once a scapin and a dionysius it seemed that all his actions were directed by a low underhand crooked policy as well might the writhing obliquity of the serpent be compared to the direct and unvaried swiftness of the arrow as the duplicity of mr hastingss ambition to the simple steadiness of genuine magnanimity mr hastings if he ever acted with wisdom it was with perverted wisdom  mr sheridan said that this mixture of character seemed by some unaccountable but inherent quality to be appropriated in inferior degrees to every thing that concerned his employers he remembered to have heard a learned gentleman mr dundas remark that there was something in the original frame and constitution of the company which carried the sordid ideas of the mercantile principle on which it was founded always about them so that even in all their measures and actions we saw the paltry character their civil policy and their military achievements were connected with and contaminated by the meanness of pedlars and the profligacy of pirates thus we saw auctioneering ambassadors and trading generals  and thus we saw a revolution brought about by affidavits an army employed in executing an arrest a town besieged on a note of hand a prince dethroned for the balance of an account they exhibited a government in which they had all the mock majesty of a bloody scepter and the little traffic of a merchants counting house wielding a truncheon with one hand and he might truly say picking a pocket with the other  he then proceeded to state the conduct of mr hastings in enforcing the resumption of the jaghire and the plunder of the envied treasure of the begums on the   th of nov      his pleasure concerning that business was first sent through sir elijah impey to mr middleton on the  st of december this was backed by a written order and it was not until the  th of january following that the nabob could be prevailed on to dismiss his scruples nor until threatened with the severest displeasure of the governor general that he could be compelled to repair to fyzyabad to obey the unnatural mandate by plundering his parents a resistance was then made by the friends of the begums on finding the violence intended to them but strange to tell this resistance was absolutely alleged by mr hastings in his defense as the sole cause of the violence that is to say the resistance of an unjust attack not made until after the  th of january      was alleged as the foundation of the pleasure signified on the   th of november      of the written order by which that was enforced and all the determinations which had so long preceded or in other words the order was said to be founded on a resistance made to its being executed near six weeks after that order was first issued  having gone through the facts of the transactions which made up the charge mr sheridan next adverted to the affidavits exhibited and sworn before sir elijah impey and though he said he might fairly throw them aside and put them out of the question on account of the indirect manner in which they were obtained and the strange and irrelevant testimony they afforded yet he would wave all objection to them on those grounds and examine them with as much seriousness as if they were correctly formal and every way unexceptionable they were all he said conceived in one spirit and formed upon one plan he then read the affidavit of mr middleton and clearly pointed out how futile and presumptuous were the grounds upon which he had to the satisfaction of his conscience proceeded to the utmost extremity of violence against the begums the god of justice exclaimed he forbid that any man in this house should make up his mind to accuse mr hastings on the ground that mr middleton condemned the begums he next animadverted on the depositions of colonel hannay colonel gordon major mdonald major williams and others from which he struck out a variety of such brilliant detections as baffle memory to follow  amongst a variety of glaring circumstances he pointed out the following  major williams amidst other rumors stated one that  he had heard that  0 british troops watching  00 prisoners had been surrounded by  000 of the enemy and must inevitably have fallen a sacrifice if they had not been relieved by the approach of a detachment of nine men with this assistance they had entirely driven away the enemy and slain several hundreds of them considering the character given by mr h to the british army in oude that they manifested a rage for rapacity and peculation it was extraordinary that there were no instances of stouter swearing of mr m he said that he liked not the memory which remembered things better at the end of five years than at the time unless there might be something so relaxing in the climate of india affecting the memory as well as the nerves by which the traces of actions were lost and that men must return to their native air of england and be braced up and have their memories like their sinews restrung  mr sheridan pointed out many other improbabilities and having in very strong colors painted the loose quality of the affidavits and clearly and incontrovertibly shown the partiality and injustice which was contained in them against the begums he solemnly appealed to that side of the house which was more peculiarly interested in lawproceedings they saw that that house was the path to fortune in their profession that they might soon and some of them were to be called to a dignified situation where the great and important trust would be reposed in them of protecting the lives and properties of their fellow subjects  one learned gentleman in particular was if rumor spoke right soon to be called to succeed that bright luminary of the law whose sun he feared was setting but whose departure from the seat of active justice was splendid and magnificent in its being done while he possessed a mind on which time had not power to lay his hand of the learned gentleman the successor he must say that there was not one circumstance of his life except perhaps his activity on an election contest that did not distinguish him as a most proper person to fill the important seat he desired to ask that learned gentleman and every other of the profession would he lay his hand upon his breast and solemnly declare if upon such evidence as the mass of depositions taken at lucknow any one of them could venture to say that sitting as a judge he would be legally warranted to convict any the meanest individual of an offense however trivial if any one would say he could he declared to god he would sit down and not add a syllable more to the too long trespass he had made on the patience of the committee  here mr sheridan craved the indulgence of the house  a general and loud cry of hear hear whilst he for a moment enquired into the spirit and temper of the affidavits on which the ruin of the unfortunate begums was founded colonel gordon had exhibited a flagrantly conspicuous proof of the grateful spirit and temper of affidavits designed to plunge these wretched women in irretrievable ruin colonel gordon was but just before not merely released from danger but preserved from imminent death that gentleman was in the hands of the insurgents and his release was entirely effected by the negotiation of the bhow begum yet even at the expiration of two little days from his deliverance he deposes against the distressed and unfortunate woman who had become his savior and only upon hearsay evidence accuses her of crimes and rebellion upon this occasion she manifested the strongest attachment to the english interest for in her private letters and dispatches to colonel hannay she particularly desired that the zemindars might not be informed of her interposition in favor of the colonel this was at once a bold and convincing proof of her unalterable attachment was this a proof of rebellion great god of justice exclaimed the orator can thou from thy eternal throne look down upon such premeditated turpitude of heart and not fix some dreadful mark of obloquy upon the perpetrators  if continues mr sheridan these affidavits because they are a mere collection of hearsays without a tittle of any thing like legal evidence in their composition could not as i am certain is the case be received in a court of law nor be brought forward in a court of equity was it a species of evidence sufficient to justify a wanton act of oppression of violence and gross injustice committed against two princesses the one the wife the other the mother of the deceased nabob sujah ul dowlah  mr hastings asserts that the resumption of the jaghires was no injury to the begums for they had their revenue of them delivered regularly  but that was not truth  they never had an equivalent  they were referred for payment to a bankrupt on the faith of a broken guarantee there never was any information that could warrant the seizure of the jaghires it was not done with the consent of the nabob though he was forced by mr middleton to give his nominal assent thereto for mr middleton had written to mr hastings that a fixed melancholy had seized the nabob on his being forced to plunder his mother mr middleton had written to mr hastings for his orders on the  st of december      which arrived on the  th and on the   th of the same month the whole was put in execution but as they perfectly knew it was a matter that of course must make much noise it was deemed necessary by mr hastings and his party to throw the whole of the odium on the nabob by insisting that the proposition came from him  but the very letter in which it was asserted that the nabob had not only given his consent but even proposed this detestable measure could not be produced nor any one paper article or authentic evidence to that effect notwithstanding the industry with which it had been reported  the nabob in his letter to mr hastings never gave the least hint that either his mother or grandmother were in rebellion or that they had shown an inclination to assist or join with cheyt sing or that they meant to extirpate the english or dethrone him  mr sheridan proceeded to demonstrate that the princesses were in every sense of the word entitled to their jaghires and possessions as much as any lady in england to her dower on the death of her lord that this opinion had not so much as been called in question till the time that mr hastings began to set his heart upon their treasures  and that asserting the contrary under the mahomedan law was neither founded in justice reason nor even that law and this mr sheridan proved beyond the power of contradiction  he then showed from a variety of statements from mr hastingss own papers that the nabob never entertained an idea that the possessions of his mother were his during her life  on the contrary that his father sujah ul dowlah had left her in the tranquil possession of those estates and treasures for the mere purpose of supporting her dignity in the style becoming her rank and birth  mr sheridan observed that when asoph ul dowla blamed his father for leaving so little wealth he thought like an unwise prince  his father sujah ul dowla acted prudently in leaving him with no temptation about him to invite acts of violence from the rapacious he clothed him with poverty as a shield and armed him with necessity as a sword  in consequence of his poverty and distresses the bhow begum his mother it was true made her son many presents and even lent him money for which he had given an equivalent and once on his representing his distressed situation she had returned all his pledges and a very large sum of money such as she thought would finally put an end to his distresses the nabob her son had given a receipt to that effect which receipt was read by mr sheridan who strongly pointed out the obligation he was under to her he then enlarged upon the character and estimation in which the princesses were held and in the most pathetic language dwelt on the purity of their conduct the reciprocal return of filial and parental affection  when mr middleton went to seize fyzyabad the eunuchs were taken prisoners as was the fouzder of tanda him however it was not thought necessary to detain he had not the key of the treasure the eunuchs had that and they of couse were the principal objects  it was asserted that the nabob gave puerile excuses for not plundering his mother  reasons for not performing the worst of actions the most unnatural crime that of a child ruining his parent was by a christian governor thought puerile  was it to be supposed that two old infirm women whose whole dependence was on the british possession one of whom had been a witness of the success of the british arms for the british arms had deposed her husband sujah ul dowlah and british generosity had again placed him in his dominions should wish to extirpate the english  saib allys behavior was passed over as having done more good by preserving a few prisoners than he had done harm why was not the same favor shown to the begums when the foot of the oppressor was taken off the trodden on rose against the persecutor as against another sujah what a miserable situation must the poor unfortunate wretches be in to have those for their judges who would benefit by their destruction  when the court of directors sent to mr hastings to revise the charge against the begums and mr stables moved that revision in council he was overruled by mr hastings who said that the majesty of justice ought to be approached with solicitation and that it would debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and the promise of redress  conscious however of the enormity of his conduct he apologizes to the court of directors by stating that it would be  a very severe task for a mother to impeach her son  so that according to his idea it was no crime for a son to rob and plunder his parents but it was a crime of a very deep dye for an injured parent to complain of the outrage of her child  he next proceeded to show that mr hastings and he alone was the actor and perpetrator of those crimes that he was regularly acquainted with all the enormities committed there was the clearest proof it was true that middleton was rebuked for not being more exact he did not perhaps descend to the detail he did not give him an account of the number of groans which were heaved of the quantity of tears which were shed of the weight of the fetters or of the depth of the dungeons but he communicated every step that he took to accomplish the base and unwarrantable end he proved by his letters dated in jan      that he alone was responsible for the whole proceedings mr hastings well knew that the ja ghire and the treasure were the only means which the begums were in possession of to support the numerous family of the late nabob amounting to more than two thousand persons  after having in the most pathetic and forcible manner given an affecting description of the distresses of these unfortunate princesses he went farther into the exposure of the evidence into a comparison of dates and the subsequent circumstances in order to prove that all the enormous consequences that followed from the resumption in the captivity of the women and the imprisonment and cruelties practiced upon their people were solely to be ascribed and imputed to mr hastings he said that mr hastings had once remarked that a mind touched with superstition might have contemplated the fate of the rohillas with peculiar impressions but if indeed the mind of mr hastings had been touched with superstition if his fancy could suffer any disturbance and even in vision he could imagine that he beheld the great spirit of sujah dowlah looking down on the ruin he had wrought on his house  in that palace which mr hastings had first wrested from his hand and afterward restored to him  plundered by that very army by which sujah dowlah had been able to vanquish the mahrattas  seizing on the very plunder which he had ravaged from the rohillas  that middleton who had been engaged in managing the previous violations most busy to perpetrate the last that very hastings whom on his deathbed he had left the guardian of his wife and mother and family turning all those dear relatives the objects of his solemn trust forth to the merciless season and to a more merciless soldiery  a mind touched with superstition must indeed have cherished such a contemplation with very peculiar impressions  mr hastings had endeavored to throw a portion of the guilt upon the council although mr wheeler had never taken any share and mr mpherson was not arrived in india when the scene began mr sheridan remarked that he had shrunk from the inquiry ordered by the court of directors under the new and pompous doctrine that the majesty of justice was to be approached with supplication and was not to degrade itself by hunting for crimes if his picture of justice was right then the committees of this house in the examination of smith were wrong  mr dundas was wrong  he hoped however that mr hastings would be found wrong  i trust said the eloquent speaker that this house will vindicate the insulted character of justice  that they will demonstrate its true quality essence and purposes  that they will evidence it to be in the case of mr hastings active inquisitive and avenging  mr sheridan having in the course of his wonderful speech taken a most comprehensive view of the business and examined with the most elaborate research and scrutinizing attention every circumstance with which it was connected having urged every thing which he thought necessary to develope the iniquitous conduct of mr hastings to substantiate the charge and to establish it by the incontrovertible evidence of an infinity of facts he drew toward a conclusion by stating a summary of the great points contained in it he contended and maintained that it was evident the begums had done nothing to merit such violence that the pretense of their having been the fomenters of rebellion with a view to exterminate the english from the province of oude was a mere pretense wholly unfounded and not supported by any evidence and that such an idea had never been conceived until mr hastings concluded that to be the probable means and a favorite resource for the obtainment of money  a resource that he was determined in defiance of reason justice and humanity and at all events to make certain of mr hastings had violated the the solemn guarantee of the company and had broken their faith pledged by treaty he had throughout his conduct been guided by baseness falsehood and oppression entering into treaties and framing stipulations which at the moment he was concluding and agreeing upon he had no purpose of fulfilling  mr hastings had degraded and sunk the dignity and character of the highest and most honorable office that of a chief justice by making sir elijah impey run about the country collecting affidavits  he had by paltry quibbles and pitiful evasions neglected to proceed upon the enquiry directed by the board at the indiahouse taking a mean advantage of the directors orders and had clothed that evasion with a pompous parade of words and a ridiculous display of nonsensical phrases on the majesty of justice  that through the whole of the transaction the conduct of the governorgeneral had been marked with the most scandalous duplicity the basest perfidy the most unparalleled and grinding oppression and the most insolent wanton and unmanly cruelty  he had made a son plunder his mother and grandmother and reduced to distress two princesses of high rank  he had sullied and disgraced the british name and character  mr hastings he observed was a man of wonderful prescience for it was evident that he knew nothing of what would lend his conduct a color of justification till after it was over but he foresaw that there would be proof of a rebellion and  strange to tell  it turned out exactly as he predicted  mr sheridan then made a solemn appeal to the house conveyed in such a sublime and astonishing style of elegance and worked up with such pathos and dignity in such fascinating language that the house was wrapped in mute attention to keep way with him through such a rapid stream of eloquence desies all power of retention it was wholly impracticable to do more than watch the current as it flowed and now and then casually to grasp some passing flowers within our reach  he stated to the house that the matter of charge was no question of party factions and parties he knew existed in that house the prerogative of the crown found its advocates among the peoples representatives the privileges of the people met with their opponents habits connections parties all led to a diversity of opinions the measures of every minister were supported by one body of men and thwarted by another but on great questions they had he was happy to remark often distinguished themselves by laying aside all petty party considerations and acting with a firmness and decision that reflected honor upon their character  when inhumanity presented itself when the majesty of justice was to be supported he trusted no division could be found among them when the former became the object of their attention they would sit upon it as their common enemy as if the character of the land were involved in their zeal for its ruin and they would leave it not till it was completely overthrown  he hoped they would now step forward regardless of the minister  regardless of the influence of the crown  and vote against the most enormous crimes that ever disgraced human nature  on the present occasion they were called upon to retrieve millions of their fellow creatures from a state of misery and oppression it was true they could not see the innumerable beings whose wretchedness they would relieve the multitudes of famished females had not reached the house and terrified it into a contemplation of their miseries but for that reason the more magnanimous would their conduct be the more glorious their determination to punish such delinquency was a british parliament to wait for their bar to be surrounded with the screams of expiring children and the shrieks of starving women before they stooped to redress their grievances  no  let the world behold an example that the commons of great britain will stretch the strong arm of justice across the habitable globe to show in glowing colors the greatness and power of a british parliament in reprobating injustice in stigmatizing inhumanity and in delivering over to condign punishment those who used unlimited power merely for the purposes of tyranny oppression rapacity and perfidy it was not given to that house as it was to the officers who had the felicity to relieve and the still greater transport of a susceptible mind to perceive the extatic emotions of gratitude in the instant of deliverance they could not behold the workings of the heart the quivering lips the trickling tears the loud though tremulous joys of the millions whom their vote that night would snatch from the tyranny of corrupt power but though these circumstances were not perceptible to them was not the true enjoyment of benevolence increased by the blessing being conferred unseen would not the omnipotence of british justice and a british parliament be demonstrated to the wonder of nations by stretching its mighty arm across the globe and saving by its fiat millions from destruction and would the blessings of the people thus saved diffuse in empty air no  heaven says he if i may dare to use the figure  heaven itself shall become the agent to receive the blessings of their pious gratitude and to waft them to your bosoms  mr sheridan returned his warmest thanks to the house for the indulgence he had experienced in a speech that carried him beyond the limits of his strength but he trusted that strength would soon be repaired from the consideration of having endeavored to discharge his duty in the support of untainted innocence  he then concluded  it is with confidence i now move sir that warren hastings be impeached  the question was then read by the clerk to the following purpose  that the committee upon hearing evidence and considering the said charge are of opinion that there is sufficient ground to impeach warren hastings esquire of high crimes and misdemeanors upon the matter of the said charge  mr burgess spoke for nearly an hour in defense of mr hastings which defense he grounded on the  0th report when  sir william dolben rose and observed that mr sheridan having in his speech stated in so able a manner such a variety of facts and arguments as must have exhausted the spirits as well as the attention of the committee he therefore recommended an adjournment  mr stanhope was of the same opinion and was determined not to give his vote till he had again collected his reason and had given the subject a new and serious consideration  mr fox argued against the adjournment  major scott rose and accused mr sheridan of having been guilty of most gross misrepresentations that in referring to several parts of the correspondence relative to the begums he had omitted several parts of the letters and offered to proceed to the proof when  the chancellor of the exchequer in a very candid and liberal manner passed many deserving and high encomiums on mr sheridans speech and was strenuous for the adjournment  mr fox replied to mr pit and in a speech of some length still opposed any adjournment  this brought up  mr wilberforce who for similar reasons with mr pit sir william dolben and mr stanhope was anxious to adjourn  mr fox rose to explain and amongst other things said that an adjournment would certainly impress the public mind with a very unfavourable opinion of mr hastingss cause  mr sheridan said that he should not again have troubled the committee had it not been to clear up a foul and he must say an unjust aspersion cast against him of misrepresenting or of not reading the evidence faithfully he protested that he had not to the best of his knowledge omitted a single sentence that was material and that his wish was to state the whole faithfully as to the adjournment the committee would see his reason for not saying any thing on the subject mr martin mr montague and mr st john severally spoke when  mr sheridan rose a third time and said that if gentlemen really meant to press it to a decision he did not wish to take the sense of the house on the question of adjournment  sir william dolbens motion was then read and passed without a division and the speaker having resumed the chair the house adjourned at half past one  thursday the  th the house having met and resolved itself into a committee the subject was resumed mr pit bore a conspicuous part in the debate at the conclusion of his speech  mr sheridan rose and said that after the extraordinary indulgence which he had the honor to experience last night he would now trespass but a few minutes on their time he felt himself however called upon to congratulate the right hon gentleman mr pit on the very able candid and manly manner in which he had delivered his sentiments on that occasion he congratulated the house he congratulated his country that in the cause of humanity they saw a minister who was not to be biassed by any motives of political interest who by his conduct on that day had placed his character above the reach of suspicion he was not so vain as to imagine that any arguments he had advanced on the subject had made any impression on the right honorable gentlemans mind if they had it was more a tribute to the cause of truth and justice than a compliment to him  with respect to what the hon gentleman major scott had mentioned of his being alluded to as one of the dependents of mr hastings mr sheridan declared upon his honor that if he made use of such an expression he had not the smallest intention of conveying any insinuation that tended to reflect on the hon gentleman he had every allowance to make for opinions that were formed on the prejudices of human nature he was not surprised that the hon gentleman viewed the conduct of mr hastings in a light different from other men for when the heart acknowledged an obligation it would never suffer the judgment to be influenced by it if he had uttered harsh expressions he declared they were not the result of malignity or the offspring of vindictive malice  he thanked god he had a heart incapable of cherishing either and if he had spoken warmly it was on a question which he confessed had deeply agitated his mind and excited his feelings that question would soon come before another tribunal and which would decide between the house of commons and mr hastings  several other gentlemen having spoken the question was at last put and the house divided when the numbers were ayes     noes    majority for mr sheridans motion  0    finis
