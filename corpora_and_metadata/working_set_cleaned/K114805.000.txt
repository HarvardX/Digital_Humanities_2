cheap repository john the shopkeeper turned sailor or the folly of going out of our element in which a particular account is given of the several branches of this worthy family part ii    sold by j marshall printer to the cheap repository for religious and moral tracts no    queen street cheapside and no   aldermary churchyard and r white piccadilly london  by s hazard at bath and by all booksellers newsmen and hawkers in town and country  price an halfpenny or  s  d per  00   s  d for  0  d for     entered at stationers hall  john the shopkeeper etc twas told you in a former lay how on a luckless evil day the trader john a landsman brave left the dry ground to try the wave but here the poet must rehearse in soft and sweet and tender verse how gentle johnny had a wife the joy and solace of his life the sharer of his griefs and cares privy to all his great affairs one who when tied in wedlocks noose had proved a helpmate sit for use one whom he married  not for whim  but who could keep his house in trim no highslown miss or belle or beauty a simple girl that knew her duty had well obeyed her father mother and counseled well her younger brother healthy when young and rather stout moral  nay more she was devout and now a christian quite at heart she carefully fulfils her part well skilled alike her house to guide and serve the shop at johnnys side see now she works to help the trade and now instructs her under maid   but it is her chief and special care her husbands daily toil to spare when sick or weary and oppressed to ease the troubles of his breast to soothe his sorrows calm his fears and help him through this vale of tears remind him where his treasure lies and point to realms above the skies where when this shifting scene is over the faithful meet to part no more now twenty summers or above have glided by and proved her love and though they may have marred her face have ripened many a christian grace hence it may now be fairly guessed her latest days shall be her best john knows her worth and nowadays he grows quite eager in her praise for every calling friend is told my wife is worth her weight in gold to this blessed couple there was born one daughter cheerful as the morn a maiden she of spotless fame even in her mirth quite clear from blame trained in religions narrow way her mind untainted by a play she hates your giddy glittering scenes though long since entered on her teens sees all things in a proper light and vice quite puts her in a fright prompt and obedient from a child obliging humble meek and mild still before strangers as a mouse yet vastly useful in the house  toils for the shop though seldom seen  ah  there she sits behind the screen there like some flower both sweet and gay she shuns as yet the blaze of day well does her praise adorn my tale a newblown lily of the vale now should perchance some fool draw near and get to whisper in her ear of plays and balls and fairs and races fine midnight routs and public places and wonder how she can endure a life so useful and so pure  extol her form her piercing eyes and tell a hundred flattering lies  while the sweet praise he thinks she sips the tortured maiden bites her lips thinks his fine flattery mere pretense and longs to tell him to talk sense yet dreads to take the dunce in hand lest he should still not understand but should he let his vice peep out the meekeyd girl can then turn stout for once it is said in terms direct a spruce and saucy spark she checked she grew so solemn in her speeches the bucks give out that nancy preaches and once put on the sweetest air and begged a carman not to swear thus while she spends her peaceful days her parents care she well repays honors her father loves her mother she will prove methinks just such another and though scarce seen except at church the men will not leave her in the lurch some honest christian man she will strike no buck or blood  for like loves like next in my song of equal fame comes a good honest ancient dame johns mother  with no fault but one  i mean  she doated on her son for when her own dear spouse was gone her whole affections fell to john twas then the widows age so great her prospects small her income strait that johnny weighed the matter well and took her to his home to dwell no cost or trouble did he grudge for john had rightly learned to judge that people once of little fame but now of high and mighty name often owe the glory of their station to the mere help of education quoth he  were all men good and true their wealth methinks might half be due to some good dame who now is found quite thrust upon the mere back ground besides he added half in tears a child is always in arrears in debt alas over head and ears oh with what joy what thanks and praise to the great lengthner of her days what feelings not to be outdone toward her dear john her only son did the good parent take her station and kindly own the obligation and now his tenderness she pays by helping in a thousand ways decked in her best she comes in view and serves the shop from twelve to two knows not each price perhaps quite pat yet keeps the crowd in civil chat till john himself comes up to sell a yard of lutestring or an ell next to the cook her aid she brings and does a hundred little things loves her own self to lay the cloth to dress the sallad skim the broth   at shelling peace is quick and nimble though now grown tardy with her thimble and always puts you quite at ease walks out and leaves you if you please plain as she seems has much good sense and hence she never takes offense and all agree for all are lenient the good old ladys quite convenient yet let me add if things go wrong madam soon shows her fears are strong and then she gives a certain spice of plain and downright good advice talks in a most convincing tone of what she is seen and what she is known and in a way that vastly wins will warn you of her own past sins tranquil at eve in elbow chair tells what her former follies were   recounts her dangers nice escapes sad sufferings once and awkward scrapes and while she paints her varied life adds wisdom even to johnnys wife john warned of her each matter weighs and nancy trembles and obeys thus some old seaman once so brave and buffeted by wind and wave of the rude seas too long the sport enters at length some peaceful port rejoices now no more to roam yet acts as pilot nearer home end of part ii
