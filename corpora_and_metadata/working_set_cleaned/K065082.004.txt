ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and bishops the praises of julian were the jealousy of constantius against julian repeated with transport in every part of the empire except in the palace of constantius the barbarians of germany had felt and still dreaded the arms of the young caesar his soldiers were the companions of his victory the grateful provincials enjoyed the blessings of his reign but the favorites who had opposed his elevation were offended by his virtues and they justly considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court as long as the fame of julian was doubtful the buffoons of the palace who were skilled in the language of satire tried the efficacy of those arts which they had so often practiced with success they easily discovered that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation the ridiculous epithets of an hairy savage of an ape invested with the purple were applied to the dress and person of the philosophic warrior and his modest dispatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious greek a speculative soldier who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of the academy omnes qui plus poterant in palatio adulandi professores jam docti recte consulta prospereque completa vertebant in deridiculum talia sine modo strepentes insulse in odium venit cum victoriis suis capella non homo ut hirsutum julianum carpentes appellantesque loquacem talpam et purpuratam simiam et litterionem graecum et his congruentia plurima atque vernacula principi resonantes audire haec taliaque gestienti virtutes ejus obruere verbis impudentibus conabantur ut segnem incessentes et timidum et umbratilem gestaque secus verbis comptioribus exornantem ammianus xvii     the voice of malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of victory the conqueror of the franks and alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt and the monarch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honorable reward of his labors in the letters crowned with laurel which according to ancient custom were addressed to the provinces the name of julian was omitted constantius had made his dispositions in person he had signalized his valor in the foremost ranks his military conduct had secured the victory and the captive king of the barbarians was presented to him on the field of battle from which he was at that time distant above forty days journey ammian xvi    the orator themistius iv p       believed whatever was contained in the imperial letters which were addressed to the senate of constantinople aurelius victor who published his abridgment in the last year of constantius ascribes the german victories to the wisdom of the emperor and the fortune of the caesar yet the historian soon afterward was indebted to the favor or esteem of julian for the honor of a brass statue and the important offices of consular of the second pannonia and prefect of the city ammian xxi  0  so extravagant a fable was incapable however of deceiving the public credulity or even of satisfying the pride of the emperor himself secretly conscious that the applause and favor of the romans accompanied the rising fortunes of julian his discontented mind was prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants who colored their mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and candor callido nocendi artificio accusatoriam diritatem laudum titulis peragebant hae voces fuerunt ad inslammanda odia probris omnibus potentiores see mamertin in action gratiarum in vet panegyr xi      instead of depreciating the merits of julian they acknowledged and even exaggerated his popular fame superior talents and important services but they darkly insinuated that the virtues of the caesar might instantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes if the inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to their duty or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge and independent greatness the personal fears of constantius were interpreted by his council as fears and envy of constantius a laudable anxiety for the public safety whilst in private and perhaps in his own breast he disguised under the less odious appellation of fear the sentiments of hatred and envy which he had secretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of julian  the apparent tranquillity of gaul and the the legions of gaul are ordered to march into the east a d   0 april imminent danger of the eastern provinces offered a specious pretense for the design which was artfully concerted by the imperial ministers they resolved to disarm the caesar to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and dignity and to employ in a distant war against the persian monarch the hardy veterans who had vanquished on the banks of the rhine the fiercest nations of germany while julian used the laborious hours of his winter quarters at paris in the administration of power which in his hands was the exercise of virtue he was surprised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and a notary with positive orders from the emperor which they were directed to execute and he was commanded not to oppose constantius signified his pleasure that four entire legions the celtae and petulants the heruli and the batavians should be separated from the standard of julian under which they had acquired their fame and discipline that in each of the remaining bands three hundred of the bravest youths should be selected and that this numerous detachment the strength of the gallic army should instantly begin their march and exert their utmost diligence to arrive before the opening of the campaign on the frontiers of persia the minute interval which may be interposed between the byeme adulta and the primo vere of ammianus xx     instead of allowing a sufficient space for a march of three thousand miles would render the orders of constantius as extravagant as they were unjust the troops of gaul could not have reached syria till the end of autumn the memory of ammianus must have been inaccurate and his language incorrect  the caesar foresaw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate most of the auxiliaries who engaged their voluntary service had stipulated that they should never be obliged to pass the alps the public faith of rome and the personal honor of julian had been pledged for the observance of this condition such an act of treachery and oppression would destroy the confidence and excite the resentment of the independent warriors of germany who considered truth as the noblest of their virtues and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions the legionaries who enjoyed the title and privileges of romans were enlisted for the general defense of the republic but those mercenary troops heard with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and of rome attached either from birth or long habit to the climate and manners of gaul they loved and admired julian they despised and perhaps hated the emperor they dreaded the laborious march the persian arrows and the burning deserts of asia they claimed as their own the country which they had saved and excused their want of spirit by pleading the sacred and more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends the apprehensions of the gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger as soon as the provinces were exhausted of their military strength the germans would violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears and notwithstanding the abilities and valor of julian the general of a nominal army to whom the public calamities would be imputed must find himself after a vain resistance either a prisoner in the camp of the barbarians or a criminal in the palace of constantius if julian complied with the orders which he had received he subscribed his own destruction and that of a people who deserved his affection but a positive refusal was an act of rebellion and a declaration of war the inexorable jealousy of the emperor the peremptory and perhaps insidious nature of his commands left not any room for a fair apology or candid interpretation and the dependent station of the caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate solitude increased the perplexity of julian he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of sallust who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs he could not even enforce his representations by the concurrence of the ministers who would have been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of gaul the moment had been chosen when lupicinus ammianus xx   the valor of lupicinus and his military skill are acknowledged by the historian who in his affected language accuses the general of exalting the horns of his pride bellowing in a tragic tone and exciting a doubt whether he was more cruel or avaricious the danger from the scots and picts was so serious that julian himself had some thoughts of passing over into the island the general of the cavalry was dispatched into britain to repulse the inroads of the scots and picts and florentius was occupied at vienna by the assessment of the tribute the latter a crafty and corrupt statesman declining to assume a responsible part on this dangerous occasion eluded the pressing and repeated invitations of julian who represented to him that in every important measure the presence of the prefect was indispensable in the council of the prince in the mean while the caesar was oppressed by the rude and importunate solicitations of the imperial messengers who presumed to suggest that if he expected the return of his ministers he would charge himself with the guilt of the delay and reserve for them the merit of the execution unable to resist unwilling to comply julian expressed in the most serious terms his wish and even his intention of resigning the purple which he could not preserve with honor but which he could not abdicate with safety  after a painful conflict julian was compelled their discontents to acknowledge that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject and that the sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare he issued the necessary orders for carrying into execution the commands of constantius a part of the troops began their march for the alps and the detachments from the several garrisons moved toward their respective places of assembly they advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials who attempted to excite their pity by silent despair or loud lamentations while the wives of the soldiers holding their infants in their arms accused the desertion of their husbands in the mixed language of grief of tenderness and of indignation this scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of the caesar he granted a sufficient number of postwaggons to transport the wives and families of the soldiers he granted them the permission of the cursus clavularis or clabularis these postwaggons are often mentioned in the code and were supposed to carry fifteen hundred pounds weight see vales  d ammian xx    endeavored to alleviate the hardships which he was constrained to inflict and increased by the most laudable arts his own popularity and the discontent of the exiled troops the grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage their licentious murmurs which every hour were communicated from tent to tent with more boldness and effect prepared their minds for the most daring acts of sedition and by the connivance of their tribunes a seasonable libel was secretly dispersed which painted in lively colors the disgrace of the caesar the oppression of the gallic army and the feeble vices of the tyrant of asia the servants of constantius were astonished and alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit they pressed the caesar to hasten the departure of the troops but they imprudently rejected the honest and judicious advice of julian who proposed that they should not march through paris and suggested the danger and temptation of a last interview  as soon as the approach of the troops was they proclaim julian emporor announced the caesar went out to meet them and ascended his tribunal which had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city after distinguishing the officers and soldiers who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention julian addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding multitude he celebrated their exploits with grateful applause encouraged them to accept with alacrity the honor of serving under the eyes of a powerful and liberal monarch and admonished them that the commands of augustus required an instant and cheerful obedience the soldiers who were apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent clamor or of belying their sentiments by false and venal acclamations maintained an obstinate silence and after a short pause were dismissed to their quarters the principal officers were entertained by the caesar who professed in the warmest language of friendship his desire and his inability to reward according to their deserts the brave companions of his victories they retired from the feast full of grief and perplexity and lamented the hardship of their fate which tore them from their beloved general and their native country the only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly agitated and approved the popular resentment was insensibly molded into a regular conspiracy their just reasons of complaint were heightened by passion and their passions were inflamed by wine as on the eve of their departure the troops were indulged in licentious festivity at the hour of midnight the impetuous multitude with swords and bowls and torches in their hands rushed into the suburbs encompassed the palace most probably the palace of the baths thermarum of which a solid and lofty hall still subsists in the rue de la harp the buildings covered a considerable space of the modern quarter of the university and the gardens under the merovingian kings communicated with the abbey of st germain des prez by the injuries of time and the normans this ancient palace was reduced in the twelfth century to a maze of ruins whose dark recesses were the scene of licentious love  explicat aula sinus montemque amplectitur alis multiplici latebra scelerum tersura ruborem  pereuntis saepe pudoris celatura nefas venerisque accommoda furtis these lines are quoted from the architrenius l iv c   a poetical work of john de hauteville or hanville a monk of st albans about the year    0 see wartons history of english poetry vol i dissert ii yet such thefts might be less pernicious to mankind than the theological disputes of the sorbonne which have been since agitated on the same ground bonamy mem de lacademie tom xv p             and careless of future dangers pronounced the fatal and irrevocable words julian augustus the prince whose anxious suspense was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations secured the doors against their intrusion and as long as it was in his power secluded his person and dignity from the accidents of a nocturnal tumult at the dawn of day the soldiers whose zeal was irritated by opposition forcibly entered the palace seized with respectful violence the object of their choice guarded julian with drawn swords through the streets of paris placed him on the tribunal and with repeated shouts saluted him as their emperor prudence as well as loyalty inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable designs and of preparing for his oppressed virtue the excuse of violence addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals he sometimes implored their mercy and sometimes expressed his indignation conjured them not to fully the fame of their immortal victories and ventured to promise that if they would immediately return to their allegiance he would undertake to obtain from the emperor not only a free and gracious pardon but even the revocation of the orders which had excited their resentment but the soldiers who were conscious of their guilt chose rather to depend on the gratitude of julian than on the clemency of the emperor their zeal was insensibly turned into impatience and their impatience into rage the inflexible caesar sustained till the third hour of the day their prayers their reproaches and their menaces nor did he yield till he had been repeatedly assured that if he wished to live he must consent to reign he was exalted on a shield in the presence and amidst the unanimous acclamations of the troops a rich military collar which was offered by chance supplied the want of a diadem even in this tumultuous moment julian attended to the forms of superstitious ceremony and obstinately refused the inauspicious use of a female necklace or a horsecollar which the impatient soldiers would have employed in the room of a diadem  the ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative an equal proportion of gold and silver five pieces of the former one pound of the latter the whole amounting to about five pounds ten shillings of our money  and the new emperor overwhelmed with real or affected grief retired into the most secret recesses of his apartment for the whole narrative of this revolt we may appeal to authentic and original materials julian himself ad s p q atheniensem p             libanius orat parental c        in fabricius bibliot graec tom vii p          ammianus xx   and zosimus l iii p             who in the reign of julian appears to follow the more respectable authority of eunapius with such guides we might neglect the abbreviators and ecclesiastical historians   the grief of julian could proceed only from his innocence but his innocence must appear his protestations of innocence extremely doubtful eutropius a respectable witness uses a doubtful expression consensu militum x    gregory nazianzen whose ignorance might excuse his fanaticism directly charges the apostate with presumption madness and impious rebellion  orat iii p    in the eyes of those who have learned to suspect the motives and the professions of princes his lively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of hope and fear of gratitude and revenge of duty and of ambition of the love of fame and of the fear of reproach but it is impossible for us to calculate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments or to ascertain the principles of action which might escape the observation while they guided or rather impelled the steps of julian himself the discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion and if julian had tried to conceal a deep design under the appearances of chance he must have employed the most consummate artifice without necessity and probably without success he solemnly declares in the presence of jupiter of the sun of mars of minerva and of all the other deities that till the close of the evening which preceded his elevation he was utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers julian ad s p q athen p     the devout abbe de la bleterie vie de julien p     is almost inclined to respect the devout protestations of a pagan  and it may seem ungenerous to distrust the honor of a hero and the truth of a philosopher yet the superstitious confidence that constantius was the enemy and that he himself was the favorite of the gods might prompt him to desire to solicit and even to hasten the auspicious moment of his reign which was predestined to restore the ancient religion of mankind when julian had received the intelligence of the conspiracy he resigned himself to a short slumber and afterward related to his friends that he had seen the genius of the empire waiting with some impatience at his door pressing for admittance and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition ammian xx   with the note of lindenbrogius on the genius of the empire julian himself in a confidential letter to his friend and physician oribasius epist xvii p     mentions another dream to which before the event he gave credit of a stately tree thrown to the ground of a small plant striking a deep root into the earth even in his sleep the mind of the caesar must have been agitated by the hopes and fears of his fortune zosimus l iii p     relates a subsequent dream  astonished and perplexed he addressed his prayers to the great jupiter who immediately signified by a clear and manifest omen that he should submit to the will of heaven and of the army the conduct which disclaims the ordinary maxims of reason excites our suspicion and eludes our enquiry whenever the spirit of fanaticism at once so credulous and so crafty has insinuated itself into a noble mind it insensibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity  to moderate the zeal of his party to protect his embassy to constantius the persons of his enemies the difficult situation of the prince of a rebellious army is finely described by tacitus hist    0     but otho had much more guilt and much less abilities than julian  to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were formed against his life and dignity were the cares which employed the first days of the reign of the new emperor although he was firmly resolved to maintain the station which he had assumed he was still desirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war of declining a contest with the superior forces of constantius and of preserving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude adorned with the ensigns of military and imperial pomp julian showed himself in the field of mars to the soldiers who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil their leader and their friend he recapitulated their victories lamented their sufferings applauded their resolution animated their hopes and checked their impetuosity nor did he dismiss the assembly till he had obtained a solemn promise from the troops that if the emperor of the east would subscribe an equitable treaty they would renounce any views of conquest and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the gallic provinces on this foundation he composed in his own name and in that of the army a specious and moderate epistle to this ostensible epistle he added says ammianus private letters objurgatorias et mordaces which the historian had not seen and would not have published perhaps they never existed  which was delivered to pentadius his master of the offices and to his chamberlain eutherius two ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer and observe the dispositions of constantius this epistle is inscribed with the modest appellation of caesar but julian solicits in a peremptory though respectful manner the confirmation of the title of augustus he acknowledges the irregularity of his own election while he justifies in some measure the resentment and violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent he allows the supremacy of his brother constantius and engages to send him an annual present of spanish horses to recruit his army with a select number of barbarian youths and to accept from his choice a praetorian prefect of approved discretion and fidelity but he reserves for himself the nomination of his other civil and military officers with the troops the revenue and the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the alps he admonishes the emperor to consult the dictates of justice to distrust the arts of those venal flatterers who subsist only by the discord of princes and to embrace the offer of a fair and honorable treaty equally advantageous to the republic and to the house of constantine in this negotiation julian claimed no more than he already possessed the delegated authority which he had long exercised over the provinces of gaul spain and britain was still obeyed under a name more independent and august the soldiers and the people rejoiced in a revolution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty florentius was a fugitive lupicinus a prisoner the persons who were disaffected to the new government were disarmed and secured and the vacant offices were distributed according to the recommendation of merit by a prince who despised the

immediate action was recruited and augmented by the disorders of the times the cruel persecution of the faction of magnentius had filled gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers they cheerfully

ravage with impunity the frontiers of a divided empire the difficulty as well as glory of this enterprise consisted in a laborious march and julian had conquered as soon as he could penetrate into a

rocky peninsula almost encircled by the river doux once a magnificent city filled with temples etc now reduced to a small town emerging however from its ruins  which had severely suffered from their

detained by the tedious and affected delays of the provincial governors they were conducted by slow journies from constantinople to caesarea in cappadocia and when at length they were admitted to the presence of constantius they found that he had already conceived from the dispatches of his own officers the most unfavourable opinion of the conduct of julian and of the gallic army the letters were

julian and her mild influence might have moderated the resentment of a prince who since her death was abandoned to his own passions and to the arts of his eunuchs but the terror of a foreign invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a private enemy he continued his march toward the confines of persia and thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might entitle julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended sovereign he required that the presumptuous caesar should expressly renounce the appellation and rank of augustus which he had accepted from the rebels that he should descend to his former station of a limited and dependent minister that he should vest the powers of the state and army in the hands of those officers who were appointed by the imperial court and that he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon which were announced by epictetus a gallic bishop and one of the arian favorites of constantius several months were ineffectually consumed in a treaty which was negociated at the distance of three thousand miles between paris and antioch and as soon as julian perceived that his moderate and respectful behavior served only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil war he gave a public and military audience to the quaestor leonas the haughty epistle of constantius was read to the attentive multitude and julian protested with the most flattering deference that he was ready to resign the title of augustus if he could obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation the saint proposal was impetuously silenced and the acclamations of julian augustus continue to reign by the authority of the army of the people of the republic which you have saved thundered at once from every part of the field and terrified the pale ambassador of constantius a part of the letter was afterward read in which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of julian whom he had invested with the honors of the purple whom he had educated with so much care and tenderness whom he had preserved in his infancy when he was left a helpless orphan an orphan interrupted julian who justified his cause by indulging his passions does the assassin of my family reproach me that i was left an orphan he urges me to revenge those injuries which i have long studied to forget the assembly was dismissed and leonas who with some difficulty had been protected from the popular fury was sent back to his master with an epistle in which julian expressed in a strain of the most vehement eloquence the sentiments of contempt of hatred and of resentment which had been suppressed and embittered by the dissimulation of twenty years after this message which might be considered as a signal of irreconcilable war julian who some weeks before had celebrated the christian festival of the epiphany feriarum die quem

sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the monarch had again excited the barbarians to invade the provinces of the west the position of two magazines one of them collected on the banks of the lake of constance the other formed at the foot of the cottian alps seemed to indicate the march of two armies and the size of those magazines each of which consisted of six hundred thousand

the assembly of the soldiers inspired them with a just confidence in their general and in themselves and exhorted them to maintain their reputation of being terrible to the enemy moderate to their fellowcitizens and obedient to their officers his spirited discourse was received with the loudest acclamations and the same troops which had taken up arms against constantius when he summoned them to leave gaul now declared with alacrity that they would follow julian to the farthest extremities of europe or asia the oath of fidelity was administered and the soldiers clashing their shields and

honorable but useless sacrifice after losing one of his hands by the stroke of a sword he embraced the knees of the prince whom he had offended julian covered the prefect with his imperial mantle and protecting him from the zeal of his followers dismissed him to his own house with less respect than was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy he sternly refused his hand to the suppliant prefect whom

militaris rector alio quodam praeter merita suffragante ad potiorum veniat gradum ammian xx   absence did not weaken his regard for sallust with whose name a d     he honored the consulship   the hopes of julian depended much less on his march from the rhine into illyricum the number of his troops than on the celerity of his motions in the execution of a daring enterprise he availed himself of every precaution as far as prudence could suggest and where prudence could no longer accompany his steps he trusted the event to valor and to fortune in the neighborhood of basil he assembled and divided his army ammianus xxi   ascribes the same practice and the same motive to alexander the groat and other skilful generals  one body which consisted of ten thousand men was directed under the command of nevitta general of the cavalry to advance through the midland parts of rhaetia and noricum a similar division of troops under the orders of jovius and jovinus prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways through the alps and the northern confines of italy the instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and precision to hasten their march in close and compact columns

prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival to elude examination by their sudden departure to spread the opinion of their strength and the terror of his name and to join their sovereign under the walls of sirmium for himself julian had reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part he selected three thousand brave and active volunteers resolved like their leader to cast behind them every hope of a retreat at the head of this faithful band he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of the marcian or black forest which conceals the sources of the danube this wood was a part of the great hercynian forest which in the time of caesar stretched away from the country of the rauraci basil into the boundless regions of the north see cluver germania antiqua l iii c     and for many days the

mamertinus in panegyr vet xi       who accompanied julian as count of the sacred largesses describes this voyage in a florid and pictoresque manner challenges triptolemus and the argonauts of greece etc  and he had already disembarked his troops at bononia only nineteen miles from sirmium before his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the rhine in the course of this long and rapid navigation the mind of julian was fixed on the object of his enterprise and though he accepted the deputation of some cities which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission he passed before the hostile stations which were placed along the river without indulging the temptation of signalizing an useless and illtimed valor the banks of the danube were crowded on either side with spectators who gazed on the military pomp anticipated the importance of the event and diffused through the adjacent country the same of a young hero who advanced with more than mortal speed at the head of the innumerable forces of the west lucilian who with the rank of general of the cavalry commanded the military powers of illyricum was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports which he could neither reject nor believe he had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops when he was surprised by dagalaiphus an active officer whom julian as soon as he landed at bononia had pushed forwards with some light infantry the captive general uncertain of his life or death was hastily thrown upon a horse and conducted to the presence of julian who kindly raised him from the ground and dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupify his faculties but lucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits than he betrayed his want of discretion by presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly ventured with a handful of men to expose his person in the midst of his enemies reserve for your master constantius these timid remonstrances replied julian with a smile of contempt when i gave you my purple to kiss i received you not as a counselor but as a suppliant conscious that success alone could justify his attempt and that boldness only could command success he instantly advanced at the head of three thousand soldiers to attack the strongest and most populous city of the illyrian provinces as he entered the long suburb of sirmium he was received by the joyful acclamations of the army and people who crowned with flowers and holding lighted tapers in their hands conducted their acknowledged sovereign to his imperial residence two days were devoted to the public joy which was celebrated by the games of the circus but early on the morning of the third day julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of succi in the defiles of mount haemus which almost in the midway between sirmium and constantinople separates the provinces of thrace and dacia by an abrupt descent toward the former and a gentle declivity

praefectures of italy and illyricum were administered by taurus and florentius who united that important office with the vain honors of the consulship and as those magistrates had retired with precipitation to the court of asia julian who could not always restrain the levity of his temper stigmatized their flight by adding in all the acts of the year the epithet of fugitive to the names of the two consuls the provinces which had been deserted by their first magistrates acknowledged the authority of an emperor who conciliating the qualities of a soldier with those of a philosopher was equally admired in the camps of the danube and in the cities of greece from his palace or more properly from his headquarters of sirmium and naissus he distributed to the principal cities of the empire a labored apology for his own conduct published the secret dispatches of constantius and solicited the judgment of mankind between two competitors the one of whom had expelled and the other had invited the barbarians julian ad s p q athen p     positively asserts that he intercepted the letters of constantius to the barbarians and libanius as positively affirms that he read them on his march

constantius which supposes an intimate correspondence between them caesar tuus disciplinam non habet  julian whose mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude aspired to maintain by argument as well as by arms the superior merits of his cause and to excel not only in the arts of war but in those of composition his epistle to the senate and people of athens zosimus mentions his epistles to the athenians the corinthians and the lacedaemonians the substance was probably the same though the address was properly varied the epistle to the athenians is still extant p        and

have been dictated by an elegant enthusiasm which prompted him to submit his actions and his motives to the degenerate athenians of his own times with the same humble deference as if he had been pleading in the days of aristides before the tribunal of the areopagus his application to the senate of rome which was still permitted to bestow the titles of imperial power was agreeable to the forms of the expiring republic an assembly was summoned by tertullus prefect of the city the epistle of julian was read and as he appeared to be master of italy his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice his oblique censure of the innovations of constantine and his passionate invective against the vices of constantius were heard with less satisfaction and the senate as if julian had been present unanimously exclaimed respect we beseech you the author of your own fortune auctori tuo reverentiam rogamus ammian xxi  0 it is amusing enough to observe the secret conflicts of the senate between flattery and fear see tacit hist i     an artful expression which according to the chance of war might be differently explained as a manly reproof of the ingratitude of the usurper or as a flattering confession that a single act of such benefit to the state ought to atone for all the failings of constantius  the intelligence of the march and rapid progress of julian was speedily transmitted to his rival who by the retreat of sapor had obtained hostile preparations some respite from the persian war disguising the anguish of his soul under the semblance of contempt constantius professed his intention of returning into europe and of giving chase to julian for he never spoke of this military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting party tanquam venaticiam praedam caperet hoc enim ad leniendum suorum metum subinde praedicabat ammian xxi    in the camp of hierapolis in syria he communicated this design to his army slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the caesar and ventured to assure them that if the mutineers of gaul presumed to meet them in the field they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset the speech of the emperor was received with military applause and theodotus the president of the council of hierapolis requested with tears of adulation that his city might be adorned with the head of the vanquished rebel see the speech and preparations in ammianus xxi    the vile theodotus afterward implored and obtained his pardon from the merciful conqueror who signified his wish of diminishing his enemies and increasing the number of his friends xxii     a chosen detachment was dispatched away in postwaggons to secure if it were yet possible the pass of succi the recruits the horses the arms and the magazines which had been prepared against sapor were appropriated to the service of the civil war and the domestic victories of constantius inspired his partisans with the most sanguine assurances of success the notary gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of africa the subsistence of rome was intercepted and the distress of julian was increased by an unexpected event which might have been productive of fatal consequences julian had received the submission of two legions and a cohort of archers who were stationed at sirmium but he suspected with reason the fidelity of those troops which had been distinguished by the emperor and it was thought expedient under the pretense of the exposed state of the gallic frontier to dismiss them from the most important scene of action they advanced with reluctance as far as the confines of italy but as they dreaded the length of the way and the savage fierceness of the germans they resolved by the instigation of one of their tribunes to halt at aquileia and to erect the banners of constantius on the walls of that impregnable city the vigilance of julian perceived at once the extent of the mischief and the necessity of applying an immediate remedy by his order jovinus led back a part of the army into italy and the siege of aquileia was formed with diligence and prosecuted with vigor but the legionaries who seemed to have rejected the yoke of discipline conducted the defense of the place with skill and perseverance invited the rest of italy to imitate the example of their courage and loyalty and threatened the retreat of julian if he should be forced to yield to the superior numbers of the armies of the east ammian xxi         he seems to describe with superfluous labor the operations of the siege of aquileia which on this occasion maintained its impregnable fame gregory nazianzen orat iii p    ascribes this accidental revolt to the wisdom of constantius whose assured victory he announces with some appearance of truth constantio quem credebat proculdubio fore victorem nemo enim omnium tunc ab hac constanti sententia discrepebat ammian xxi     but the humanity of julian was preserved from the cruel alternative which he pathetically laments and death of constantius a d     nov   of destroying or of being himself destroyed and the seasonable death of constantius delivered the roman empire from the calamities of civil war the approach of winter could not detain the monarch at antioch and his favorites durst not oppose his impatient desire of revenge a slight fever which was perhaps occasioned by the agitation of his spirits was increased by the fatigues of the journey and constantius was obliged to halt at the little town of mopsucrene twelve miles beyond tarsus where he expired after a short illness in the fortyfifth year of his age and the twentyfourth of his reign his death and character are faithfully delineated by ammianus xxi          and we are authorized to despise and detest the foolish calumny of gregory orat iii p    who accuses julian of contriving the death of his benefactor the private repentance of the emperor that he had spared and promoted julian p    and orat xxi p     is not improbable in itself nor incompatible with the public verbal testament which prudential considerations might dictate in the last moments of his life  his genuine character which was composed of pride and weakness of superstition and cruelty has been fully displayed in the preceding narrative of civil and ecclesiastical events the long abuse of power rendered him a considerable object in the eyes of his contemporaries but as personal merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity the last of the sons of constantine may be dismissed from the world with the remark that he inherited the defects without the abilities of his father before constantius expired he is said to have named julian for his successor nor does it seem improbable that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and tender wife whom he left with child may have prevailed in his last moments over the harsher passions of hatred and revenge eusebius and his guilty associates made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs by the election of another emperor but their intrigues were rejected with disdain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil discord and two officers of rank were instantly dispatched to assure julian that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his service the military designs of that prince who had formed three different attacks against thrace were prevented by this fortunate event without shedding the blood of his fellowcitizens he escaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict and acquired the advantages of a complete victory impatient to visit the place of his birth and the new capital of the empire he advanced from naissus through the mountains of haemus and the cities of thrace when he reached heraclea at the distance of sixty miles all constantinople was poured forth to receive him and he made his triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations julian enters constantinople dec    of the soldiers the people and the senate an innumerable multitude pressed around him with eager respect and were perhaps disappointed when they beheld the small stature and simple garb of a hero whose unexperienced youth had vanquished the barbarians of germany and who had now traversed in a successful career the whole continent of europe from the shores of the atlantic to those of the bosphorus in describing the triumph of julian ammianus xxii     assumes the lofty tone of an orator or poet while libanius orat parent c    p     sinks to the grave simplicity of an historian a few days afterward when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the harbor the subjects of julian applauded the real or affected humanity of their sovereign on foot without his diadem and clothed in a mourning habit he accompanied the funeral as far as the church of the holy apostles where the body was deposited and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth and dignity of his imperial kinsman the tears of julian professed to the world that he had forgot the injuries and remembered only the obligations which he had received from constantius the funeral of constantius is described by ammianus xxi    gregory nazianzen orat iv p     mamertinus in panegyr vet xi    libanius orat parent c lvi p     and philostorgius l vi c   with godefroys dissertations p     these writers and their followers pagans catholics arians beheld with very different eyes both the dead and the living emperor as soon as the legions of aquileia were assured of the death of the emperor they opened the gates of the city and by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders obtained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of julian who in the thirtysecond year of his and is acknowledged by the whole empire age acquired the undisputed possession of the roman empire the day and year of the birth of julian are not perfectly ascertained the day is probably the sixth of november and the year must be either     or     tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p     ducange fam byzantin p  0 i have preferred the earlier date   philosophy had instructed julian to compare his civil government and private life the advantages of action and retirement but the elevation of his birth and the accidents of his life never allowed him the freedom of choice he might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the academy and the society of athens but he was constrained at first by the will and afterward by the injustice of constantius to expose his person and fame to the dangers of imperial greatness and to make himself accountable to the world and to posterity for the happiness of millions julian himself p          has expressed these philosophical ideas with much eloquence and some affectation in a very elaborate epistle to themistius the abbe de la bleterie tom ii p          who has given an elegant translation is inclined to believe that it was the celebrated themistius whose orations are still extant julian recollected with terror the observation of his master plato julian ad themist p     petavius not p    observes that this assage is taken from the fourth book de legibus but either julian quoted from memory or his mss were different from ours xenophon opens the cyropaedia with a similar reflection that the government of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings of a superior species and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the celestial powers of the gods or of the genii from this principle he justly concluded that the man who presumes to reign should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature that he should purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part that he should extinguish his appetites enlighten his understanding regulate his passions and subdue the wild beast which according to the lively metaphor of aristotle  aristot ap julian p     the ms of vossius unsatisfied with a single beast affords the stronger reading of  which the experience of despotism may warrant seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot the throne of julian which the death of constantius fixed on an independent basis was the seat of reason of virtue and perhaps of vanity he despised the honors renounced the pleasures and discharged with incessant diligence the duties of his exalted station and there were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem had they been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the rigorous laws which their philosophic emperor imposed on himself one of his most intimate friends libanius orat parentalis c lxxxiv lxxxv p   0         has given this interesting detail of the private life of julian he himself in misopogon p   0 mentions his vegetable diet and upbraids the gross and sensual appetite of the people of antioch who had often shared the frugal simplicity of his table has remarked that his light and sparing diet which was usually of the vegetable kind left his mind and body always free and active for the various and important business of an author a pontiff a magistrate a general and a prince in one and the same day he gave audience to several ambassadors and wrote or dictated a great number of letters to his generals his civil magistrates his private friends and the different cities of his dominions he listened to the memorials which had been received considered the subject of the petitions and signified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in shorthand by the diligence of his secretaries he possessed such flexibility of thought and such firmness of attention that he could employ his hand to write his ear to listen and his voice to dictate and pursue at once three several trains of ideas without hesitation and without error while his ministers reposed the prince flew with agility from one labor to another and after a hasty dinner retired into his library till the public business which he had appointed for the evening summoned him to interrupt the prosecution of his studies the supper of the emperor was still less substantial than the former meal his sleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigestion and except in the short interval of a marriage which was the effect of policy rather than love the chaste julian never shared his bed with a female companion lectulus vestalium toris

and ingenuity he was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries who had slept the preceding day and his servants were obliged to wait alternately while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of occupations the predecessors of julian his uncle his brother and his cousin indulged their puerile taste for the games of the circus under the specious pretense of complying with the inclinations of the people and they frequently remained the greatest part of the day as idle spectators and as a part of the splendid spectacle till the ordinary round of twentyfour races see salmasius ad sueton in claud c xxi a twentyfifth race or missus was added to complete the number of one hundred chariots four of which the four colors started

condescended to appear in the circus and after bestowing a careless glance on five or six of the races he hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher who considered every moment as lost that

of the palace one of the first and most necessary acts of the government of julian the reformation of the palace is described by ammianus xxii   libanius orat parent c lxii p     etc mamertinus in panegyr vet xi    socrates l iii c   and zonaras tom ii l xiii p     soon after his entrance into the palace of constantinople he had occasion for the service of a barber an officer magnificently dressed immediately presented himself it is a barber exclaimed the prince with affected surprise that i want and not a receivergeneral of the finances ego non rationalem jussi sed tonsorem acciri zonaras uses the less natural image of a senator yet an officer of the finances who was satiated with wealth might desire and obtain the honors of the senate  he questioned the man concerning the profits of his employment and was informed that besides a large salary and some valuable perquisites he enjoyed a daily allowance for twenty servants and as many horses a thousand barbers a thousand cupbearers a thousand cooks were distributed in the several offices of luxury and the number of eunuchs could be compared only with the insects of a summers day  are the original words of libanius which i have faithfully quoted lest i should be suspected of magnifying the abuses of the royal household  the monarch who resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue was distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress his table his buildings and his train the stately palaces erected by constantine and his sons were decorated with many colored marbles and ornaments of massy gold the most exquisite dainties were procured to gratify their pride rather than their taste birds of the most distant climates fish from the most remote seas fruits out of their natural season winter roses and summer snows the expressions of mamertinus are lively and forcible quin etiam prandiorum et caenarum laboratas magnitudines romanus populus sensit cum quaesitissimae dapes non gustu sed difficultatibus aestimarentur miracula avium longinqui maris pisces alieni temporis poma aestivae nives hybernae rosae  the domestic crowd of the palace surpassed the expense of the legions yet the smallest part of this costly multitude was subservient to the use or even to the splendour of the throne the monarch was disgraced and the people was injured by the creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure and even titular employments and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of being maintained without the necessity of labor from the public revenue the waste of an enormous household the increase of fees and perquisites which were soon claimed as a lawful debt and the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity or solicited their favor suddenly enriched these haughty menials they abused their fortune without considering their past or their future condition and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations their silken robes were embroidered with gold their tables were served with delicacy and profusion the houses which they built for their own use would have covered the farm of an ancient consul and the most honorable citizens were obliged to dismount from their horses and respectfully to salute an eunuch whom they met on the public highway the luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of julian who usually slept on the ground who yielded with reluctance to the indispensable calls of nature and who placed his vanity not in emulating but in despising the pomp of royalty by the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond its real extent he was impatient to relieve the distress and to appease the murmurs of the people who support with less uneasiness the weight of taxes if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry are appropriated to the service of the state but in the execution of this salutary work julian is accused of proceeding with too much haste and inconsiderate severity by a single edict he reduced the palace of constantinople to an immense desert and dismissed with ignominy the whole train of slaves and dependents yet julian himself was accused of bestowing whole towns on the eunuchs orat vii against polyclet p          libanius contents himself with a cold but positive denial of the fact which seems indeed to belong more properly to constantius this charge however may allude to some unknown circumstance  without providing any just or at least benevolent exceptions for the age the services or the poverty of the faithful domestics of the imperial family such indeed was the temper of julian who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim of aristotle that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between the opposite vices the splendid and effeminate dress of the asiatics the curls and paint the collars and bracelets which had appeared so ridiculous in the person of constantine were consistently rejected by his philosophic successor but with the sopperies julian affected to renounce the decencies of dress and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the laws of cleanliness in a satirical performance which was designed for the public eye the emperor descants with pleasure and even with pride on the length of his nails and the inky blackness of his hands protests that although the greatest part of his body was covered with hair the use of the razor was confined to his head alone and celebrates with visible complacency the shaggy and populous in the misopogon p         he draws a very singular picture of himself and the following words are strangely characteristic  the friends of the abbe de la bleterie adjured him in the name of the french nation not to translate this passage so offensive to their delicacy hist de jovien tom ii p    like him i have contented myself with a transient allusion but the little animal which julian names is a beast samiliar to man and signifies love beard which he fondly cherished after the example of the philosophers of greece had julian consulted the simple dictates of reason the first magistrate of the romans would have scorned the affectation of diogenes as well as that of darius  but the work of public reformation would chamber of justice have remained imperfect if julian had only corrected the abuses without punishing the crimes of his predecessors reign we are now delivered says he in a familiar letter to one of his intimate friends we are now surprisingly delivered from the voracious jaws of the hydra julian epist xxiii p     he uses the words  in writing to his friend hermogenes who like himself was conversant with the greek poets  i do not mean to apply that epithet to my brother constantius he is no more may the earth lie light on his head but his artful and cruel favorites studied to deceive and exasperate a prince whose natural mildness cannot be praised without some efforts of adulation it is not however my intention that even those men should be oppressed they are accused and they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial to conduct this enquiry julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state and army and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning his personal enemies he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at chalcedon on the asiatic side of the bosphorus and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence without delay and without appeal the office of president was exercised by the venerable prefect of the east a second sallust the two sallusts the prefect of gaul and the prefect of the east must be carefully distinguished hist des empereurs tom iv p     i have

overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four generals nevitta agilo jovinus and arbetio arbetio whom the public would have seen with less surprise at the bar than on the bench was supposed to possess the secret of the commission the armed and angry leaders of the jovian and herculian bands encompassed the tribunal and the judges were alternately swayed by the laws of justice and by the clamours of faction the proceedings of this chamber of justice are related by ammianus xxii   and praised by libanius orat parent c    p      00   the chamberlain eusebius who had so long punishment of the innocent and the guilty abused the favor of constantius expiated by an ignominious death the insolence the corruption and cruelty of his servile reign the executions of paul and apodemius the former of whom was burnt alive were accepted as an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of so many hundred romans whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and murdered but justice herself if we may use the pathetic expression of ammianus ursuli vero necem ipsa mihi videtur flesse justitia libanius who imputes his death to the soldiers attempts to criminate the count of the largesses  appeared to weep over the fate of ursulus the treasurer of the empire and his blood accused the ingratitude of julian whose distress had been seasonably relieved by the intrepid liberality of that honest minister the rage of the soldiers whom he had provoked by his indiscretion was the cause and the excuse of his death and the emperor deeply wounded by his own reproaches and those of the public offered some consolation to the family of ursulus by the restitution of his consiscated fortunes before the end of the year in which they had been adorned with the ensigns of the prefecture and consulship such respect was still entertained for the venerable names of the commonwealth that the public was surprised and scandalized to hear taurus summoned as a criminal under the consulship of taurus the summons of his colleague florentius was probably delayed till the commencement of the ensuing year  taurus and florentius were reduced to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of chalcedon the former was banished to vercellae in italy and a sentence of death was pronounced against the latter a wise prince should have rewarded the crime of taurus the faithful minister when he was no longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel had taken refuge in the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign but the guilt of florentius justified the severity of the judges and his escape served to display the magnanimity of julian who nobly checked the interested diligence of an informer and refused to learn what place concealed the wretched fugitive from his just resentment ammian xx    some months after the tribunal of chalcedon had been dissolved the praetorian vicegerent of africa the notary gaudentius and artemius for the guilt and punishment of artemius see julian epist x p     and ammianus xxii   and vales ad loc the merit of artemius who demolished temples and was put to death by an apostate has tempted the greek and latin churches to honor him as a martyr

executed at antioch artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant of a great province gaudentius had long practiced the arts of calumny against the innocent the virtuous and even the person of julian himself yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were so unskilfully managed that these wicked men obtained in the public opinion the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of constantius the rest of his servants were protected by a general act of oblivion and they were left to enjoy with impunity the bribes which they had accepted either to defend the oppressed or to oppress the friendless this measure which on the soundest principles of policy may deserve our approbation was executed in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne julian was tormented by the importunities of a multitude particularly of egyptians who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently or illegally bestowed he foresaw the endless prosecution of vexatious suits and he engaged a promise which ought always to have been sacred that if they would repair to chalcedon he would meet them in person to hear and determine their complaints but as soon as they were landed he issued an absolute order which prohibited the watermen from transporting any egyptian to constantinople and thus detained his disappointed clients on the asiatic shore till their patience and money being utterly exhausted they were obliged to return with indignant murmurs to their native country see ammian xxii   and vales ad locum and the codex theodosianus l ii tit xxxix leg   and godefroys commentary tom i p     ad locum   the numerous army of spies of agents and clemency of julian informers enlisted by constantius to secure the repose of one man and to interrupt that of millions was immediately disbanded by his generous successor julian was slow in his suspicions and gentle in his punishments and his contempt of treason was the result of judgment of vanity and of courage conscious of superior merit he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare to meet him in the field to attempt his life or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne the philosopher could excuse the hasty sallies of discontent and the hero could despise the ambitious projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash conspirators a citizen of ancyra had prepared for his own use a purple garment and this indiscreet action which under the reign of constantius would have been considered as a capital offense the president montesquieu considerations sur la grandeur etc des romans c xiv in his works tom iii p         excuses this minute and absurd tyranny by supposing that actions the most indifferent in our eyes might excite in a roman mind the idea of guilt and danger this strange apology is supported by a strange misapprehension of the english laws chez une nation ou il est defendu de boire a la sante dune certain person  was reported to julian by the officious importunity of a private enemy the monarch after making some inquiry into the rank and character of his rival dispatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple slippers to complete the magnificence of his imperial habit a more dangerous conspiracy was formed by ten of the domestic guards who had resolved to assassinate julian in the field of exercise near antioch their intemperance revealed their guilt and they were conducted in chains to the presence of their injured sovereign who after a lively representation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise instead of a death of torture which they deserved and expected pronounced a sentence of exile against the two principal offenders the only instance in which julian seemed to depart from his accustomed clemency was the execution of a rash youth who with a feeble hand had aspired to seize the reins of empire but that youth was the son of marcellus the general of cavalry who in the first campaign of the gallic war had deserted the standard of the caesar and the republic without appearing to indulge his personal resentment julian might easily confound the crime of the son and of the father but he was reconciled by the distress of marcellus and the liberality of the emperor endeavored to heal the wound which had been inflicted by the hand of justice the clemency of julian and the conspiracy which was formed against his life at antioch are described by ammianus xxii    0 and vales ad loc and libanius orat parent c    p       julian was not insensible of the advantages of his love of freedom and the republic freedom according to some says aristotle as he is quoted by julian ad themist p     the form of absolute government the  is contrary to nature both the prince and the philosopher choose however to involve this eternal truth in artful and labored obscurity  from his studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and heroes his life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a tyrant and when he ascended the throne his pride was sometimes mortified by the reflection that the slaves who would not dare to censure his defects were not worthy to applaud his virtues that sentiment is expressed almost in the words of julian himself ammian xxii  0  he sincerely abhorred the system of oriental despotism which diocletian constantine and the patient habits of fourscore years had established in the empire a motive of superstition prevented the execution of the design which julian had frequently meditated of relieving his head from the weight of a costly diadem libanius orat parent c    p   0 who mentions the wish and design of julian insinuates in mysterious language  that the emperor was restrained by some particular revelation  but he absolutely refused the title of dominus or lord julian in misopogon p     as he never abolished by any public law the proud appellations of despot or dominus they are still extant on his medals ducange fam byzantin p       and the private displeasure which he affected to express only gave a different tone to the servility of the court the abbe de la bleterie hist de jovien tom ii p      0  has curiously traced the origin and progress of the word dominus under the imperial government  a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the romans that they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating origin the office or rather the name of consul was cherished by a prince who contemplated with reverence the ruins of the republic and the same behavior which had been assumed by the prudence of augustus was adopted by julian from choice and inclination on the calends of a d     jan   january at break of day the new consuls mamertinus and nevitta hastened to the palace to salute the emperor as soon as he was informed of their approach he leaped from his throne eagerly advanced to meet them and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the demonstrations of his affected humility from the palace they proceeded to the senate the emperor on foot marched before their litters and the gazing multitude admired the image of ancient times or secretly blamed a conduct which in their eyes degraded the majesty of the purple ammian xxii   the consul mamertinus in panegyr vet xi        0 celebrates the auspicious day like an eloquent slave astonished and intoxicated by the condescension of his master  but the behavior of julian was uniformly supported during the games of the circus he had imprudently or designedly performed the manumission of a slave in the presence of the consul the moment he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of another magistrate he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the world that he was subject like the rest of his fellowcitizens to the laws personal satire was condemned by the laws of the twelve tables si male condiderit in quem quis carmina jus est judiciumque  julian in misopogon p     owns himself subject to the law and the abbe de la bleterie hist de jovien tom ii p    has eagerly embraced a declaration so agreeable to his own system and indeed to the true spirit of the imperial constitution    and even to the forms of the republic the spirit of his administration and his regard for the place of his nativity induced julian to confer on the senate of constantinople the same honors privileges and authority which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient rome zosimus l iii p      a legal fiction was introduced and gradually established that one half of the national council had migrated into the east and the despotic successors of julian accepting the title of senators acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body which was permitted to represent the majesty of the roman name from constantinople the attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of the provinces he abolished by repeated edicts the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the service of their country and by imposing an equal distribution of public duties he restored the strength the splendor or according to the glowing expression of libanius  see libanius orat parent c    p     ammianus xxii   and the theodosian code l

empire  the soul of the expiring cities of his empire the venerable age of greece excited his care of the grecian cities the most tender compassion in the mind of julian which kindled into rapture when he recollected the gods the heroes and the men superior to heroes and to gods who had bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of their genius or the example of their virtues he relieved the distress and restored the beauty of the cities of epirus and peloponnesus quae paulo ante arida et siti anhelantia visebantur ea nunc perlui mundari madere fora deambulacra gymnasia laetis et

of delphi and of argos which had inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the olympic the pythian and the nemean games claimed a just exemption the immunity of elis and delphi was respected by the corinthians but the poverty of argos tempted the insolence of oppression and the feeble complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in which he resided seven years after this sentence julian julian epist xxxv p  0     this epistle which illustrates the declining age of greece is omitted by the abbe de la bleterie and strangely disfigured by the latin translator who by rendering  tributum and  populus directly contradicts the sense of the original allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal and his eloquence was interposed most probably with success in the defense of a city which had been the royal seat of agamemnon he reigned in mycenae at the

  the laborious administration of military and civil affairs which were multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire exercised the abilities julian an orator and a judge of julian but he frequently assumed the two characters of orator his eloquence is celebrated by libanius orat parent c       p  00  0  who distinctly mentions the orators of homer socrates l iii c   has rashly asserted that julian was the only prince since julius caesar who harangued the senate all the predecessors of nero tacit annal xiii   and many of his successors possessed the faculty of speaking in public and it might be proved by various examples that they frequently exercised it in the senate and of judge ammianus xxii  0 has impartially stated the merits and defects of his judicial proceedings libanius orat parent c  0    p     etc has seen only the fair side and his picture if it flatters the person expresses at least the duties of the judge gregory nazianzen orat iv p   0 who suppresses the virtues and exaggerates even the venial faults of the apostate triumphantly asks whether such a judge was fit to be seated between minos and rhadamanthus in the elysian fields  which are almost unknown to the modern sovereigns of europe the arts of persuasion so diligently cultivated by the first caesars were neglected by the military ignorance and asiatic pride of their successors and if they condescended to harangue the soldiers whom they feared they treated with silent disdain the senators whom they despised the assemblies of the senate which constantius had avoided were considered by julian as the place where he could exhibit with the most propriety the maxims of a republican and the talents of a rhetorician he alternately practiced as in a school of declamation the several modes of praise of censure of exhortation and his friend libanius has remarked that the study of homer taught him to imitate the simple concise style of menelaus the copiousness of nestor whose words descended like the flakes of a winters snow or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of ulysses the functions of a judge which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince were exercised by julian not only as a duty but as an amusement and although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his praetorian prefects he often placed himself by their side on the seat of judgment the acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates who labored to disguise the truth of facts and to pervert the sense of the laws he sometimes forgot the gravity of his station asked indiscreet or unseasonable questions and betrayed by the loudness of his voice and the agitation of his body the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion against the judges the advocates and their clients but his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage and even to solicit the reproof of his friends and ministers and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions the spectators could observe the shame as well as the gratitude of their monarch the decrees of julian were almost always founded on the principles of justice and he had the firmness to resist the two most dangerous temptations which assault the tribunal of a sovereign under the specious forms of compassion and equity he decided the merits of the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties and the poor whom he wished to relieve were condemned to satisfy the just demands of a noble and wealthy adversary he carefully distinguished the judge from the legislator of the laws which julian enacted in a reign of sixteen months fiftyfour have been admitted into the codes of theodosius and justinian gothofred chron legum p        the abbe de la bleterie tom ii p          has chosen one of these laws to give an idea of julians latin style which is forcible and elaborate but less pure than his greek  and though he meditated a necessary reformation of the roman jurisprudence he pronounced sentence according to the strict and literal interpretation of those laws which the magistrates were bound to execute and the subjects to obey  the generality of princes if they were stripped his character of their purple and cast naked into the world would immediately sink to the lowest rank of society without a hope of emerging from their obscurity but the personal merit of julian was in some measure independent of his fortune whatever had been his choice of life by the force of intrepid courage lively wit and intense application he would have obtained or at least he would have deserved the highest honors of his profession and julian might have raised himself to the rank of minister or general of the state in which he was born a private citizen if the jealous caprice of power had disappointed his expectations if he had prudently declined the paths of greatness the employment of the same talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the reach of kings his present happiness and his immortal fame when we inspect with minute or perhaps malevolent attention the portrait of julian something seems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure his genius was less powerful and sublime than that of caesar nor did he possess the consummate prudence of augustus the virtues of trajan appear more steady and natural and the philosophy of marcus is more simple and consistent yet julian sustained adversity with firmness and prosperity with moderation after an interval of one hundred and twenty years from the death of alexander severus the romans beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his duties and his pleasures who labored to relieve the distress and to revive the spirit of his subjects and who endeavored always to connect authority with merit and happiness with virtue even faction and religious faction was constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius in peace as well as in war and to confess with a sigh that the apostate julian was a lover of his country and that he deserved the empire of the world

reputation of julian and the enthusiasm which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the religion of julian real and apparent magnitude of his faults our partial ignorance may represent him as a philosophic monarch who studied to protect with an equal hand the religious factions of the empire and to allay the theological fever which had inflamed the minds of the people from the edicts of diocletian to the exile of athanasius a more accurate view of the character and conduct of julian will remove this favorable prepossession for a prince who did not escape the general contagion of the times we enjoy the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fondest admirers and his implacable enemies the actions of julian are faithfully related by a judicious and candid historian the impartial spectator of his life and death the unanimous evidence of his contemporaries is confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor himself and his various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious sentiments which policy would have prompted him to dissemble rather than to affect a devout and sincere attachment for the gods of athens and rome constituted the ruling passion of julian i shall transcribe some of his own expressions from a short religious discourse which the imperial pontiff composed to censure the bold impiety of a cynic  orat vii p     the variety and copiousness of the greek tongue seems inadequate to the fervor of his devotion  the powers of an enlightened understanding were betrayed and corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice and the phantoms which existed only in the mind of the emperor had a real and pernicious effect on the government of the empire the vehement zeal of the christians who despised the worship and overturned the altars of those fabulous deities engaged their votary in a state of irreconcilable hostility with a very numerous party of his subjects and he was sometimes tempted by the desire of victory or the shame of a repulse to violate the laws of prudence and even of justice the triumph of the party which he deserted and opposed has fixed a stain of infamy on the name of julian and the unsuccessful apostate has been overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives of which the signal was given by the sonorous trumpet the orator with some eloquence much enthusiasm and more vanity addresses his discourse to heaven and earth to men and angels to the living and the dead and above all to the great constantius  an odd pagan expression he concludes with a bold assurance that he has erected a monument not less durable and much more portable than the columns of hercules see greg nazianzen orat iii p  0 iv p      of gregory nazianzen see this long

lions       the interesting nature of the events which were crowded into the short reign of this active emperor deserve a just and circumstantial narrative his motives his counsels and his actions as far as they are connected with the history of religion will be the subject of the present chapter  the cause of his strange and fatal apostasy his education and apostasy may be derived from the early period of his life when he was left an orphan in the hands of the murderers of his family the names of christ and of constantius the ideas of slavery and of religion were soon associated in a youthful imagination which was susceptible of the most lively impressions the care of his infancy was entrusted to eusebius bishop of nicomedia nicomediae ab eusebio educatus episcopo quem genere longius contingebat ammian xxii   julian never expresses any gratitude toward that arian prelate but he celebrates his preceptor the eunuch mardonius and describes his mode of education which inspired his pupil with a passionate admiration for the genius and perhaps the religion of homer misopogon p          who was related to him on the side of his mother and till julian reached the twentieth year of his age he received from his christian preceptors the education not of a hero but of a saint the emperor less jealous of a heavenly than of an earthly crown contented himself with the imperfect character of a catechumen while he bestowed the advantages of baptism greg naz iii p  0 he labored to efface that holy mark in the blood perhaps of a taurobolium baron annal eccles a d     no     on

fairest fruits of faith and devotion see his christian and even eccleslastical education in gregory iii p    socrates l iii c   and sozomen l v c   he escaped very narrowly from being a bishop and perhaps a saint  they prayed they fasted they distributed alms to the poor gifts to the clergy and oblations to the tombs of the martyrs and the splendid monument of st mamas at caesarea was erected

subverted the structures which were imposed by the sacrilegious hand of julian greg iii p     0    such a partial earthquake attested by many living spectators would form one of the clearest miracles

the voluntary hardships of the ascetic life the philosopher fragment p     ridicules the ironchains etc of these solitary fanatics see tillemont mem eccles tom ix p         who had forgot that man is by nature a gentle and social animal  the pagan supposes that because they had renounced the gods they were possessed and tormented by evil demons  as the two princes advanced toward the years of manhood they discovered in their religious sentiments the difference of their characters the dull and obstinate understanding of gallus embraced with implicit zeal the doctrines of christianity which never influenced his conduct or moderated his passions the mild disposition of the younger brother was less repugnant to the precepts of the gospel and his active curiosity might have been gratified by a theological system which explains the mysterious essence of the deity and opens the boundless prospect of invisible and future worlds but the independent spirit of julian refused to yield the passive and unresisting obedience which was required in the name of religion by the haughty ministers of the church their speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws and guarded by the terrors

maintains that the christian trinity is not derived from the doctrine of paul of jesus or of moses  the fierce contests of the eastern bishops the incessant alterations of their creeds and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct insensibly strengthened the prejudice of julian that they neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so fiercely contended instead of listening to the proofs of christianity with that favorable attention which adds weight to the most respectable evidence he heard with suspicion and disputed with obstinacy and acuteness the doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible aversion whenever the young princes were directed to compose declamations on the subject of the prevailing controversies julian always declared himself the advocare of paganism under the specious excuse that in the defense of the weaker cause his learning and ingenuity might be more advantageously exercised and displayed  as soon as gallus was

of apollo and the muses the deities of olympus as they are painted by the immortal bard imprint themselves on the minds which are the least addicted to superstitious credulity our familiar knowledge of their names and characters their forms and attributes seems to bestow on those airy beings a real and substantial existence and the pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent of the imagination to those fables which are the most repugnant to our reason and experience in the age of julian every circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify the illusion the magnificent temples of greece and asia the works of those artists who had expressed in painting or in sculpture the divine conceptions of the poet the pomp of festivals and sacrifices the successful arts of divination the popular traditions of oracles and prodigies and the ancient practice of two thousand years the weakness of polytheism was in some measure excused by the moderation of its claims and the devotion of the pagans was not incompatible with the most licentious skepticism a modern philosopher has ingeniously compared the different operation of theism and polytheism with regard to the doubt or conviction which they produce in the human mind see humes essays vol ii p        in  vo edit       instead of an indivisible and regular system which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind the mythology of the greeks was composed of a thousand loose and flexible parts and the servant of the gods was at liberty to define the degree and measure of his religious faith the creed which julian adopted for his own use was of the largest dimensions and by a strange contradiction he disdained the salutary yoke of the gospel whilst he made a voluntary offering of his reason on the altars of jupiter and apollo one of the orations of julian is consecrated to the honor of cybele the mother of the gods who required from her effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice so rashly performed by the madness of the phrygian boy the pious emperor condescends to relate without a blush and without a smile the voyage of the goddess from the shores of pergamus to the mouth of the tyber and the stupendous miracle which convinced the senate and people of rome that the lump of clay which their ambassadors had transported over the seas was endowed with life and sentiment and divine power the

the quirinal hill and pities the strange blindness of the christians who preferred the cross to these celestial trophies apud cyril l vi p       but the devout philosopher who sincerely embraced and warmly encouraged the superstition of the people reserved for himself the privilege of a liberal interpretation and silently withdrew from the foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple the extravagance of the grecian mythology proclaimed with a clear and audible voice that the pious enquirer instead of being scandalized or satisfied with the literal sense should diligently explore the occult wisdom which had been disguised by the prudence of antiquity under the mask of folly and of fable see the principles of allegory in julian orat vii p         his reasoning is less absurd than that of some modern theologians who assert that an extravagant or contradictory doctrine must be divine since no man alive could have thought of inventing it  the philosophers of the platonic school eunapius has made these sophists the subject of a partial and fanatical history and the learned brucker hist philosoph tom ii p     0  has employed much labor to illustrate their obscure lives and incomprehensible doctrines  plotinus porphyry and the divine iamblichus were admired as the most skilful masters of this allegorical science which labored to soften and harmonize the deformed features of paganism julian himself who was directed in the mysterious pursuit by aedesius the venerable successor of iamblichus aspired to the possession of a treasure which he esteemed if we may credit his solemn asseverations far above the empire of the world julian orat vii p     he swears with the most fervent and enthusiastic devotion and trembles lest he should betray too much of these holy mysteries which the profane might deride with an impious sardonic laugh  it was indeed a treasure which derived its value only from opinion and every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the precious ore from the surrounding dross claimed an equal right of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his peculiar fancy the fable of atys and cybele had been already explained by porphyry but his labors served only to animate the pious industry of julian who invented and published his own allegory of that ancient and mystic tale this freedom of interpretation which might gratify the pride of the platonists exposed the vanity of their art without a tedious detail the modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange allusions the forced etymologies the solemn trifling and the impenetrable obscurity of these sages who professed to reveal the system of the universe as the traditions of pagan mythology were variously related the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select the most convenient circumstances and as they translated an arbitrary cipher they could extract from any fable any sense which was adapted to their favorite system of religion and philosophy the lascivious form of a naked venus was tortured into the discovery of some moral precept or some physical truth and the castration of atys explained the revolution of the sun between the tropics or the separation of the human soul from vice and error see the fifth oration of julian but all the allegories which ever issued from the platonic school are not worth the short poem of catullus on the same extraordinary subject the transition of atys from the wildest enthusiasm to sober pathetic complaint for his irretrievable loss must inspire a man with pity an eunuch with despair   the theological system of julian appears to have contained the sublime and important principles theological system of julian of natural religion but as the faith which is not founded on revelation must remain destitute of any firm assurance the disciple of plato imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar superstition and the popular and philosophic notion of the deity seems to have been confounded in the practice the writings and even in the mind of julian the true religion of julian may be deduced from the caesars p  0  with spanheims notes and illustrations from the fragments in cyril l ii p       and especially from the theological oration in solemn regem p   0      addressed in the confidence of friendship to the prefect sallust  the pious emperor acknowledged and adored the eternal cause of the universe to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an infinite nature invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the understanding of feeble mortals the supreme god had created or rather in the platonic language had generated the gradual succession of dependent spirits of gods of demons of heroes and of men and every being which derived its existence immediately from the first cause received the inherent gift of immortality that so precious an advantage might not be lavished upon unworthy objects the creator had entrusted to the skill and power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms to the conduct of these divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this lower world but their imperfect administration is not exempt from discord or error the earth and its inhabitants are divided among them and the characters of mars or minerva of mercury or venus may be distinctly traced in the laws and manners of their peculiar votaries as long as our immortal souls are confined in a mortal prison it is our interest as well as our duty to solicit the favor and to deprecate the wrath of the powers of heaven whose pride is gratified by the devotion of mankind and whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some nourishment from the fumes of sacrifice julian adopts this gross conception by ascribing it to his favorite marcus antoninus caesares p     the stoics and platonists hesitated between the analogy of bodies and the purity of spirits yet the gravest philosophers inclined to the whimsical fancy of aristophanes and lucian that an unbelieving age might starve the immortal gods see observations de spanheim p         etc  the inferior gods might sometimes condescend to animate the statues and to inhabit the temples which were dedicated to their honor they might occasionally visit the earth but the heavens were the proper throne and symbol of their glory the invariable order of the sun moon and stars was hastily admitted by julian as a proof of their eternal duration and their eternity was a sufficient evidence that they were the workmanship not of an inferior deity but of the omnipotent king in the system of the platonists the visible was a type of the invisible world the celestial bodies as they were informed by a divine spirit might be considered as the objects the most worthy of religious worship the sun whose genial influence pervades and sustains the universe justly claimed the adoration of mankind as the bright representative of the logos the lively the rational the beneficent image of the intellectual father  julian epist xli in another place apud cyril l ii p    he calls the sun god and the throne of god julian believed the platonician trinity and only blames the christians for preferring a mortal to an immortal logos   in every age the absence of genuine inspiration fanaticism of the philosophers is supplied by the strong illusions of enthusiasm and the mimic arts of imposture if in the time of julian these arts had been practiced only by the pagan priests for the support of an expiring cause some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sacerdotal character but it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal that the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the superstitious credulity of mankind the sophists of eunapius perform as many miracles as the saints of the desert and the only circumstance in their favor is that they are of a less gloomy complexion instead of devils with horns and tails iamblichus evoked the genii of love eros and anteros from two adjacent fountains two beautiful boys issued from the water fondly embraced him as their father and retired at his command p        and that the grecian mysteries should have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern platonists they arrogantly pretended to control the order of nature to explore the secrets of futurity to command the service of the inferior demons to enjoy the view and conversation of the superior gods and by disengaging the soul from her material bands to reunite that immortal particle with the infinite and divine spirit  the devout and fearless curiosity of julian initiation and fanaticism of julian tempted the philosophers with the hopes of an easy conquest which from the situation of their young proselyte might be productive of the most important consequences the dexterous management of these sophists who played their credulous pupil into each others hands is fairly told by eunapius p        with unsuspecting simplicity the abbe de la bleterie understands and neatly describes the whole comedy vie de julien p         julian imbibed the first rudiments of the platonic doctrines from the mouth of aedesius who had fixed at pergamus his wandering and persecuted school but as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal to the ardour the diligence the rapid conception of his pupil two of his most learned disciples chrysanthes and eusebius supplied at his own desire the place of their aged master these philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their respective parts and they artfully contrived by dark hints and affected disputes to excite the impatient hopes of the aspirant till they delivered him into the hands of their associate maximus the boldest and most skilful master of the theurgic science by his hands julian was secretly initiated at ephesus in the twentieth year of his age his residence at athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition he obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of eleusis which amidst the general decay of the grecian worship still retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity and such was the zeal of julian that he afterward invited the eleusinian pontiff to the court of gaul for the sole purpose of consummating by mystic rites and sacrifices the great work of his sanctification as these ceremonies were performed in the depth of caverns and in the silence of the night and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion of the initiated i shall not presume to describe the horrid sounds and fiery apparitions which were presented to the senses or the imagination of the credulous aspirant when julian in a momentary panic made the sign of the cross the demons instantly disappeared greg naz orat iii p    gregory supposes that they were frightened but the priests declared that they were indignant the reader according to the measure of his faith will determine this profound question  till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light a dark and distant view of the terrors and joys of initiation is shown by dion chrysostom themistius proclus and stobaeus the learned author of the divine legation has exhibited their words vol i p               0 edit      which he dexterously or forcibly applies to his own hypothesis  in the caverns of ephesus and eleusis the mind of julian was penetrated with sincere deep and unalterable enthusiasm though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy which may be observed or at least suspected in the characters of the most conscientious fanatics from that moment he consecrated his life to the service of the gods and while the occupations of war of government and of study seemed to claim the whole measure of his time a stated portion of the hours of the night was invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion the temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of religious abstinence and it was in honor of pan or mercury of hecate or isis that julian on particular days denied himself the use of some particular food which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities by these voluntary fasts he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honored by the celestial powers notwithstanding the modest silence of julian himself we may learn from his faithful friend the orator libanius that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses that they descended upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their favorite hero that they gently interrupted his slumbers by touching his hand or his hair that they warned him of every impending danger and conducted him by their infallible wisdom in every action of his life and that he had acquired such an intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests as readily to distinguish the voice of jupiter from that of minerva and the form of apollo from the figure of hercules julians modesty confined him to obscure and occasional hints but libanius expatiates with pleasure on the fasts and visions of the religious hero legate ad julian p     and orat parental c lxxxiii p  0    0  these sleeping or waking visions the ordinary effects of abstinence and fanaticism would almost degrade the emperor to the level of an egyptian monk but the useless lives of antony or pachomius were consumed in these vain occupations julian could break from the dream of superstition to arm himself for battle and after vanquishing in the field the enemies of rome he calmly retired into his tent to dictate the wise and salutary laws of an empire or to indulge his genius in the elegant pursuits of literature and philosophy  the important secret of the apostasy of julian his religious dissimulation was entrusted to the fidelity of the initiated with whom he was united by the sacred ties of friendship and religion libanius orat parent c x p         gallus had some reason to suspect the secret apostasy of his brother and in a letter which may be received as genuine he exhorts julian to adhere to the religion of their ancestors an argument which as it should seem was not yet perfectly ripe see julian op p     and hist de jovien tom ii p      the pleasing rumor was cautiously circulated among the adherents of the ancient worship and his future greatness became the object of the hopes the prayers and the predictions of the pagans in every province of the empire from the zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte they fondly expected the cure of every evil and the restoration of every blessing and instead of disapproving of the ardour of their pious wishes julian ingenuously confessed that he was ambitious to attain a situation in which he might be useful to his country and to his religion but this religion was viewed with an hostile eye by the successor of constantine whose capricious passions alternately saved and threatened the life of julian the arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited under a despotic government which condescended to fear them and if the pagans were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their superstition the rank of julian would have excepted him from the general toleration the apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the monarchy and his death could alone have appeased the just apprehensions of the christians gregory iii p  0 with inhuman zeal censures constantius for sparing the infant apostate  his french translator p     cautiously observes that such expressions must not be prises a la lettre  but the young prince who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr consulted his safety by dissembling his religion and the easy temper of polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised libanius has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject not of censure but of praise as the statues of the gods says that orator which have been defiled with filth are again placed in a magnificent temple so the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of julian after it had been purified from the errors and follies of his education his sentiments were changed but as it would have been dangerous to have avowed his sentiments his conduct still continued the same very different from the ass in aesop who disguised himself with a lions hide our lion was obliged to conceal himself under the skin of an ass and while he embraced the dictates of reason to obey the laws of prudence and necessity libanius orat parental c ix p      the dissimulation of julian lasted above ten years from his secret initiation at ephesus to the beginning of the civil war when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of christ and of constantius this state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his devotion and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting on solemn festivals at the assemblies of the christians julian returned with the impatience of a lover to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of jupiter and mercury but as every act of dissimulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit the profession of christianity increased the aversion of julian for a religion which oppressed the freedom of his mind and compelled him to hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest attributes of human nature sincerity and courage  the inclination of julian might prefer the gods of homer and of the scipios to the new faith which his uncle had established in the he writes against christianity roman empire and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of baptism but as a philosopher it was incumbent on him to justify his dissent from christianity which was supported by the number of its converts by the chain of prophecy the splendor of miracles and the weight of evidence the elaborate work fabricius biblioth graec l v c viii p    0 and lardner heathen testimonies vol iv p      have accurately compiled all that can now be discovered of julians work against the christians  which he composed amidst the preparations of the persian war contained the substance of those arguments which he had long revolved in his mind some fragments have been transcribed and preserved by his adversary the vehement cyril of alexandria about seventy years after the death of julian he executed a task which had been feebly attempted by philip of side a prolix and contemptible writer even the work of cyril has not entirely satisfied the most favorable judges and the abbe de la bleterie preface a lhist de jovien p  0    wishes that some theologien philosophe a strange centaur would undertake the refutation of julian  and they exhibit a very singular mixture of wit and learning of sophistry and fanaticism the elegance of the style and the rank of the author

edit morel to the writings of porphyry his judgment may be arraigned socrates l iii c    but libanius cannot be accused of flattery to a dead prince  and in the impious list of the enemies of christianity the celebrated name of porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or reputation of julian the minds of the faithful were either seduced or scandalized or alarmed and the pagans who sometimes presumed to engage in the unequal dispute derived from the popular work of their imperial missionary an inexhaustible supply of fallacious objections but in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies the emperor of the romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a polemic divine he contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and propagate his religious opinions and whilst he secretly applauded the strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controversy he was tempted to distrust the sincerity or to despise the understandings of his antagonists who could obstinately resist the force of reason and eloquence  the christians who beheld with horror and universal toleration indignation the apostasy of julian had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments the pagans who were conscious of his fervent zeal expected perhaps with impatience that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods and that the ingenious malice of julian would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors but the hopes as well as the fears of the religious factions were apparently disappointed by the prudent humanity of a prince libanius orat parent c lviii p         has eloquently explained the tolerating principles and conduct of his imperial friend in a very remarkable epistle to the people of bostra julian himself epist lii professes his moderation and betrays his zeal which is acknowledged by ammianus and exposed by gregory orat iii p     who was careful of his own fame of the public peace and of the rights of mankind instructed by history and reflection julian was persuaded that if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence neither steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind the reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the hand religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression and as soon as the persecution subsides those who have yielded are restored as penitents and those who have resisted are honored as saints and martyrs if julian adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of diocletian and his colleagues he was sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of tyrant and add new glories to the catholic church which had derived strength and increase from the severity of the pagan magistrates actuated by these motives and apprehensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign julian surprised the world by an edict which was not unworthy of a statesman or a philosopher he extended to all the inhabitants of the roman world the benefits of a free and equal toleration and the only hardship which he inflicted on the christians was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their fellow subjects whom they stigmatized with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics the pagans received a gracious permission or rather an express order to open all their temples in greece the temples of minerva were opened by his express command before the death of constantius liban orat parent c    p   0 and julian declares himself a pagan in his public manifesto to the athenians this unquestionable evidence may correct the hasty assertion of ammianus who seems to suppose constantinople to be the place where he discovered his attachment to the gods  and they were at once delivered from the oppressive laws and arbitrary vexations which they had sustained under the reign of constantine and of his sons at the same time the bishops and clergy who had been banished by the arian monarch were recalled from exile and restored to their respective churches the donatists the novatians the macedonians the eunomians and those who with a more prosperous fortune adhered to the doctrine of the council of nice julian who understood and derided their theological disputes invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile sects that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious encounters the clamor of controversy sometimes provoked the emperor to exclaim hear me the franks have heard me and the alemanni but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more obstinate and implacable enemies and though he exerted the powers of oratory to persuade them to live in concord or at least in peace he was perfectly satisfied before he dismissed them from his presence that he had nothing to dread from the union of the christians the impartial ammianus has ascribed this affected clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church and the insidious design of undermining the foundations of christianity was inseparably connected with the zeal which julian professed to restore the ancient religion of the empire ammianus xxii   sozomen l v c   bestia moritur tranquillitas

their safety to an apostate l ii c    p       edit dupin   as soon as he ascended the throne he assumed zeal and devotion of julian in the restoration of paganism according to the custom of his predecessors the character of supreme pontiff not only as the most honorable title of imperial greatness but as a sacred and important office the duties of which he was resolved to execute with pious diligence as the business of the state prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects he dedicated a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the sun his gardens were filled with statues and altars of the gods and each apartment of the palace displayed the appearance of a magnificent temple every morning he saluted the parent of light with a sacrifice the blood of another victim was shed at the moment when the sun sunk below the horizon and the moon the stars and the genii of the night received their respective and seasonable honors from the indefatigable devotion of julian on solemn festivals he regularly visited the temple of the god or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly consecrated and endeavored to excite the religion of the magistrates and people by the example of his own zeal instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch distinguished by the splendour of his purple and encompassed by the golden shields of his guards julian solicited with respectful eagerness the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the gods amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests of inferior ministers and of female dancers who were dedicated to the service of the temple it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood to blow the fire to handle the knife to slaughter the victim and thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal to draw forth the heart or liver and to read with the consummate skill of an haruspex the imaginary signs of future events the wisest of the pagans censured this extravagant superstition which affected to despise the restraints of prudence and decency under the reign of a prince who practiced the rigid maxims of economy the expense of religious worship consumed a very large portion of the revenue a constant supply of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates to bleed on the altars of the gods an hundred oxen were frequently sacrificed by julian on one and the same day and it soon became a popular jest that if he should return with conquest from the persian war the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished yet this expense may appear inconsiderable when it is compared with the splendid presents which were offered either by the hand or by order of the emperor to all the celebrated places of devotion in the roman world and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples which had suffered the silent decay of time or the recent injuries of christian rapine encouraged by the example the exhortations the liberality of their pious sovereign the cities and families resumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies every part of the world exclaims libanius with devout transport displayed the triumph of religion and the grateful prospect of flaming altars bleeding victims the smoke of incense and a solemn train of priests and prophets without fear and without danger the sound of prayer and of music was heard on the tops of the highest mountains and the same ox afforded a sacrifice for the gods and a supper for their joyous votaries the restoration of the pagan worship is described by julian misopogon p     libanius orat parent c  0 p         and orat consular ad julian p         edit morel ammianus xxii    and gregory nazianzen orat iv p     these writers agree in the essential and even minute facts but the different lights in which they view the extreme devotion of julian are expressive of the gradations of selfapplause passionate admiration mild reproof and partial invective   but the genius and power of julian were unequal reformation of paganism to the enterprise of restoring a religion which was destitute of theological principles of moral precepts and of ecclesiastical discipline which rapidly hastened to decay and dissolution and was not susceptible of any solid or consistent reformation the jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff more especially after that office had been united with the imperial dignity comprehended the whole extent of the roman empire julian named for his vicars in the several provinces the priests and philosophers whom he esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great design and his pastoral letters see julian epistol xlix lxii lxiii and a long and curious fragment without beginning or end p       0  the supreme pontiff derides the mosaic history and the christian discipline prefers the greek poets to the hebrew prophets and palliates with the skill of a jesuit the relative worship of images  if we may use that name still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions he directs that in every city the sacerdotal order should be composed without any distinction of birth or fortune of those persons who were the most conspicuous for their love of the gods and of men if they are guilty continues he of any scandalous offense they should be censured or degraded by the superior pontiff but as long as they retain their rank they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and people their humility may be shown in the plainness of their domestic garb their dignity in the pomp of holy vestments when they are summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar they ought not during the appointed number of days to depart from the precincts of the temple nor should a single day be suffered to elapse without the prayers and the sacrifice which they are obliged to offer for the prosperity of the state and of individuals the exercise of their sacred functions requires an immaculate purity both of mind and body and even when they are dismissed from the temple to the occupations of common life it is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the rest of their fellowcitizens the priest of the gods should never be seen in theaters or taverns his conversation should be chaste his diet temperate his friends of honorable reputation and if he sometimes visits the forum or the palace he should appear only as the advocate of those who have vainly solicited either justice or mercy his studies should be suited to the sanctity of his profession licentious tales or comedies or satires must be banished from his library which ought solely to consist of historical and philosophical writings of history which is founded in truth and of philosophy which is connected with religion the impious opinions of the epicureans and skeptics deserve his abhorrence and contempt the exultation of julian p  0  that these impious sects and even their writings are extinguished may be consistent enough with the sacerdotal character but it is unworthy of a philosopher to wish that any opinions and arguments the most repugnant to his own should be concealed from the knowledge of mankind  but he should diligently study the systems of pythagoras of plato and of the stoics which unanimously teach that there are gods that the world is governed by their providence that their goodness is the source of every temporal blessing and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state of reward or punishment the imperial pontiff inculcates in the most persuasive language the duties of benevolence and hospitality exhorts his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those virtues promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction of country or of religion julian beheld with envy the wise and humane regulations of the church and he very frankly confesses his intention to deprive the christians of the applause as well as advantage which they had acquired by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence yet he insinuates that the christians under the pretense of charity inveigled children from their religion and parents conveyed them on shipboard and devoted those victims to a life of poverty or servitude in a remote country p  0  had the charge been proved it was his duty not to complain but to punish  the same spirit of imitation might dispose the emperor to adopt several ecclesiastical institutions the use and importance of which were approved by the success of his enemies but if these imaginary plans of reformation had been realized the forced and imperfect copy would have been less beneficial to paganism than honorable to christianity gregory nazianzen is facetious ingenious and argumentative orat iii p  0   0  etc he ridicules the folly of such vain imitation and amuses himself with inquiring what lessons moral or theological could be extracted from the grecian fables  the gentiles who peaceably followed the customs of their ancestors were rather surprised than pleased with the introduction of foreign manners and in the short period of his reign julian had frequent occasions to complain of the want of fervor of his own party he accuses one of his pontiffs of a secret confederacy with the christian bishops and presbyters epist lxii  and again  etc epist lxiii   the enthusiasm of julian prompted him to the philosophers embrace the friends of jupiter as his personal friends and brethren and though he partially overlooked the merit of christian constancy he admired and rewarded the noble perseverance of those gentiles who had preferred the favor of the gods to that of the emperor he praises the fidelity of callixene priestess of ceres who had been twice as constant as penelope and rewards her with the priesthood of the

of rhetoricians and of philosophers hastened to the imperial court to occupy the vacant places of the bishops who had seduced the credulity of constantius his successor esteemed the ties of common initiation as far more sacred than those of consanguinity he chose his favorites among the sages who were deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divination and every impostor who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity was assured of enjoying the present hour in honor and affluence the curiosity and credulity of the emperor who tried every mode of divination are fairly exposed by ammianus xxii     among the philosophers maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship of his royal disciple who communicated with unreserved confidence his actions his sentiments and his religious designs during the anxious suspense of the civil war julian epist xxxviii three other epistles xv xvi xxxix in the same style of friendship and confidence are addressed to the philosopher maximus  as soon as julian had taken possession of the palace of constantinople he dispatched an honorable and pressing invitation to maximus who then resided at sardes in lydia with chrysanthius the associate of his art and studies the prudent and superstitious chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey which showed itself according to the rules of divination with the most threatening and malignant aspect but his companion whose fanaticism was of a bolder cast persisted in his interrogations till he had extorted from the gods a seeming consent to his own wishes and those of the emperor the journey of maximus through the cities of asia displayed the triumph of philosophic vanity and the magistrates vied with each other in the honorable reception which they prepared for the friend of their sovereign julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate when he was informed of the arrival of maximus the emperor immediately interrupted his discourse advanced to meet him and after a tender embrace conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly where he publicly acknowledged the benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the philosopher maximus eunapius in

temptations of a court his dress became more splendid his demeanor more lofty and he was exposed under a succeeding reign to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the disciple of plato had accumulated in the short duration of his favor a very scandalous proportion of wealth of the other philosophers and sophists who were invited to the imperial residence by the choice of julian or by the success of maximus few were able to preserve their innocence or their reputation chrysanthius who had refused to quit lydia was created high priest of the province his cautious and temperate use of power secured him after the revolution and he lived in peace while maximus priscus etc were persecuted by the christian ministers see the adventures of those fanatic sophists collected by brucker tom ii p           the liberal gifts of money lands and houses were insufficient to satiate their rapacious avarice and the indignation of the people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject poverty and disinterested professions the penetration of julian could not always be deceived but he was unwilling to despise the characters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem he desired to escape the double reproach of imprudence and inconstancy and he was apprehensive of degrading in the eyes of the profane the honor of letters and of religion see libanius orat parent c  0

engine of absolute power julian applied himself with peculiar diligence to corrupt the religion of his troops without whose hearty concurrence every measure must be dangerous and unsuccessful and the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as easy as it was important the legions of gaul devoted themselves to the faith as well as to the fortunes of their victorious leader and even before the

produced similar effects  the armies of the east which had been trained under the standard of the cross and of constantius required a more artful and expensive mode of persuasion on the days of solemn

was erazed from the labarum and the symbols of war of majesty and of pagan superstition were so dexterously blended that the faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry when he respectfully saluted the person or image of his sovereign the soldiers passed successively in review and each of them before he received from the hand of julian a liberal donative proportioned to his rank and services was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame which burnt upon the altar some christian confessors might resist and others might repent but the far greater number allured by the prospect of gold and awed by the presence of the emperor contracted the criminal engagement and their future perseverance in the worship of the gods was enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest by the frequent repetition of these arts and at the expense of sums which would have purchased the service of half the nations of scythia julian gradually acquired for his troops the

motives of temporal advantage had acquiesced in the religion of the former reign and who afterward returned with the same flexibility of conscience to the faith which was professed by the successors of julian  while the devout monarch incessantly labored the jews to restore and propagate the religion of his ancestors he embraced the extraordinary design of rebuilding the temple of jerusalem in a

event of the persian war he resolved to erect without delay on the commanding eminence of moriah a stately temple which might eclipse the splendour of the church of the resurrection on the adjacent hill of calvary to establish an order of priests whose interested zeal would detect the arts and resist the ambition of their christian rivals and to invite a numerous colony of jews whose stern

incompatible the first place was assigned by julian himself to the virtuous and learned alypius julian epist xxix xxx la bleterie has neglected to translate the second of these epistles  the humanity of alypius was tempered by severe justice and manly fortitude and while he exercised his abilities in the civil administration of britain he imitated in his poetical compositions the harmony and softness of the odes of sappho this minister to whom julian communicated without reserve his most careless levities and his most serious counsels received an extraordinary commission to restore in its pristine beauty the temple of jerusalem and the diligence of alypius required and obtained the strenuous support of the governor of palestine at the call of their great deliverer the jews from all the

famous miracle jewish and heathen testimonies vol iv p        the silence of jerome would lead to a suspicion that the same story which was celebrated at a distance might be despised on the spot   the restoration of the jewish temple was secretly partiality of julian connected with the ruin of the christian church julian still continued to maintain the freedom of religious worship without distinguishing whether this universal toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency he affected to pity the unhappy christians who were mistaken in the most important object of their lives but his pity was degraded by contempt his contempt was embittered by hatred and the sentiments of julian were expressed in a style of sarcastic wit which inflicts a deep and deadly wound whenever it issues from the mouth of a sovereign as he was sensible that the christians gloried in the name of their redeemer he countenanced and perhaps enjoined the use of the less honorable appellation of galilaeans greg naz orat iii p    and this law was confirmed by the invariable practice of julian himself warburton has justly observed p    that the platonists believed in the mysterious virtue of words and julians dislike for the name of christ might proceed from superstition as well as from contempt  he declared that by the folly of the galilaeans whom he describes as a sect of fanatics contemptible to men and odious to the gods the empire had been reduced to the brink of destruction and he insinuates in a public edict that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by salutary violence fragment julian p     he derides the  epist vii and so far loses sight of the principles of toleration as to wish epist xlii   an ungenerous distinction was admitted into the mind and counsels of julian that according to the difference of their religious sentiments one part of his subjects deserved his favor and friendship while the other was entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not refuse to an obedient people   these two lines which julian has changed and perverted in the true spirit of a bigot epist xlix are taken from the speech of aeolus when he refuses to grant ulysses a fresh supply of winds odyss x    libanius orat parent c lix p     attempts to justify this partial behavior by an apology in which persecution peeps through the mask of candor    according to a principle pregnant with mischief and oppression the emperor transferred to the pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal allowanoes from the public revenue which had been granted to the church by the piety of constantine and his sons the proud system of clerical honors and immunities which had been constructed with so much art and labor was levelled to the ground the hopes of testamentary donations were intercepted by the rigor of the laws and the priests of the christian sect were confounded with the last and most ignominious class of the people such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics were soon afterward imitated by the wisdom of an orthodox prince the peculiar distinctions which policy has bestowed or superstition has lavished on the sacerdotal order must be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the state but the will of the legislator was not exempt from prejudice and passion and it was the object of the insidious policy of julian to deprive the christians of all the temporal honors and advantages which rendered them respectable in the eyes of the world these laws which assected the clergy may be found in the slight hints of julian himself epist lii in the vague declamations of gregory orat iii p       and in the positive assertions of sozomen

inclemens perenni obruendum silentio ammian xxii  0 xxv    the motives alleged by the emperor to justify this partial and oppressive measure might command during his lifetime the silence of slaves and the applause of flatterers julian abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word which might be indifferently applied to the language and the religion of the greeks he contemptuously observes that the men who exalt the merit of implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the advantages of science and he vainly contends that if they refuse to adore the gods of homer and demosthenes they ought to content themselves with expounding luke and matthew in the churches of the galilaeans the edict itself which is still extant among the epistles of julian xlii may be compared with the loose invectives of gregory orat iii p    tillemont mem eccles tom vii p            has collected the seeming differences of ancients and moderns they may be easily reconciled the christians were directly forbid to teach they were indirectly forbid to learn since they would not frequent the schools of the pagans  in all the cities of the roman world the education of the youth was entrusted to masters of grammar and rhetoric who were elected by the magistrates maintained at the public expense and distinguished by many lucrative and honorable privileges the edict of julian appears to have included the physicians and professors of all the liberal arts and the emperor who reserved to himself the approbation of the candidates was authorized by the laws to corrupt or to punish the religious constancy of the most

impressions of literature and idolatry if the greatest part of the christian youth should be deterred by their own scruples or by those of their parents from accepting this dangerous mode of instruction they must at the same time relinquish the benefits of a liberal education julian had reason to expect that in the space of a few years the church would relapse into its primaeval simplicity and that the theologians who possessed an adequate share of the learning and eloquence of the age would be succeeded by a generation of blind and ignorant fanatics incapable of defending the truth of their own principles or of exposing the various follies of polytheism they had recourse to the expedient of composing books for their own schools within a few months apollinaris produced his christian imitations of homer a sacred history in xxiv books pindar euripides and menander and sozomen is satisfied that they equalled or excelled the originals   it was undoubtedly the wish and the design of disgrace and oppression of the christians julian to deprive the christians of the advantages of wealth of knowledge and of power but the injustice of excluding them from all offices of trust and profit seems to have been the result of his general policy rather than the immediate consequence of any positive law it was the instruction of julian to his magistrates epist vii  sozomen l

who studiously guarded the camp and the tribunals with the ensigns of idolatry the powers of government were entrusted to the pagans who professed an ardent zeal for the religion of their ancestors

provincial ministers of his authority were placed in a less conspicuous station in the exercise of arbitrary power they consulted the wishes rather than the commands of their sovereign and ventured to exercise a secret and vexatious tyranny against the sectaries on whom they were not permitted to confer the honors of martyrdom the emperor who dissembled as long as possible his knowledge of the

pagan temples with which they were armed was the law that obliged the christians to make full and ample satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under the preceding reign the zeal of the triumphant church had not always expected the sanction of the public authority and the bishops who were secure of impunity had often marched at the head of their congregations to attack and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness the consecrated lands which had increased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the clergy were clearly defined and easily restored but on these lands and on the ruins of pagan superstition the christians had frequently erected their own religious edifices and as it was necessary to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt the justice and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party while the other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence if we compare the gentle language of libanius orat parent c  0 p     with the passionate

authors of the injury had neither the ability nor the inclination to discharge this accumulated demand and the impartial wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed in balancing the adverse claims and complaints by an equitable and temperate arbitration but the whole empire and particularly the east was thrown into confusion by the rash edicts of julian and the pagan magistrates inflamed

ambitious of lying at the feet of their bishop and the priests of apollo retired with their affrighted and indignant votaries as soon as another revolution seemed to restore the fortune of paganism the church of st babylas was demolished and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of syrian kings but the first and most serious care of julian was to deliver his oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living christians who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud or enthusiasm ecclesiastical critics particularly those who love relics exult in the confession of julian misopogon p     and libanius naenia p     that apollo was disturbed by the vicinity of one dead man yet ammianus xxii    clears and purifies the whole

the modest behavior which might have assuaged the jealousy of an hostile government was neglected on this occasion by the zeal of the christians the lofty car that transported the relics of babylas was followed and accompanied and received by an innumerable multitude who chanted with thundering acclamations the psalms of david the most expressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters the return of the saint was a triumph and the triumph was an insult on the religion of the emperor who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment during the night which terminated this indiscreet procession the temple of daphne was in flames the statue of apollo was consumed and the walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin the christians of antioch asserted with religious confidence that the powerful intercession of st babylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven against the devoted roof but as julian was reduced to the alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle he chose without hesitation without evidence but with some color of probability to impute the fire of daphne to the revenge of the galilaeans julian in misopogon p     rather insinuates than affirms their guilt ammianus xxii    treats the imputation as levissimus rumor and relates the story with extraordinary candor  their offense had it been sufficiently proved might have justified the retaliation which was immediately executed by the order of julian of shutting the doors and confiscating julian shuts the cathedral of antioch the wealth of the cathedral of antioch to discover the criminals who were guilty of the tumult of the fire or of secreting the riches of the church several ecclesiastics were tortured quo tam atroci casu repent consumpto ad id usque imperatoris ira

circumstances of indignity and profanation and the seasonable death of the principal actor julians uncle is related with much superstitious complacency by the abbe de la bleterie vie de julien p           and a presbyter of the name of theodoret was beheaded by the sentence of the count of the east but this hasty act was blamed by the emperor who lamented with real or affected concern that the imprudent zeal of his ministers would tarnish his reign with the disgrace of persecution besides the ecclesiastical historians who are more or less to be suspected we may allege the passion of st theodore in the acta sincera of ruinart p     the complaint of julian gives it an original and authentic air   the zeal of the ministers of julian was instantly checked by the frown of their sovereign but when the father of his country declares himself the leader of a faction the license of popular fury cannot easily be restrained nor consistently punished julian in a public composition applauds the devotion and loyalty of the holy cities of syria whose pious inhabitants had destroyed at the first signal the sepulchers of the galilaeans and faintly complains that they had revenged the injuries of the gods with less moderation than he should have recommended julian misopogon p      this imperfect and reluctant confession may appear to confirm the ecclesiastical narratives that in the cities of gaza ascalon caesarea heliopolis etc the pagans abused without prudence or remorse the moment of their prosperity that the unhappy objects of their cruelty were released from torture only by death that as their mangled bodies were dragged through the streets they were pierced such was the universal rage by the spits of cooks and the distaffs of enraged women and that the entrails of christian priests and virgins after they had been tasted by those bloody fanatics were mixed with barley and contemptuously thrown to the unclean animals of the city see gregory nazianzen orat iii

arts of fraud and corruption but his malversations were so notorious that george was compelled to escape from the pursuits of justice after this disgrace in which he appears to have saved his fortune at the expense of his honor he embraced with real or affected zeal the profession of arianism from the love or the ostentation of learning he collected a valuable library of history rhetoric philosophy and theology after the massacre of george the emperor julian repeatedly sent orders to preserve the library for his own use and to torture the slaves who might be suspected of secreting any books he praises the merit of the collection from whence he had borrowed and transcribed several manuscripts while he pursued his studies in cappadocia he could wish indeed that the works of the galilaeans might perish but he requires an exact account even of those theological volumes lest other treatises more valuable should be confounded in their loss julian epist ix xxxvi  and the choice of the prevailing faction promoted george of cappadocia to the throne of athanasius the entrance of the new archbishop was that of a barbarian conqueror and each moment of his reign was polluted by

great people condescended to practice the vile and pernicious arts of an informer the alexandrians could never forget nor forgive the tax which he suggested on all the houses of the city under an obsolete claim that the royal founder had conveyed to his successors the ptolemies and the caesars the perpetual property of the soil the pagans who had been flattered with the hopes of freedom and toleration excited his devout avarice and the rich temples of alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prelate who exclaimed in a loud and threatening tone how long will these sepulchers be permitted to stand under the reign of constantius he was expelled by the fury or rather by the justice of the people and it was not without a violent struggle that the civil and military

insulted the weakness of the valentinians and committed such disorders as ought not to be suffered with impunity in a wellregulated state without expecting the slow forms of justice the exasperated prince directed his mandate to the magistrates of edessa julian epist xliii  by which he confiscated the whole property of the church the money was distributed among the soldiers the lands were added to the domain and this act of oppression was aggravated by the most ungenerous irony i show myself says julian the true friend of the galilaeans their admirable law has promised the kingdom of heaven

in a more serious tone take care how you provoke my patience and humanity if these disorders continue i will revenge on the magistrates the crimes of the people and you will have reason to dread not only confiscation and exile but fire and the sword the tumults of alexandria were doubtless of a more bloody and dangerous nature but a christian bishop had fallen by the hands of the pagans and the public epistle of julian affords a very lively proof of the partial spirit of his administration his reproaches to the citizens of alexandria are mingled with expressions of esteem and tenderness and he laments that on this occasion they should have departed from the gentle and generous manners which attested their grecian extraction he gravely censures the offense which they had committed against the laws of justice and humanity but he recapitulates with visible complacency the intolerable provocations which they had so long endured from the impious tyranny of george of cappadocia julian admits the principle that a wise and vigorous government should chastise the insolence of the people yet in consideration of their founder alexander and of serapis their tutelar deity he grants a free and gracious pardon to the guilty city for which he again feels the affection of a brother julian epist x he allowed his friends to assuage his anger ammian xxii      after the tumult of alexandria

ecclesiastical dictator see athanas ad rufin tom ii p  0    and greg nazlanzen orat iii p         who justly states the temperate zeal of the primate as much more meritorious than his prayers his fasts his persecutions etc  three years were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops of the west had ignorantly or reluctantly subscribed the confession of rimini they repented they believed but they dreaded the unseasonable rigor of their orthodox brethren and if their pride was stronger than their faith they might throw themselves into the arms of the arians to escape the indignity of a public penance which must degrade them to the condition of obscure laymen at the same time the domestic differences concerning the union and distinction of the divine persons were agitated with some heat among the catholic doctors and the progress of this metaphysical controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting division of the greek and latin churches by the wisdom of a select synod to which the name and presence of athanasius gave the authority of a general council the bishops who had unwarily deviated into error were admitted to the communion of the church on the easy condition of subscribing the nicene creed without any formal acknowledgment of their past fault or any minute definition of their scholastic opinions the advice of the primate of egypt had already prepared the clergy of gaul and spain of italy and greece for the reception of this salutary measure and notwithstanding the opposition of some ardent spirits i have not leisure to follow the blind obstinacy of

affords many important dates which are authenticated by the computation of egyptian months  julian who despised the christians honored athanasius with his sincere and peculiar hatred for his sake alone he introduced an arbitrary distinction repugnant at least to the spirit of his former declarations he maintained that the galilaeans whom he had recalled from exile were not restored by that general indulgence to the possession of their respective churches and he expressed his astonishment that a criminal who had been repeatedly condemned by the judgment of the emperors should dare to insult the majesty of the laws and insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of alexandria without expecting the orders of his sovereign as a punishment for the imaginary offense he again banished athanasius from the city and he was pleased to suppose that this act of justice would be highly agreeable to his pious subjects the pressing solicitations of the people soon convinced him that the majority of the alexandrians were christians and that the greatest part of the christians were firmly attached to the cause of their oppressed primate but the knowledge of their sentiments instead of persuading him to recall his decree provoked him to extend to all egypt the term of the exile of athanasius the zeal of the multitude rendered julian still more inexorable he was alarmed by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city a daring and popular leader and the language of his resentment discovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and abilities of athanasius the execution of the sentence was still delayed by the caution or negligence of ecdicius prefect of egypt who was at length awakened from his lethargy by a severe reprimand though you neglect says julian to write to me on any other subject at least it is your duty to inform me of your conduct toward athanasius the enemy of the gods my intentions have been long since communicated to you i swear by the great serapis that unless on the calends of december athanasius has departed from alexandria nay from egypt the officers of your government shall pay a fine of one hundred pounds of gold you know my

create guilt  the death of athanasius was not expressly commanded but the prefect of egypt understood that it was safer for him to exceed than to neglect the orders of an irritated master the archbishop prudently retired to the monasteries of the desert eluded with his usual dexterity the snares of the enemy and lived to triumph over the ashes of a prince who in words of formidable import had declared his wish that the whole venom of the galilaean school were contained in the single person of athanasius the three epistles of julian which explain his intentions and conduct with regard

be confessed that the real sufferings of the christians were inflamed and magnified by human passions and religious enthusiasm the meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the gospel was the object of the applause rather than of the imitation of their successors the christians who had now possessed above forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government

with sullen resolution that their submission was no longer the effect of weakness and that in the imperfect state of human virtue the patience which is founded on principle may be exhausted by persecution it is impossible to determine how far the zeal of julian would have prevailed over his good sense and humanity but if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church we shall be convinced that before the emperor could have extinguished the religion of christ he must have involved his country in the horrors of a civil war the resignation of gregory is truly edifying orat iv

discussed the etymology origin resemblance and disagreement of the greek satyrs a dramatic piece which was acted after the tragedy and the latin satires from satura a miscellaneous composition either in prose or verse eut the caesars of julian are of such an original cast that the critic is perplexed to which class he should ascribe them  during the freedom and equality of the days of the saturnalia romulus prepared a feast for the deities of olympus who had adopted him as a worthy associate and for the roman princes who had reigned over his martial people and the vanquished nations of the earth the immortals were placed in just order on their thrones of state and the table of the caesars was spread below the moon in the upper region of the air the tyrants who would have disgraced the society of gods and men were thrown headlong by the inexorable nemesis into the tartarean abyss the rest of the caesars successively advanced to their seats and as they passed the vices the defects the blemishes of their respective characters were maliciously noticed by old silenus a laughing moralist who disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a bacchanal this mixed character of silenus is finely painted in the sixth eclogue of virgil  as soon as the feast was ended the voice of mercury proclaimed the will of jupiter that a celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit julius caesar augustus trajan and marcus antoninus were selected as the most illustrious candidates the effeminate constantine every impartial reader must perceive and condemn the partiality of julian against his uncle constantine and the christian religion on this occasion the interpreters are compelled by a more sacred interest to renounce their allegiance and to desert the cause of their author was not excluded from this honorable competition and the great alexander was invited to dispute the prize of glory with the roman heroes each of the candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits but in the judgment of the gods the modest silence of marcus pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals when the judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart and to scrutinize the springs of action the superiority of the imperial stoic appeared still more decisive and conspicuous julian was secretly inclined to prefer a greek to a roman but when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher he was sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to socrates than to alexander orat ad themistium p      alexander and caesar augustus trajan and constantine acknowledged with a blush that fame or power or pleasure had been the important object of their labors but the gods themselves beheld with reverence and love a virtuous mortal who had practiced on the throne the lessons of philosophy and who in a state of human imperfection had aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the deity the value of this agreeable composition the caesars of julian is enhanced by the rank of the author a prince who delineates with freedom the vices and virtues of his predecessors subscribes in every line the censure or approbation of his own conduct  in the cool moments of reflection julian preferred he resolves to march against the persians a d     the useful and benevolent virtues of antoninus but his ambitious spirit was inflamed by the glory of alexander and he solicited with equal ardour the esteem of the wise and the applause of the multitude in the season of life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigor the emperor who was instructed by the experience and animated by the success of the german war resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and

barbarians of the danube would be restrained from any future violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of his name and the additional fortifications with which he strengthened the thracian and

so long resisted and insulted the majesty of rome alexander reminds his rival caesar who depreciated the fame and merit of an asiatic victory that crassus and antony had felt the persian arrows and that the romans in a war of three hundred years had not yet subdued the single province of mesopotamia or assyria caesares p      as soon as the persian monarch was informed that the throne of constantius was filled by a prince of a very different character he condescended to make some artful or perhaps sincere overtures toward a negotiation of peace but the pride of sapor was astonished by the firmness of julian who sternly declared that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of mesopotamia and who added with a smile of contempt that it was needless to treat by ambassadors as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court of persia the impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations the generals were named a formidable army was destined for this important service and julian marching from constantinople through the provinces of asia minor arrived at antioch about eight months after the death of his predecessor his ardent desire to march into the heart of persia was checked by the indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire by his zeal to revive the worship of the gods and by the advice of his wisest friends who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of winter quarters to restore the exhausted strength of the legions of gaul and the discipline and spirit of the eastern troops julian was persuaded to fix till the ensuing spring his residence julian proceeds from constantinople to antioch august at antioch among a people

of antioch the miniature which the abbe de la bleterie has copied from thence vie de julien p     is elegant and correct  the warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence and the lively licentiousness of the greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the syrians fashion was the only law pleasure the only pursuit and the splendor of dress and furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of antioch the arts of luxury were honored the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal corruption of the capital of the east the love of spectacles was the taste or rather passion of the syrians the most skilful artists were

circus was considered as the happiness and as the glory of antioch the rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory and was insensible of such happiness soon disgusted the delicacy of his subjects and the effeminate orientals could neither imitate nor admire the severe simplicity which julian always maintained and sometimes affected the days of festivity consecrated by ancient custom to the honor of the gods were the only occasions in which julian relaxed his philosophic severity and those festivals were the only days in which the syrians of antioch could reject the allurements of pleasure the majority of the people supported the glory of the christian name which had been first invented by their ancestors  the people of antioch ingeniously professed their attachment to the chi

henceforward i shall quote  were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common adversary  the strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an apostate the enemy and successor their aversion to julian of a prince who had engaged the affections of a very numerous sect and the removal of st babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of julian his subjects complained with superstitious indignation that famine had pursued the emperors steps from constantinople to antioch and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve their distress the inclemency scarcity of corn and public discontent of the season had affected the harvests of syria and the price of bread julian states three different proportions of five ten or fifteen modii of wheat for one piece of gold according to the degrees of plenty and scarcity in misopogon p     from this fact and from some collateral examples i conclude that under the successors of constantine the moderate price of wheat was about thirtytwo shillings the english quarter which is equal to the average price of the sixtyfour first years of the present century see arbuthnots tables

this last i am proud to quote as the work of a sage and a friend  in the markets of antioch had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn but the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly in this unequal contest in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party as his exclusive property is used by another as a lucrative object of trade and is required by a third for the daily and necessary support of life all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenseless consumers the hardships of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine when the luxurious citizens of antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish julian publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine oil and bread but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people with this salutary view the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step of fixing by legal authority the value of corn he enacted that in a time of scarcity it should be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years and that his own example might strengthen his laws he sent into the market four hundred and twentytwo thousand modii or measures which were drawn by his order from the granaries of hierapolis of chalcis and even of egypt the consequences might have been foreseen and were soon felt the imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants the proprietors of land or of corn withheld from the city the accustomed supply and the small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price julian still continued to applaud his own policy treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur and convinced antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy though not the cruelty of his brother gallus nunquam a proposito declinabat galli similis fratris licet incruentus ammian xxii    the ignorance of the most enlightened princes may claim

calamities of their country and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense not of public duty but of private interest the whole body consisting of two hundred of the most noble and wealthy citizens were sent under a guard from the palace to the prison and though they were permitted before the close of evening to return to their respective houses their short and easy

power refused his passions the gratification of revenge a tyrant might have proscribed without distinction the lives and fortunes of the citizens of antioch and the unwarlike syrians must have patiently submitted to the lust the rapaciousness and the cruelty of the faithful legions of gaul a milder sentence might have deprived the capital of the east of its honors and privileges and the

born in the capital of the east he publicly professed the arts of a d        0 etc rhetoric and declamation at nice nicomedia constantinople athens and during the remainder of his life at antioch his school was assiduously frequented by the grecian youth his disciples who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty celebrated their incomparable master and the jealousy of his rivals who persecuted him from one city to another confirmed the favorable opinion which libanius ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit the praeceptors of julian had extorted a rash but solemn assurance that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed he secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist and gradually surpassed in the perfect imitation of his style the most laborious of his domestic pupils libanius orat parent c vii p   0      when julian ascended the throne he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the syrian sophist who had preserved in a degenerate age the grecian purity of taste of manners and of religion the emperors prepossession was increased and justified by the discreet pride of his favorite instead of pressing with the foremost of the crowd into the palace of constantinople libanius calmly expected his arrival at antioch withdrew from court on the first symptoms of coldness and indifference required a formal invitation for each visit and taught his sovereign an important lesson that he might command the obedience of a subject but that he must deserve the attachment of a friend the sophists of every age despising or affecting to despise the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune eunapius reports that libanius refused the honorary rank of praetorian prefect as

libanius still exist for the most part they are the vain and idle compositions of an orator who cultivated the science of words the productions of a recluse student whose mind regardless of his contemporaries was incessantly fixed on the trojan war and the athenian commonwealth yet the sophist of antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation he entertained a various and elaborate correspondence near two thousand of his letters a mode of composition in which libanius was thought to excel are still extant and already published the critics may praise their subtle and elegant brevity yet dr bentley dissertation upon phalaris p     might justly though quaintly observe that you feel by the emptiness and deadness of them that you converse with some dreaming pedant with his

later date  to lose whatever might have rendered it desirable but libanius experienced the peculiar misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences to which he had consecrated his genius the friend of julian was an indignant spectator of the triumph of christianity and his bigotry which darkened the prospect of the visible world did not inspire libanius with any lively hopes of celestial

were invited to the imperial table julian placing himself between them attempted without success to inculcate the lesson and example of toleration supported with affected calmness the indiscreet zeal of the aged christian who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature and the duty of a subject and at length turning toward the afflicted youth since you have lost a father said he for my sake it is

of cypresses about twenty miles from the city of hierapolis the solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants of batnae who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities apollo and jupiter but the serious piety of julian was offended by the tumult of their applause and he too clearly discerned that the smoke which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery rather than of devotion the ancient and magnificent temple which had sanctified for so many ages the city of hierapolis see the curious treatise de dea syria inserted among the works of lucian tom iii p        0 edit reitz the singular appellation of ninus vetus ammian xiv   might induce a suspicion that hierapolis had been the royal seat of the assyrians  no longer subsisted and the consecrated wealth which afforded a liberal maintenance to more than three hundred priests might hasten its downfall yet julian enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend whose religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of constantius and gallus as often as those princes lodged at his house in their passage through hierapolis in the hurry of military preparation and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence the zeal of julian appears to have been lively and uniform he had now undertaken an important and difficult war and the anxiety of the event rendered him still more attentive to observe and register the most trifling presages from which according to the rules of divination any knowledge of futurity could be derived julian epist xxviii kept a regular account of all the fortunate omens but he suppresses the inauspicious signs which ammianus xxiii   has carefully recorded  he informed libanius of his progress as

samosata or in the churches of edessa but as the warlike emperor instead of constantius had chosen alexander for his model he advanced without delay to carrhae haran or carrhae was the ancient residence of the sabaeans and of abraham see the index geographicus of schultens adcalcem vit saladin a work from which i have obtained much oriental knowledge concerning the ancient and modern geography of syria and the adjacent countries  a very ancient city of mesopotamia at the distance of fourscore miles from hierapolis the temple of the moon attracted the devotion of julian but the halt of a few days was principally employed in completing the immense preparations of the persian war the secret of the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast but as carrhae is the point of separation of the two great roads he could no longer conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of sapor on the side of the tigris or on that of the euphrates the emperor detached an army of thirty thousand men under the command of his kinsman procopius and of sebastian who had been duke of egypt they were ordered to direct their march toward nisibis and to secure the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy before they attempted the passage of the tigris their subsequent operations were left to the discretion of the generals but julian expected that after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of media and adiabene they might arrive under the walls of ctesiphon about the same time that he himself advancing with equal steps along the banks of the euphrates should besiege the capital of the persian monarchy the success of this wellconcerted plan depended in disaffection of the king of armenia a great measure on the powerful and ready

third day the banks of the euphrates where the strong town of nicephorium or callinicum had been founded by the macedonian kings from thence the emperor pursued his march above ninety miles along the winding stream of the euphrates till at length about one month after his departure from antioch he discovered the towers of circesium the extreme limit of the roman dominions the army of julian the

of displaying his eloquence he animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors he excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence of the persians and he exhorted them to imitate his firm resolution either to extirpate that perfidious nation or to devote his life in the cause of the republic the eloquence of julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of silver to every soldier and the bridge of the chaboras was instantly cut away to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier perpetually exposed to the inroads of the hostile arabs a detachment of four

principal columns the front and flanks of the army were covered by lucillianus with a flying detachment of fifteen hundred lightarmed soldiers whose active vigilance observed the most distant signs and conveyed the earliest notice of any hostile approach dagalaiphus and secundinus duke of osrhoene conducted the troops of the rearguard the baggage securely proceeded in the intervals of the columns and the ranks from a motive either of use or ostentation were formed in such open order that the whole line of march extended almost ten miles the ordinary post of julian was at the head of the center column but as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a monarch he rapidly moved with a small escort of light cavalry to the front the rear the flanks wherever his presence could animate or protect the march of the roman army the country which they traversed from the chaboras to the cultivated lands of assyria may be considered as a part of the desert of arabia a dry and barren waste which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human industry julian marched over the same ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger cyrus and which is described by one of the companions of his expedition the sage and heroic xenophon see the first book of the anabasis p       this pleasing work is original and authentic yet

soldiers of julian with their tents were suddenly thrown to the ground by the violence of an unexpected hurricane  the sandy plains of mesopotamia were abandoned his success to the antelopes and wild

the march of a roman emperor till they were diverted from such fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of prince hormisdas and the approaching terrors of the fleet and army they implored and experienced the clemency of julian who transplanted the people to an advantageous settlement near chalcis in syria and admitted pusaeus the governor to an honorable rank in his service and friendship but the impregnable fortress of thilutha could scorn the menace of a siege and the emperor was obliged to content himself with an insulting promise that when he had subdued the interior provinces of persia thilutha would no longer refuse to grace the triumph of the conqueror the inhabitants of the open towns unable to resist and unwilling to yield fled with precipitation and their houses filled

superfluous waters from one river into the other at the season of their respective inundations subdividing themselves into smaller and smaller branches they refreshed the dry lands and supplied the

considerable villages were assigned for the subsistence of his indian dogs eight hundred stallions and sixteen thousand mares were constantly kept at the expense of the country for the royal stables and as the daily tribute which was paid to the satrap amounted to one english bushel of silver we may compute the annual revenue of assyria at more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling assyria

treasure the monarch might annually save three millions six hundred thousand pounds of the seventeen or eighteen millions raised upon the people   the fields of assyria were devoted by julian to the calamities of war and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine invasion of assyria a d     may and cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the roman provinces the trembling assyrians summoned the rivers to their assistance and completed with their own hands the ruin of their country the roads were rendered impracticable a flood of waters was poured into the camp and during several days the troops of julian were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships but every obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries who were inured to toil as well as to danger and who felt themselves animated by the spirit of their leader the damage was gradually repaired the waters were restored to their proper channels whole groves of palm trees were cut down and placed along the broken parts of the road and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals on bridges of floating rafts which were supported by the help of bladders two cities of assyria presumed to resist the arms of a roman emperor and they both paid the severe penalty of their rashness at the distance of fifty miles from the royal residence siege of perisabor of ctesiphon perisabor or anbar held the second rank in the province a city large populous and well fortified surrounded with a double wall almost encompassed by a branch of the euphrates and defended by the valor of a numerous garrison the exhortations of hormisdas were repulsed with contempt and the ears of the persian prince were wounded by a just reproach that unmindful of his royal birth he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country the assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful as well as vigorous defense till the lucky stroke of a batteringram having opened a large breach by shattering one of the angles of the wall they hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel the soldiers of julian rushed impetuously into the town and after the full gratification of every military appetite perisabor was reduced to ashes and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses the contest was continued by an incessant and mutual discharge of missile weapons and the superiority which the romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the besieged but as soon as an helepolis had been constructed which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts the tremendous aspect of a moving turret that would leave no hope of resistance or of mercy terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission and the place was surrendered only two days after julian first appeared under the walls of perisabor two thousand five hundred persons of both sexes the feeble remnant of a flourishing people were permitted to retire the plentiful magazines of corn of arms and of splendid furniture were partly distributed among the troops and partly reserved for the public service the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the euphrates and the fate of amida was revenged by the total ruin of perisabor  the city or rather fortress of maogamalcha of maogamalcha which was defended by sixteen large towers a deep ditch and two strong and solid walls of brick and bitumen appears to have been constructed at the distance of eleven miles as the safeguard of the capital of persia the emperor apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear immediately formed the siege of maogamalcha and the roman army was distributed for that purpose into three divisions victor at the head of the cavalry and of a detachment of heavyarmed foot was ordered to clear the country as far as the banks of the tigris and the suburbs of ctesiphon the conduct of the attack was assumed by julian himself who seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls while he secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city under the direction of nevitta and dagalaiphus the trenches were opened at a considerable distance and gradually prolonged as far as the edge of the ditch the ditch was speedily filled with earth and by the incessant labor of the troops a mine was carried under the foundations of the walls and sustained at sufficient intervals by props of timber three chosen cohorts advancing in a single file silently explored the dark and dangerous passage till their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence that he was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city julian checked their ardour that he might ensure their success and immediately diverted the attention of the garrison by the tumult and clamor of a general assault the persians who from their walls contemptuously beheld the progress of an impotent attack celebrated with songs of triumph the glory of sapor and ventured to assure the emperor that he might ascend the starry mansion of ormusd before he could hope to take the impregnable city of maogamalcha the city was already taken history has recorded the name of a private soldier the first who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower the passage was widened by his companions who pressed forwards with impatient valor fifteen hundred enemies were already in the midst of the city the astonished garrison abandoned the walls and their only hope of safety the gates were instantly burst open and the revenge of the soldier unless it were suspended by lust or avarice was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre the governor who had yielded on a promise of mercy was burnt alive a few days afterward on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words against the honor of prince hormisdas the fortifications were razed to the ground and not a vestige was left that the city of maogamalcha had ever existed the neighborhood of the capital of persia was adorned with three stately palaces laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an eastern monarch the pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the tigris was improved according to the persian taste by the symmetry of flowers fountains and shady walks and spacious parks were enclosed for the reception of the bears lions and wild boars which were maintained at a considerable expense for the pleasure of the royal chase the parkwalls were broke down the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers and the palaces of sapor were reduced to ashes by the command of the roman emperor julian on this occasion showed himself ignorant or careless of the laws of civility which the prudence and refinement of polished ages have established between hostile princes yet these wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of pity or resentment a simple naked statue finished by the hand of a grecian artist is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of barbaric labor and if we are more deeply affected by the ruin of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage our humanity must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of human life the operations of the assyrian war are

embraces with the same firmness that he resisted the allurements of love he sustained the hardships of war when the romans marched through the flat and flooded country their sovereign on foot at the head of his legions shared their fatigues and animated their diligence in every useful labor the hand of julian was prompt and strenuous and the imperial purple was wet and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier the two sieges allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalising his personal valor which in the improved state of the military art can seldom be exerted by a prudent general the emperor stood before the citadel of perisabor insensible of his extreme danger and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones that were directed against his person as he examined the exterior fortifications of maogamalcha two persians devoting themselves for their country suddenly rushed upon him with drawn scimitars the emperor dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield and with a steady and wellaimed thrust laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet the esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he approves is the noblest recompense of a deserving subject and the authority which julian derived from his personal merit enabled him to revive and enforce the rigor of ancient discipline he punished with death or ignominy the misbehaviour of three troops of horse who in a skirmish with the surenas had lost their honor and one of their standards and he

indignation was expressed in the grave and manly language of a roman riches are the object of your desires those riches are in the hands of the persians and the spoils of this fruitful country are proposed as the prize of your valor and discipline believe me added julian the roman republic which formerly possessed such immense treasures is now reduced to want and wretchedness since our princes have been persuaded by weak and interested ministers to purchase with gold the tranquillity of the barbarians the revenue is exhausted the cities are ruined the provinces are dispeopled for myself the only inheritance that i have received from my royal ancestors is a soul incapable of fear and as long as i am convinced that every real advantage is seated in the mind i shall not blush to acknowledge an honorable poverty which in the days of ancient virtue was considered as the glory of fabricius that glory and that virtue may be your own if you listen to the voice of heaven and of your leader but

apprehension to the obscurity of a private station i give this speech as original and genuine ammianus might hear could transcribe and was incapable of inventing it i have used some slight freedoms and conclude with the most forcible sentence  the modest resolution of julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful obedience of the romans who declared their confidence of victory while they fought under the banners of their heroic prince their courage was kindled by his frequent and familiar asseverations for such wishes were the oaths of julian so may i reduce the persians under

the only remaining quarter of that greek colony had resumed with the assyrian language and manners the primitive appellation of coche coche was situate on the western side of the tigris but it was naturally considered as a suburb of ctesiphon with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats the united parts contributed to form the common epithet of al modain the cities which the orientals have bestowed on the winter residence of the sassanides and the whole circumference of the persian capital was strongly fortified by the waters of the river by lofty walls and by impracticable morasses near the ruins of seleucia the camp of julian was fixed and secured by a ditch and rampart against the sallies of the numerous and enterprising garrison of coche in this fruitful and pleasant country the romans were plentifully supplied with water and forage and several forts which might have embarrassed the motions of the army submitted after some resistance to the efforts of their valor the fleet passed from the euphrates into an artificial derivation of that river which pours a copious and navigable stream into the tigris at a small distance below the great city if they had followed this royal canal which bore the name of naharmalcha the royal canal naharmalcha might be successively restored altered divided etc cellarius geograph antiq tom ii p     and these changes may serve to explain the seeming contradictions of antiquity in the time of julian it must have fallen into the euphrates below ctesiphon  the intermediate situation of coche would have separated the fleet and army of julian and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the tigris and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital must have been attended with the total destruction of the roman navy the prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger and provided the remedy as he had minutely studied the operations of trajan in the same country he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal which leaving coche on the right hand conveyed the waters of the naharmalcha into the river tigris at some distance above the cities from the information of the peasants julian ascertained the vestiges of this ancient work which were almost obliterated by design or accident by the indefatigable labor of the soldiers a broad and deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the euphrates a strong dike was constructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the naharmalcha a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed and the roman fleet steering their triumphant course into the tigris derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the persians of ctesiphon had erected to oppose their passage  as it became necessary to transport the roman passage of the tigris and victory of the romans army over the tigris another labor presented itself of less toil but of more danger than the preceding expedition the stream was broad and rapid the ascent steep and difficult and the intrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirassiers dextrous archers and huge elephants who according to the extravagant hyperbole of libanius could trample with the same ease a field of corn or a legion of romans  rien nest beau que le vrai a maxim which should be inscribed on the desk of every rhetorician  in the presence of such an enemy the construction of a bridge was impracticable and the intrepid prince who instantly seized the only possible expedient concealed his design till the moment of execution from the knowledge of the barbarians of his own troops and even of his generals themselves under the specious pretense of examining the state of the magazines fourscore vessels were gradually unladen and a select detachment apparently destined for some secret expedition was ordered to stand to their arms on the first signal julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy and amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of military games which he insultingly celebrated under the walls of coche the day was consecrated to pleasure but as soon as the hour of supper was past the emperor summoned the generals to his tent and acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of the tigris they stood in silent and respectful astonishment but when the venerable sallust assumed the privilege of his age and experience the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances libanius alludes to the most powerful of the generals i have ventured to name sallust ammianus says of all the leaders quod aeri metu territi duces concordi precatu fieri prohibere tentarent  julian contented himself with observing that conquest and safety depended on the attempt that instead of diminishing the number of their enemies would be increased by successive reinforcements and that a longer delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream nor level the height of the bank the signal was instantly given and obeyed the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence they were lost after a few moments in the darkness of the night a flame arose on the opposite side and julian who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels in attempting to land had been fired by the enemy dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory our fellow soldiers he eagerly exclaimed are already masters of the bank see  they make the appointed signal let us hasten to emulate and assist their courage the united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current and they reached the eastern shore of the tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames and rescue their adventurous companions the difficulties of a sleep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armor and the darkness of the night a shower of stones darts and fire was incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants who after an arduous struggle climbed the bank and stood victorious upon the rampart as soon as they possessed a more equal field julian who with his lightinfantry had led the attack hinc imperator says ammianus

missile weapons the whole engagement lasted above twelve hours till the gradual retreat of the persians was changed into a disorderly flight of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the surenas himself they were pursued to the gates of ctesiphon and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed city persas terrore subito miscuerunt versisque agminibus totius gentis

the north in full expectation that as he himself had victoriously penetrated to the capital of sapor the march and junction of his lieutenants sebastian and procopius would be executed with the same courage and diligence his expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the armenian king who permitted and most probably directed the desertion of his auxiliary troops from the camp of the

of this important reinforcement he condescended to hold a council of war and approved after a full debate the sentiment of those generals who dissuaded the siege of ctesiphon as a fruitless and pernicious undertaking it is not easy for us to conceive by what arts of fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of julian could be rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand romans commanded by a brave and experienced general and abundantly supplied with ships provisions battering engines and military stores but we may rest assured from the love of glory and contempt of danger which formed the character of julian that he was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles civitas inexpugnabilis facinus audax et importunum ammianus xxiv   his fellowsoldier eutropius turns aside from the difficulty assyriamque populatus castra apud ctesiphontem stativa aliquandiu habuit remeansque victor etc x    zosimus is artful or ignorant and socrates inaccurate  at the very time when he declined the siege of ctesiphon he rejected with obstinacy and disdain the most flattering offers of a negotiation of peace sapor who had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation of constantius was surprised by the intrepid diligence of his successor as far as the confines of india and scythia the satraps of the distant provinces were ordered to assemble their troops and to march without delay to the assistance of their monarch but their preparations were dilatory their motions slow and before sapor could lead an army into the field he received the melancholy intelligence of the devastation of assyria the ruin of his palaces and the slaughter of his bravest troops who defended the passage of the tigris the pride of royalty was humbled in the dust he took his repasts on the ground and the disorder of his hair expressed the grief and anxiety of his mind perhaps he would not have refused to purchase with one half of his kingdom the safety of the remainder and he would have gladly subscribed himself in a treaty of peace the faithful and dependent ally of the roman conqueror under the pretense of private business a minister of rank and confidence was secretly dispatched to embrace the knees of hormisdas and to request in the language of a suppliant that he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor the sassanian prince whether he listened to the voice of pride or humanity whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth or the duties of his situation was equally inclined to promote a salutary measure which would terminate the calamities of persia and secure the triumph of rome he was astonished by the inflexible firmness of a hero who remembered most unfortunately for himself and for his country that alexander had uniformly rejected the propositions of darius but as julian was sensible that the hope of a safe and honorable peace might cool the ardour of his troops he earnestly requested that hormisdas would privately dismiss the minister of sapor and conceal this dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp libanius orat parent c   0 p     c     p     socrates l iii

barbarians who defended the city to meet him on the open plain they prudently replied that if he desired to exercise his valor he might seek the army of the great king he felt the insult and he accepted the advice instead of confining his servile march to the banks of the euphrates and tigris he resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of alexander and boldly to advance into the inland provinces till he forced his rival to contend with him perhaps in the plains of arbela for the empire of asia the magnanimity of julian was applauded and betrayed by the arts of a noble persian who in the cause of his country had generously submitted to act a part full of danger of falsehood and of shame the arts of this new zopyrus greg nazianzen orat iv p         may derive some credit from the

chasm in the text of ammianus  with a train of faithful followers he deserted to the imperial camp exposed in a specious tale the injuries which he had sustained exaggerated the cruelty of sapor the discontent of the people and the weakness of the monarchy and confidently offered himself as the hostage and guide of the roman march the most rational grounds of suspicion were urged without effect by the wisdom and experience of hormisdas and the credulous julian receiving the traitor into his bosom was persuaded to issue an hasty order which in the opinion of mankind appeared to arraign his prudence and to endanger his safety he destroyed in a single hour the whole navy which had been transported above five hundred miles at so great an expense of toil of treasure and of blood twelve or at the most twentytwo small vessels were saved to accompany on carriages the march of the army and to form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers a supply of twenty days provisions was reserved for the use of the soldiers and the rest of the magazines with a fleet of eleven hundred vessels which rode at anchor in the tigris were abandoned to the flames by the absolute command of the emperor the christian bishops gregory and augustine insult the madness of the apostate who executed with his own hands the sentence of divine justice their authority of less weight perhaps in a

attempts a faint apology for his hero who according to ammianus pronounced his own condemnation by a tardy and ineffectual attempt to extinguish the flames  yet there are not wanting some specious and

xvi p  0   and tavernier p i l ii p      the distance of the lastmentioned city from the roman camp was not very considerable and julian must soon have renounced the vain and impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against the stream of a rapid river a celeritate tigris incipit vocari ita appellant medi sagittam plin hist nature vi     which in several places was embarrassed by

current of the river the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile labor and if the romans continued to march along the banks of the tigris they could only expect to return home without atchieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader if on the contrary it was advisable to advance into the inland country the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from the gates of ctesiphon had the arms of julian been victorious we should now admire the conduct as well as the courage of a hero who by depriving his soldiers of the hopes of a retreat left them only the alternative of death or conquest recollect

one of the most important cares of a prudent general and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from the enemys country had it been possible for julian to maintain a bridge of communication on the tigris and to preserve the conquered places of assyria a desolated province could not afford any large or regular supplies in a season of the year when the lands were covered by the inundation of the euphrates the tigris rises to the south the euphrates to the north of the armenian mountains the former overflows in march the latter in july these circumstances are well explained in the geographical dissertation of foster inserted in spelmans expedition of cyrus vol ii p     and the unwholesome air was darkened with swarms of innumerable insects ammianus xxiv

extensive region that lies between the river tigris and the mountains of media was filled with villages and towns and the fertile soil for the most part was in a very improved state of cultivation julian might expect that a conqueror who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion steel and gold would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives but on the approach of the romans this rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted wherever they moved the inhabitants deserted the open villages and took shelter in the fortified towns the cattle was driven away the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire and as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of julian he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert this desperate but effectual method of defense can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to their property or by the rigor of an arbitrary government which consults the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice on the present occasion the zeal and obedience of the persians seconded the commands of sapor and the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty stock of provisions which continually wasted in his hands before they were entirely consumed he might still have reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of ecbatana or

followers as soon as they were put to the torture confessed the secret of the conspiracy the visionary conquests of hyrcania and india which had so long amused now tormented the mind of julian conscious that his own imprudence was the cause of the public distress he anxiously balanced the hopes of safety or success without obtaining a satisfactory answer either from gods or men at length as the only practicable measure he embraced the resolution of directing his steps toward the banks of the tigris with the design of saving the army by a hasty march to the confines of corduene a fertile and friendly province which acknowledged the sovereignty of rome the desponding troops obeyed the signal of the retreat only seventy days after they had passed the chaboras with the sanguine june

roman army into the country their march was observed and insulted from a distance by several bodies of persian cavalry who showing themselves sometimes in loose and sometimes in closer order faintly skirmished with the advanced guards these detachments were however supported by a much greater force and the heads of the columns were no sooner pointed toward the tigris than a cloud of dust arose on the plain the romans who now aspired only to the permission of a safe and speedy retreat endeavored to persuade themselves that this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild asses or perhaps by the approach of some friendly arabs they halted pitched their tents fortified their camp passed the whole night in continual alarms and discovered at the dawn of day that they were surrounded by an army of persians this army which might be considered only as the van of the barbarians was soon followed by the main body of cuirassiers archers and elephants commanded by meranes a general of rank and reputation he was accompanied by two of the kings sons and many of the principal satraps and fame and expectation exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers which slowly advanced under the conduct of sapor himself as the romans continued their march their long array which was forced to bend or divide according to the varieties of the ground afforded frequent and favorable opportunities to their vigilant enemies the persians repeatedly charged with fury they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness and the action at maronga which almost deserved the name of a battle was marked by a considerable loss of satraps and elephants perhaps of equal value in the eyes of their monarch these splendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate slaughter on the side of the romans several officers of distinction were either killed or wounded and the emperor himself who on all occasions of danger inspired and guided the valor of his troops was obliged to expose his person and exert his abilities the weight of offensive and defensive arms which still constituted the strength and safety of the romans disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit and as the horsemen of the east were trained to dart their javelins and shoot their arrows at full speed and in every possible direction chardin the most judicious of modern travelers describes tom iii p       etc edit in   to the education and dexterity of the persian horsemen brissonius de regno persico p   0     etc has collected the testimonies of antiquity  the cavalry of persia was never more formidable than in the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight but the most certain and irreparable loss of the romans was that of time the hardy veterans accustomed to the cold climate of gaul and germany fainted under the sultry heat of an assyrian summer their vigor was exhausted by the incessant repetition of march and combat and the progress of the army was suspended by the precautions of a slow and dangerous retreat in the presence of an active enemy every day every hour as the supply diminished the value and price of subsistence increased in the roman camp in mark

himself with such food as a hungry soldier would have disdained distributed for the use of the troops the provisions of the imperial household and whatever could be spared from the sumpterhorses of the tribunes and generals but this feeble relief served only to aggravate the sense of the public distress and the romans began to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that before they could reach the frontiers of the empire they should all perish either by famine or by the sword of the barbarians ammian xxiv   xxv   zosimus l iii p             libanius orat parent c         p             the

superstition and the trumpets sounded at the break of day the army marched through a hilly country and the hills had been secretly occupied by the persians julian led the van with the skill and attention of a consummate general he was alarmed by the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked the heat of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass but he snatched a shield from one of his attendants and hastened with a sufficient reinforcement to the relief of the rearguard a similar danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defense of the front and as he galloped between the columns the center of the left was attacked and almost overpowered by a furious charge of the persian cavalry and elephants this huge body was soon defeated by the welltimed evolution of the light infantry who aimed their weapons with dexterity and effect against the backs of the horsemen and the legs of the elephants the barbarians fled and julian who was foremost in every danger animated the pursuit with his voice and gestures his trembling guards scattered and oppressed by the disorderly throng of friends and enemies reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without armor and

the wounded emperor was gently raised from the ground and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle into an adjacent tent the report of the melancholy event passed from rank to rank but the grief of the romans inspired them with invincible valor and the desire of revenge the bloody and obstinate conflict was maintained by the two armies till they were separated by the total darkness of the night the persians derived some honor from the advantage which they obtained against the left wing where anatolius master of the offices was slain and the prefect sallust very narrowly escaped but the event of the day was adverse to the barbarians they abandoned the field their two generals meranes and nohordates sapor himself declared to the romans that it was his practice to comfort the families of his

to rush into the battle his remaining strength was exhausted by the painful effort and the surgeons who examined his wound discovered the symptoms of approaching death he employed the awful moments with the firm temper of a hero and a sage the philosophers who had accompanied him in this fatal expedition compared the tent of julian with the prison of socrates and the spectators whom duty or friendship or curiosity had assembled round his couch listened with respectful grief to the funeral oration of their dying emperor the character and situation of julian might countenance the suspicion

conscious immortality see warburtons learned and rational observations divine legation vol ii p           the spectators were silent and julian entered into a metaphysical argument with the philosophers priscus and maximus on the nature of the soul the efforts which he made of mind as well as body most probably hastened his death his wound began to bleed with fresh violence his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling of the veins he called for a draught of cold water and as soon as he had drank it expired without pain about the hour of midnight such was the end of that extraordinary man in the thirtysecond year of his age after a reign of one year and about eight months from the death of constantius in his last moments he displayed perhaps with some ostentation the love of virtue and of fame which had been the ruling passions of his life the whole relation of the death of julian is given by ammianus xxv   an intelligent spectator libanius who turns with horror

christianity and the calamities election of the emperor jovian a d     june    of the empire may in some measure be ascribed to julian himself who had neglected to secure the future execution of his designs by the timely and judicious nomination of an associate and successor but the royal race of constantius chlorus was reduced to his own person and if he entertained any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among the romans he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the choice the jealousy of power the fear of ingratitude and the natural presumption of health of youth and of prosperity his unexpected death left the empire without a master and without an heir in a state of perplexity and danger which in the space of fourscore years had never been experienced since the election of diocletian in a government which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood the superiority of birth was of little moment the claims of official rank were accidental and precarious and the candidates who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of personal merit or by the hopes of popular favor but the situation of a famished army encompassed on all sides by an host of barbarians shortened the moments of grief and deliberation in this scene of terror and distress the body of the deceased prince according to his own directions was decently embalmed and at the dawn of day the generals convened a military senate at which the commanders of the legions and the officers both of cavalry and infantry were invited to assist three or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret cabals and when the election of an emperor was proposed the spirit of faction began to agitate the assembly victor and arinthaeus collected the remains of the court of constantius the friends of julian attached themselves to the gallic chiefs dagalaiphus and nevitta and the most fatal consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two factions so opposite in their character and interest in their maxims of government and perhaps in their religious principles the superior virtues of sallust could alone reconcile their divisions and unite their suffrages and the venerable prefect would immediately have been declared the successor of julian if he himself with sincere and modest firmness had not alleged his age and infirmities so unequal to the weight of the diadem the generals who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal showed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior officer honoratior aliquis miles perhaps ammianus himself the modest and judicious historian describes the scene of the election at which he was undoubtedly present xxv    that they should act as they would have acted in the absence of the emperor that they should exert their abilities to extricate the army from the present distress and if they were fortunate enough

extremities of the line the new prince astonished with his own fortune was hastily invested with the imperial ornaments and received an oath of fidelity from the generals whose favor and protection he so lately solicited the strongest recommendation of jovian was the merit of his father count varronian who enjoyed in honorable retirement the fruit of his long services in the obscure freedom of a private station the son indulged his taste for wine and women yet he supported with credit the character of a christian the ecclesiastical historians socrates l iii c    sozomen l vi c   and theodoret l iv c   ascribe to jovian the merit of a confessor under the preceding reign and piously suppose that he refused the purple till the whole army unanimously exclaimed that they were christians ammianus calmly pursuing his narrative overthrows the legend by a single sentence hostiis pro joviano extisque inspectis pronuntiatum est etc xxv   and a soldier without being conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of mankind the comely person of jovian his cheerful temper and familiar wit had gained the affection of his fellow soldiers and the generals of both parties acquiesced in a popular election which had not been conducted by the arts of their enemies the pride of this unexpected elevation was moderated by the just apprehension that the same day might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor the pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without delay and the first orders issued by jovian a few hours after his predecessor had expired were to prosecute a march which could alone extricate the romans from their actual distress ammianus xxx  0 has drawn from the life an impartial portrait of jovian to which the younger victor

with a great slaughter of men and elephants and the army after marching and fighting a long summers day arrived in the evening at samara on the banks of the tigris about one hundred miles above

their rashness by representing that if they possessed sufficient skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream they would only deliver themselves naked and defenseless to the barbarians who had occupied the opposite banks yielding at length to their clamorous importunities he consented with reluctance that five hundred gauls and germans accustomed from their infancy to the

may distrust the fairness of libanius the ocular testimony of eutropius uno a persis atque altero proelio victus x    must incline us to suspect that ammianus has been too jealous of the honor of the roman arms   in this hopeless situation the fainting spirits of negotiation and treaty of peace july the romans were revived by the sound of peace the transient presumption of sapor had vanished he observed with serious concern that in the repetition of doubtful combats he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles his bravest troops and the greatest part of his train of elephants and the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair the vicissitudes of fortune and the unexhausted powers of the roman empire which might soon advance to relieve or to revenge the

dismiss the caesar with the relics of his captive army the hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the romans the emperor was compelled by the advice of his council and the cries of the soldiers to embrace the offer of peace and the prefect sallust was immediately sent with the general arinthaeus to understand the pleasure of the great king the crafty persian delayed under various pretenses the conclusion of the agreement started difficulties required explanations suggested expedients receded from his concessions increased his demands and wasted four days in the arts of negotiation till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet remained in the camp of the romans had jovian been capable of executing a bold and prudent measure he would have continued his march with unremitting diligence the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the barbarians and before the expiration of the fourth day he might have safely reached the fruitful province of corduene at the distance only of one hundred miles it is presumptuous to controvert the opinion of ammianus a soldier and a spectator yet it is difficult to understand how the mountains of corduene could extend over the plain of assyria as low as the conflux of the tigris and the great zab or how an army of sixty thousand men could march one hundred miles in four days  the irresolute emperor instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy expected his fate with patient resignation and accepted the humiliating conditions of peace which it was no longer in his power to refuse the five provinces beyond the tigris which had been ceded by the grandfather of sapor were restored to the persian monarchy he acquired by a single article the impregnable city of nisibis which had sustained in three successive sieges the effort of his arms singara and the castle of the moors one of the strongest places of mesopotamia were likewise dismembered from the empire it was considered as an indulgence that the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their effects but the conqueror rigorously insisted that the romans should for ever abandon the king and kingdom of armenia a peace or rather a long truce of thirty years was stipulated between the hostile nations the faith of the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and religious ceremonies and hostages of distinguished rank

libanius of not meeting with a refusal if he had fixed as the boundary of persia the orontes the cydnus the sangarius or even the thracian bosphorus flatterers would not have been wanting in the court

full force this malicious insinuation we must acknowledge that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by the private ambition of jovian the obscure domestic exalted to the throne by fortune rather than by merit was impatient to escape from the hands of the persians that he might prevent the designs of procopius who commanded the army of mesopotamia and establish his doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which were still ignorant of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the tigris conditionibus dispendiosis romanae reipublicae impositis quibus cupidior

their native country to the resentment of a victorious monarch the difference of their conduct and success depended much more on their character than on their situation instead of tamely resigning themselves to the secret deliberations and private views of a single person the united councils of the greeks were inspired by the generous enthusiasm of a popular assembly where the mind of each citizen is filled with the love of glory the pride of freedom and the contempt of death conscious of their superiority over the barbarians in arms and discipline they disdained to yield they refused to capitulate every obstacle was surmounted by their patience courage and military skill and the memorable retreat of the ten thousand exposed and insulted the weakness of the persian monarchy the cyropaedia is vague and languid the anabasis circumstantial and animated such is the eternal difference between fiction and truth   as the price of his disgraceful concessions the he continues his retreat to nisibis emperor might perhaps have stipulated that the camp of the hungry romans should be plentifully supplied according to rufinus an immediate supply of provisions was stipulated by the treaty and theodoret affirms that the obligation was faithfully discharged by the persians such a fact is probable but undoubtedly false see tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p  0   and that they should be permitted to pass the tigris on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the persians but if jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms they were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the east whose clemency had pardoned the invaders of his country the saracens sometimes intercepted the stragglers of the march but the generals and troops of sapor respected the cessation of arms and jovian was suffered to explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river the small vessels which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet performed the most essential service they first conveyed the emperor and his favorites and afterward transported in many successive voyages a great part of the army but as every man was anxious for his personal safety and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore the soldiers who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the boats boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles or inflated skins and drawing after them their horses attempted with various success to swim across the river many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves many others who were carried along by the violence of the stream fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of the wild arabs and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of the tigris was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle as soon as the romans had landed on the western bank they were delivered from the hostile pursuit of the barbarians but in a laborious march of two hundred miles over the plains of mesopotamia they endured the last extremities of thirst and hunger they were obliged to traverse a sandy desert which in the extent of seventy miles did not afford a single blade of sweet grass nor a single spring of fresh water and the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of friends or enemies whenever a small measure of flour could be discovered in the camp twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased with ten pieces of gold we may recollect some lines of lucan pharsal iv    who describes a similar distress of caesars army in spain saeva fames aderat  miles eget toto censu non prodigus

persuasion that the temples of the gods would be enriched with the spoils of the east that persia would be reduced to the humble state of a tributary province governed by the laws and magistrates of

relinquished the five provinces which had been acquired by the victory of galerius and that he shamefully surrendered to the barbarians the important city of nisibis the firmest bulwark of the provinces of the east ammianus and eutropius may be admitted as fair and credible witnesses of the public language and opinions the people of antioch reviled an ignominious peace which exposed them to the persians on a naked and defenseless frontier excerpt valesiana p     ex johanne antiocheno  the deep and dangerous question how far the public faith should be observed when it becomes incompatible with the public safety was freely agitated in popular conversation and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would redeem his pusillanimous behavior by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy the inflexible spirit of the roman senate had always disclaimed the unequal conditions which were extorted from the distress of her captive armies and if it were necessary to satisfy the national honor by delivering the guilty general into the hands of the barbarians the greatest part of the subjects of jovian would have cheerfully acquiesced in the precedent of ancient times the abbe de la bleterie hist de jovien tom i p          though a severe casuist has pronounced that jovian was not bound to execute his promise since he could not dismember the empire nor alienate without their consent the

jovian evacuates nisibis and restores the five provinces to the persians august master of the laws and arms of the state and the same motives which had forced him to subscribe now pressed him to execute the treaty of peace he was impatient to secure an empire at the expense of a few provinces and the respectable names of religion and honor concealed the personal fears and the ambition of jovian notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants decency as well as prudence forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of nisibis but the next morning after his arrival bineses the ambassador of persia entered the place displayed from the citadel the standard of the great king and proclaimed in his name the cruel alternative of exile or servitude the principal citizens of nisibis who till that fatal moment had confided in the protection of their sovereign threw themselves at his feet they conjured him not to abandon or at least not to deliver a faithful colony to the rage of a barbarian tyrant exasperated by the three successive defeats which he had experienced under the walls of nisibis they still possessed arms and courage to repel the invaders of their country they requested only the permission of using them in their own defense and as soon as they had asserted their independence they should implore the favor of being again admitted into the rank of his subjects their arguments their eloquence their tears were ineffectual jovian alleged with some confusion the sanctity of oaths and as the reluctance with which he accepted the present of a crown of gold convinced the citizens of their hopeless condition the advocate sylvanus was provoked to exclaim o emperor may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions jovian who in a few weeks

universal despair which he seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion see xxv   and zosimus l iii p          the martial youth deserted with indignant grief the walls which they had so gloriously defended the disconsolate mourner dropped a last tear over the tomb of a son or husband which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a barbarian master and the aged citizen kissed the threshold and clung to the doors of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy the highways were crowded with a trembling multitude the distinctions of rank and sex and age were lost in the general calamity every one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of his fortunes and as they could not command the immediate service of an adequate number of horses or wagons they were obliged to leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects the savage insensibility of jovian appears to have aggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives they were seated however in a newbuilt quarter of amida and that rising city with the reinforcement of a very considerable colony soon recovered its former splendor and became the capital of mesopotamia chron paschal

this sudden death was variously understood by some it was ascribed to the death of jovian feb    consequences of an indigestion occasioned either by the quantity of the wine or the quality of the

    we cannot expect a perfect agreement and we shall not discuss minute differences  but the want of a regular enquiry into the death of a prince whose reign and person were soon forgotten appears to have been the only circumstance which countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt ammianus unmindful of his usual candor and good sense compares the death of the harmless jovian to that of the second africanus who had excited the fears and resentment of the popular faction  the body of jovian was sent to constantinople to be interred with his predecessors and the sad procession was met on the road by his wife charito the daughter of count lucillian who still wept the recent death of her father and was hastening to dry her tears in the embraces of an imperial husband her disappointment and grief were embittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness six weeks before the death of jovian his infant son had been placed in the curule chair adorned with the title of nobilissimus and the vain ensigns of the consulship unconscious of his fortune the royal youth who from his grandfather assumed the name of varronian was reminded only by the jealousy of the government that he was the son of an emperor sixteen years afterward he was still alive but he had already been deprived of an eye and his afflicted mother expected every hour that the innocent victim

that the generals might command the expeditious use of the public posts for themselves their attendants and messengers   that the troops for the ease of the cities marched in many divisions and that the head of the column might arrive at nice when the rear halted at ancyra without a master the ministers and generals still continued vacancy of the throne feb        to meet in council to exercise

the civil and military powers of the empire the diadem was again unanimously offered to the prefect sallust he enjoyed the glory of a second refusal and when the virtues of the father were alleged in favor of his son the prefect with the firmness of a disinterested patriot declared to the electors that the feeble age of the one and the unexperienced youth of the other were equally incapable of the laborious duties of government several candidates were proposed and after weighing the objections of character or situation they were successively rejected but as soon as the name of valentinian was pronounced the merit of that officer united the suffrages of the whole assembly and obtained the sincere approbation of sallust himself valentinian ammianus xxx     and the younger victor have furnished the portraits of valentinian which naturally precedes and illustrates the history of his reign was the son of count gratian a native of cibalis election and character of valentinian in pannonia who from an obscure condition had raised himself by matchless strength and dexterity to the military commands of africa and britain from which he retired with an ample fortune and suspicious integrity the rank and services of gratian contributed however to smooth the first steps of the promotion of his son and afforded him an early opportunity of displaying those solid and useful qualifications which raised his character above the ordinary level of his fellow soldiers the person of valentinian was tall graceful and majestic his manly countenance deeply marked with the impression of sense and spirit inspired his friends with awe and his enemies with fear and to second the efforts of his undaunted courage the son of gratian had inherited the advantages of a strong and healthy constitution by the habits of chastity and temperance which restrain the appetites and invigorate the faculties valentinian preserved his own and the public esteem the avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of literature he was ignorant of the greek language and the arts of rhetoric but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid perplexity he was able as often as the occasion prompted him to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution the laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had studied and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence and inflexible severity with which he discharged and enforced the duties of the camp in the time of julian he provoked the danger of disgrace

party in their favor should appear in public on the day of the inauguration yet such was the prevalence of ancient superstition that a whole day was voluntarily added to this dangerous interval

in martial order round the tribunal but when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude a busy whisper was accidentally started in the ranks and insensibly swelled into a loud and imperious clamor that he should name without delay a colleague in the empire the intrepid calmness of valentinian obtained silence and commanded respect and he thus addressed the assembly a few

however to mark that procopius was a pagan yet his religion does not appear to have promoted or obstructed his pretensions  he endeavored by his dutiful and submissive behavior to disarm the jealousy of jovian resigned without a contest his military command and retired with his wife and family to cultivate the ample patrimony which he possessed in the province of cappadocia these useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers who in the name of his new sovereigns valentinian and valens was dispatched to conduct the unfortunate procopius either to a perpetual prison or an ignominious death his presence of mind procured him a longer respite and a more splendid fate without presuming to dispute the royal mandate he requested the indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family and while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment he dexterously escaped to the seacoast of the euxine from whence he passed over to the country of bosphorus in that sequestered region he remained many months exposed to the hardships of exile of solitude and of want his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes and his mind agitated by the just apprehension that if any accident should discover his name the faithless barbarians would violate without much scruple the laws of hospitality in a moment of impatience and despair procopius embarked in a merchant vessel which made sail for constantinople and boldly aspired to the rank of a sovereign because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a subject at first he lurked in the villages of bithynia continually changing his habitation and his disguise one of his retreats was a country house of eunomius the heretic the master was absent

east they despised the character of valens which was rude without vigor and feeble without mildness they dreaded the influence of his fatherinlaw the patrician petronius a cruel and rapacious minister who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that might remain unpaid since the reign of the emperor aurelian the circumstances were propitious to the designs of an usurper the hostile measures of the persians required the presence of valens in syria from the danube to the euphrates the troops were in motion and the capital was occasionally filled with the soldiers who passed or repassed the thracian bosphorus two cohorts of gauls were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the conspirators which were recommended by the promise of a liberal donative and as they still revered the memory of julian they easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his proscribed kinsman at the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of anastasia and procopius clothed in a purple garment more suitable to a player than to a monarch appeared as if he rose from the dead in the midst of constantinople the soldiers who were prepared for his reception saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity their numbers were soon increased by a sturdy band of peasants collected from the adjacent country and procopius shielded by the arms of his adherents was successively conducted to the tribunal the senate and the palace during the first moments of his tumultuous reign he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence of the people who were either ignorant of the cause or apprehensive of the event but his military strength was superior to any actual resistance the malcontents flocked to the standard of rebellion the poor were excited by the hopes and the rich were intimidated by the fear of a general pillage and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution the magistrates were seized the prisons and arsenals broke open the gates and the entrance of the harbor were diligently occupied and in a few hours procopius became the absolute though precarious master of the imperial city the usurper improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and dexterity he artfully propagated the rumors and opinions the most favorable to his interest while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent but imaginary ambassadors of distant nations the large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of thrace and the fortresses of the lower danube were gradually involved in the guilt of rebellion and the gothic princes consented to supply the sovereign of constantinople with the formidable strength of several thousand auxiliaries his generals passed

in his favor the event of the civil war in a season of tranquillity sallust had resigned without a murmur but as soon as the public safety was attacked he ambitiously solicited the preeminence of toil and danger and the restoration of that virtuous minister to the praefecture of the east was the first step which indicated the repentance of valens and satisfied the minds of the people the reign of

secure the patient submission of his people the favorites of valens obtained by the privilege of rapine and confiscation the wealth which his economy would have refused i have transferred the reproach of avarice from valens to his servants avarice more properly belongs to ministers than to kings in whom that passion is commonly extinguished by absolute possession  they urged with persuasive eloquence that in all cases of treason suspicion is equivalent to proof that the power supposes the intention of mischief that the intention is not less criminal than the act and that a subject no longer deserves to live if his life may threaten the safety or disturb the repose of his sovereign the judgment of valentinian was sometimes deceived and his confidence abused but he would have silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile had they presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger they praised his inflexible love of justice and in the pursuit of justice the emperor was easily tempted to consider clemency as a weakness and passion as a virtue as long as he wrestled with his equals in the bold competition of an active and ambitious life valentinian was seldom injured and never insulted with impunity if his prudence was arraigned his spirit was applauded and the proudest and most powerful generals were apprehensive of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier after he became master of the world he unfortunately forgot that where no resistance can be made no courage can be exerted and instead of consulting the dictates of reason and magnanimity he indulged the furious emotions of his temper at a time when they were disgraceful to himself and fatal to the defenseless objects of his displeasure in the government of his household or of his empire slight or even imaginary offenses a hasty word a casual omission an involuntary delay were chastised by a sentence of immediate death the expressions which issued the most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the west were strike off his head burn him alive let him be beaten with clubs till he expires he sometimes expressed a sentence of death with a tone of pleasantry abi comes et muta ei caput qui sibi mutari provinciam cupit a boy who had slipped too hastily a spartan hound an armourer who had made a polished cuirass that wanted some grains of the legitimate weight etc were the victims of his fury  and his most favored ministers soon understood that by a rash attempt to dispute or suspend the execution of his sanguinary commands they might involve themselves in the guilt and punishment of disobedience the repeated gratification of this savage justice hardened the mind of valentinian against pity and remorse and the sallies of passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty the innocents of milan were an agent and three apparitors whom valentinian condemned for signifying a legal summons ammianus xxvii   strangely supposes that all who had been unjustly executed were worshipped as martyrs by the christians his impartial silence does not allow us to believe that the great chamberlain rhodanus was burnt alive for an act of oppression chron paschal p  0   he could behold with calm satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture and death he reserved his friendship for those faithful servants whose temper was the most congenial to his own the merit of maximin who had slaughtered the noblest families of rome was rewarded with the royal approbation and the praefecture of gaul two fierce and enormous bears distinguished by the appellations of innocence and mica aurea could alone deserve to share the favor of maximin the cages of those trusty guards were always placed near the bedchamber of valentinian who frequently amused his eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were abandoned to their rage their diet and exercises were carefully inspected by the roman emperor and when innocence had earned her discharge by a long course of meritorious service the faithful animal was again restored to the freedom of her native woods ut been meritam in sylvas jussit abire innoxiam ammian xxix   and valesius ad locum   but in the calmer moments of reflection when the mind of valens was not agitated by fear or that of valentinian by rage the tyrant resumed their laws and government the sentiments or at least the conduct of the father of his country the dispassionate judgment of the western emperor could clearly perceive and accurately pursue his own and the public interest and the sovereign of the east who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the prefect sallust both princes invariably retained in the purple the chaste and temperate simplicity which had adorned their private life and under their reign the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh they gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of constantius judiciously adopted and improved the designs of julian and his successor and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might inspire posterity with the most favorable opinion of their character and government it is not from the master of innocence that we should expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects which prompted valentinian to condemn the exposition of newborn infants see the code of justinian l viii tit lii leg   unusquisque sobolem suam nutriat quod si exponendam

treated the interesting subject with the zeal and curiosity of a man of letters who studies his domestic history  it was his intention that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught in the greek and latin languages in the metropolis of every province and as the size and dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of the city the academies of rome and constantinople claimed a just and singular preeminence the fragments of the literary edicts of valentinian imperfectly represent the school of constantinople which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations that school consisted of thirtyone professors in different branches of learning one philosopher and two lawyers five sophists and ten grammarians for the greek and three orators and ten grammarians for the latin tongue besides seven scribes or as they were then styled antiquarians whose laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the elassic writers the rule of conduct which was prescribed to the students is the more curious as it affords the first outlines of the form and discipline of a modern university it was required that they should bring proper certificates from the magistrates of their native province their names professions and places of abode were regularly entered in a public register the studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in feasts or in the theater and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty the prefect of the city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public service the institutions of valentinian contributed to secure the benefits of peace and plenty and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the defensors cod theodos l i tit xi with godefroys paratitlon which diligently gleans from the rest of the code  freely elected as the tribunes and advocates of the people to support their rights and to expose their grievances before the tribunals of the civil magistrates or even at the foot of the imperial throne the finances were diligently administered by two princes who had been so long accustomed to the rigid economy of a private fortune but in the receipt and application of the revenue a discerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the east and of the west valens was persuaded that royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression and his ambition never aspired to secure by their actual distress the future strength and prosperity of his people instead of increasing the weight of taxes which in the space of fortyyears had been gradually doubled he reduced in the first years of his reign onefourth of the tribute of the east three lines from ammianus xxxi    countenance a whole oration of themistius viii p  0     0 full of adulation pedantry and commonplace morality the eloquent m thomas tom i p          has amused himself with celebrating the virtues and genius of themistius who was not unworthy of the age in which he lived  valentinian appears to have been less attentive and less anxious to relieve the burdens of his people he might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration but he exacted without scruple a very large share of the private property as he was convinced that the revenues which supported the luxury of individuals would be much more advantageously employed for the defense and improvement of the state the subjects of the east who enjoyed the present benefit applauded the indulgence of their prince the solid but less splendid merit of valentinian was felt and acknowledged by the subsequent generation zosimus l iv p  0  ammian xxx   his reformation of costly abuses might entitle him to the praise of in provinciales admodum parcus tributorum ubique molliens sarcinas by some his frugality was styled ayarice jerome chron p       but the most honorable circumstance of the valentinian maintains the religious toleration a d          character of valentinian is the firm and temperate impartiality which he uniformly preserved in an age of religious contention his strong sense unenlightened but uncorrupted by study declined with respectful indifference the subtle questions of theological debate the government of the earth claimed his vigilance and satisfied his ambition and while he remembered that he was the disciple of the church he never forgot that he was the sovereign of the clergy under the reign of an apostate he had signalized his zeal for the honor of christianity he allowed to his subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself and they might accept with gratitude and confidence the general toleration which was granted by a prince addicted to passion but incapable of fear or of disguise testes sunt leges a me in exordio imperii mei datae quibus unicuique quod animo imbibisset colendi libera facultas tributa est cod theodos l ix tit xvi leg   to this declaration of valentinian we may add the various testimonies of ammianus xxx   zosimus l iv p  0  and sozomen l vi c      baronius would naturally blame such rational toleration annal eccles a d   0 no          a d     no      the pagans the jews and all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of christ were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or popular insult nor was any mode of worship prohibited by valentinian except those secret and criminal practices which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder the art of magic as it was more cruelly punished was more strictly proscribed but the emperor admitted a formal distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination which were approved by the senate and exercised by the tuscan haruspices he had condemned with the consent of the most rational pagans the license of nocturnal sacrifices but he immeately admitted the petition of praetextatus proconsul of achaia who represented that the life of the greeks would become dreary and comfortless if they were deprived of the invaluable blessing of the eleusinian mysteries philosophy alone can boast and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism but this truce of twelve years which was enforced by the wise and vigorous government of valentinian by suspending the repetition of mutual injuries contributed to soften the manners and abate the prejudices of the religious factions  the friend of toleration was unfortunately valens professes arianism and persecutes the catholics a d          placed at a distance from the scene of the fiercest controversies as soon as the christians of the west had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of rimini they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy and the small remains of the arian party that still subsisted at sirmium or milan might be considered rather as objects of contempt than of resentment but in the provinces of the east from the euxine to the extremity of thebais the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally balanced and this equality instead of recommending the counsels of peace served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war the monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows athanasius still reigned at alexandria the thrones of constantinople and antioch were occupied by arian prelates and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult the homoousians were fortified by the reconciliation of fiftynine macedonian or semiarian bishops but their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the holy ghost clouded the splendor of the triumph and the declaration of valens who in the first years of his reign had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother was an important victory on the side of arianism the two brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens but the piety of valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of baptism before he exposed his person to the dangers of a gothic war he naturally addressed himself to eudoxus eudoxus was of a mild and timid disposition when he baptized valens a d     he must have been extremely old since he had studied theology fiftyfive years before under lucian a learned and pious martyr philostorg

principles of heterodox theology his misfortune rather than his guilt was the inevitable consequence of his erroneous choice whatever had been the determination of the emperor he must have offended a numerous party of his christian subjects as the leaders both of the homoousians and of the arians believed that if they were not suffered to reign they were most cruelly injured and oppressed after he had taken this decisive step it was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue or the reputation of impartiality he never aspired like constantius to the fame of a profound theologian but as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of eudoxus valens resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides and promoted by the influence of his authority the reunion of the athanasian heretics to the body of the catholic church at first he pitied their blindness by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of hatred gregory nazianzen orat xxv p     insults the persecuting spirit of the arians as an infallible symptom of error and heresy  the feeble mind of valens was always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed and the exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favors the most readily granted in a despotic court such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the homoousian party and the misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of constantinople who perhaps accidentally were burnt on shipboard was imputed to the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor and his arian ministers in every contest the catholics if we may anticipate that name were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults and of those of their adversaries in every election the claims of the arian candidate obtained the preference and if they were opposed by the majority of the people he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate or even by the terrors of a military force the enemies of athanasius attempted to disturb the last years of his venerable age and his temporary retreat to his fathers sepulcher has been celebrated as a fifth exile but the zeal of a great people who instantly flew to arms intimidated the prefect and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory after a reign of fortyseven years the death of athanasius was the signal death of athanasius a d     may  d of the persecution of egypt and the pagan minister of valens who forcibly seated the worthless lucius on the archiepiscopal throne purchased the favor of the reigning party by the blood and sufferings of their christian brethren the free toleration of the heathen and jewish worship was bitterly lamented as a circumstance which aggravated the misery of the catholics and the guilt of the impious tyrant of the east this sketch of the ecclesiastical government of valens is drawn from socrates l iv sozomen l vi theodoret l iv and the immense compilations of tillemont particularly tom vi viii and ix   the triumph of the orthodox party has left a just idea of his persecution deep stain of persecution on the memory of valens and the character of a prince who derived his virtues as well as his vices from a feeble understanding and a pusillanimous temper scarcely deserves the labor of an apology yet candor may discover some reasons to suspect that the ecclesiastical ministers of valens often exceeded the orders or even the intentions of their master and that the real measure of facts has been very liberally magnified by the vehement declamation and easy credulity of his antagonists dr jortin remarks on ecclesiastical history vol iv p    has already conceived and intimated the same suspicion    the silence of valentinian may suggest a probable argument that the partial severities which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from the established system of religious toleration and the judicious historian who has praised the equal temper of the elder brother has not thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of the west with the cruel persecution of the east this reflection is so obvious and forcible that orosius l vii c       delays the persecution till after the death of valentinian socrates on the other hand supposes l iii c    that it was appeased by a philosophical oration which themistius pronounced in the year     orat xii p     in latin only such contradictions diminish the evidence and reduce the term of the persecution of valens    whatever credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports the character or at least the behavior of valens may be most distinctly seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent basil archbishop of caesarea who had succeeded athanasius in the management of the trinitarian cause tillemont whom i follow and abridge has extracted mem eccles tom

   0 do not present the image of a very lively persecution  the circumstantial narrative has been composed by the friends and admirers of basil and as soon as we have stripped away a thick coat of rhetoric and miracle we shall be astonished by the unexpected mildness of the arian tyrant who admired the firmness of his character or was apprehensive if he employed violence of a general revolt in the province of cappadocia the archbishop who asserted with inflexible pride basilius caesariensis episcopus cappadociae clarus habetur qui multa continentiae et ingenii bona uno superbiae malo perdidit this irreverent passage is perfectly in the style and character of st jerome it does not appear in scaligers edition of his chronicle but isaac vossius found it in some old mss which had not been reformed by the monks  the truth of his opinions and the dignity of his rank was left in the free possession of his conscience and his throne the emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn service of the cathedral and instead of a sentence of banishment subscribed the donation of a valuable estate for the use of an hospital which basil had lately founded in the neighborhood of caesarea this noble and charitable foundation almost a new city surpassed in merit if not in greatness the pyramids or the walls of babylon it was principally intended for the reception of lepers greg nazianzen orat xx p        i am not able to discover that any law such as theodosius afterward enacted against the arians was published by valens against the athanasian sectaries and the edict which excited the most violent clamours may not appear so extremely reprehensible the emperor had observed that several of his subjects gratifying their lazy disposition under the pretense of religion had associated themselves with the monks of egypt and he directed the count of the east to drag them from their solitude and to compel those deserters of society to accept the fair alternative of renouncing their temporal possessions or of discharging the public duties of men and citizens cod theodos l xii tit i leg    godefroy tom iv p  0       performs the duty of a commentator and advocate tillemont mem eccles tom viii p  0  supposes a scond law to excuse his orthodox friends who had misrepresented the edict of valens and suppressed the liberty of choice  the ministers of valens seem to have extended the sense of this penal statute since they claimed a right of enlisting the young and ablebodied monks in the imperial armies a detachment of cavalry and infantry consisting of three thousand men marched from alexandria into the adjacent desert of nitria see danville description de legypte p    hereafter i shall consider the monastic institutions  which was peopled by five thousand monks the

miracles   the strict regulations which had been framed valentinian restrains the avarice of the clergy a d   0 by the wisdom of modern legislators to restrain the wealth and avarice of the clergy may be originally deduced from the example of the emperor valentinian his edict cod theodos l xvi tit ii leg  0 godefroy tom vi p    after the example of baronius impartially collects all that the fathers have said on the subject of this important law whose spirit was long afterward revived by the emperor frederic ii edward i of england and other christian princes who reigned after the twelfth century addressed to damasus bishop of rome was publicly read in the churches of the city he admonished the ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and virgins and menaced their disobedience with the animadversion of the civil judge the director was no longer permitted to receive any gift or legacy or inheritance from the liberality of his spiritual daughter every testament contrary to this edict was declared null and void and the illegal donation was confiscated for the use of the treasury by a subsequent regulation it should seem that the same provisions were extended to nuns and bishops and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts and strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance as the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue valentinian applied this severe remedy to the growing evil in the capital of the empire the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property and many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of christianity not only with the cold assent of the understanding but with the warmth of affection and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion they sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury and renounced for the praise of chastity the soft endearments of conjugal society some ecclesiastic of real or apparent sanctity was chosen to direct their timorous conscience and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart and the unbounded confidence which they hastily bestowed was often abused by knaves and enthusiasts who hastened from the extremities of the east to enjoy on a splendid theater the privileges of the monastic profession by their contempt of the world they insensibly acquired its most desirable advantages the lively attachment perhaps of a young and beautiful woman the delicate plenty of an opulent household and the respectful homage of the slaves the freedmen and the clients of a senatorial family the immense fortunes of the roman ladies were gradually consumed in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages and the artful monk who had assigned himself the first or possibly the sole place in the testament of his spiritual daughter still presumed to declare with the smooth face of hypocrisy that he was only the instrument of charity and the steward of the poor the lucrative but disgraceful trade the expressions which i have used are temperate and feeble if compared with the vehement invectives of jerome tom i p           etc in his turn he was reproached with the guilt which he imputed to his brother monks and the sceleratus the versipellis was publicly accused as the lover of the widow paula tom ii p     he undoubtedly possessed the affections both of the mother and the daughter but he declares that he never abused his influence to any selfish or sensual purpose  which was exercised by the clergy to defraud the expectations of the natural heirs had provoked the indignation of a superstitious age and two of the most respectable of the latin fathers very honestly confess that the ignominious edict of valentinian was just and necessary and that the christian priests had deserved to lose a privilege which was still enjoyed by comedians charioteers and the ministers of idols but the wisdom and authority of the legislator are seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant dexterity of private interest and jerome or ambrose might patiently acquiesce in the justice of an ineffectual or salutary law if the ecclesiastics were checked in the pursuit of personal emolument they would exert a more laudable industry to increase the wealth of the church and dignify their covetousness with the specious names of piety and patriotism pudet dicere sacerdotes

his impartial sense in these expressive words the praefecture of juventius was accompanied with peace and plenty but the tranquillity of his government was soon disturbed by a bloody sedition of the distracted people the ardour of damasus and ursinus to seize the episcopal seat surpassed the ordinary measure of human ambition they contended with the rage of party the quarrel was maintained by the wounds and death of their followers and the prefect unable to resist or to appease the tumult was constrained by superior violence to retire into the suburbs damasus prevailed the welldisputed victory

conversion at such a price  this lively picture of the wealth and luxury of the popes in the fourth century becomes the more curious as it represents the intermediate degree between the humble poverty of the apostolic fisherman and the royal state of a temporal prince whose dominions extend from the confines of naples to the banks of the po  when the suffrage of the generals and of the foreign wars a d          army committed the scepter of the roman empire to the hands of valentinian his reputation in arms his military skill and experience and his rigid attachment to the forms as well as spirit of ancient discipline were the principal motives of their judicious choice the eagerness of the troops who pressed him to nominate his colleague was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs and valentinian himself was conscious that the abilities of the most active mind were unequal to the defense of the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy as soon as the death of julian had relieved the barbarians from the terror of his name the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the east of the north and of the south their inroads were often vexatious and sometimes a d          formidable but during the twelve years of the reign of valentinian his firmness and vigilance protected his own dominions and his powerful genius seemed to inspire and direct the feeble counsels of his brother perhaps the method of annals would more forcibly express the urgent and divided cares of the two emperors but the attention of the reader likewise would be distracted by a tedious and desultory narrative a separate view of the five great theaters of war i germany ii britain iii africa iv the east and v the danube will impress a more distinct image of the

the quantity of the presents to which they were entitled either from custom or treaty on the accession of a new emperor they expressed and they communicated to their countrymen their strong sense of the national affront the irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion of contempt and the martial youth crowded to their standard before valentinian could pass the alps the villages of gaul were in flames before his general dagalaiphus could encounter the alemanni they had secured the captives and the spoil in the forests of germany in the beginning a d     january of the ensuing year the military force of the whole nation in deep and solid columns broke through the barrier of the rhine during the severity of a northern winter two roman counts were defeated and mortally wounded and the standard of the heruli and batavians fell into the hands of the conquerors who displayed with insulting shouts and menaces the trophy of their victory the standard was recovered but the batavians had not redeemed the shame of their disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge it was the opinion of valentinian that his soldiers must learn to fear their commander before they could cease to fear the enemy the troops were solemnly assembled and the trembling batavians were enclosed within the circle of the imperial army valentinian then ascended his tribunal and as if he disdained to punish cowardice with death he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy on the officers whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to be the first occasion of the defeat the batavians were degraded from their rank stripped of their arms and condemned to be sold for slaves to the highest bidder at this tremendous sentence the troops fell prostrate on the ground deprecated the indignation of their sovereign and protested that if he would indulge them in another trial they would approve themselves not unworthy of the name of romans and of his soldiers valentinian with

slippery descent was obliged to leave behind him his armorbearer and his helmit magnificently enriched with gold and precious stones at the signal of the general assault the roman troops encompassed and ascended the mountain of solicinium on three different sides every step which they gained increased their ardour and abated the resistance of the enemy and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the hill they impetuously urged the barbarians down the northern descent where count sebastian was posted to intercept their retreat after this signal victory valentinian returned to his winter quarters at treves where he indulged the public joy by the exhibition of splendid and triumphal games the expedition of valentinian is related by ammianus xxvii  0 and celebrated by ausonius

promised but they were amused with excuses and delays till at length after a fruitless expectation they were compelled to retire the arms and fortifications of the gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment and their massacre of the captives served to embitter the hereditary feud of the burgundians and the alemanni the inconstancy of a wise prince may perhaps be explained by some alteration of circumstances and perhaps it was the original design of valentinian to intimidate rather than to destroy as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of

he fills the interval between the saxons and the cimbri with six obscure tribes who were united as early as the sixth century under the national appellation anes see cluver german antiq l iii c

has marked the extensive limits of the saxony of charlemagne  the solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners and loose constitution of the tribes of germany which were blended with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship the situation of the native saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen and pirates and the success of their first adventures would naturally excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen who were impatient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains every tide might float down the elbe whole fleets of canoes filled with hardy and intrepid associates who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds it should seem probable however that the most numerous auxiliaries of the saxons were furnished by the nations who dwelt along the shores of the baltic they possessed arms and ships the art of navigation and the habits of

pirates and adventurers who fought under the same standard were insensibly united in a permanent society at first of rapine and afterward of government a military confederation was gradually molded into a national body by the gentle operation of marriage and consanguinity and the adjacent tribes who solicited the alliance accepted the name and laws of the saxons if the fact were not established by the most unquestionable evidence we should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers by the description of the vessels in which the saxon pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the german ocean the british channel and the bay of biscay the keel of their large flatbottomed boats was framed of light timber but the sides and upper works consisted only of wicker with a covering of strong

vessels would now astonish the genius of caesar    in the course of their slow and distant navigations they must always have been exposed to the danger and very frequently to the misfortune of shipwreck and the naval annals of the saxons were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which they sustained on the coasts of britain and gaul but the daring spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the sea and of the shore their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprise the meanest of their mariners was alike capable of handling an oar of rearing a sail or of conducting a vessel and the saxons rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest which concealed their design and dispersed the fleets of the enemy the best original account of the saxon pirates may be found in

provinces of gaul were afflicted by the saxons a military count was stationed for the defense of the seacoast or armorican limit and that officer who found his strength or his abilities unequal to the task implored the assistance of severus mastergeneral of the infantry the saxons surrounded and outnumbered were forced to relinquish their spoil and to yield a select band of their tall and robust youth to serve in the imperial armies they stipulated only a safe and honorable retreat and the condition was readily granted by the roman general who meditated an act of perfidy ammian xxviii   justifies this breach of faith to pirates and robbers and orosius l vii c    more clearly expresses their real guilt virtute atque agilitate terribiles  imprudent as it was inhuman while a saxon

fortune the power and almost the memory of the picts have been extinguished by their successful rivals and the scots after maintaining for ages the dignity of an independent kingdom have multiplied by an equal and voluntary union the honors of the english name the hand of nature had contributed to mark the ancient distinction of the scots and picts the former were the men of the hills and the latter those of the plain the eastern coast of caledonia may be considered as a level and fertile country which even in a rude state of tillage was capable of producing a considerable quantity of corn and the epithet of cruitnich or wheateaters expressed the contempt or envy of the carnivorous highlander the cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate separation of property and the habits of a sedentary life but the love of arms and rapine was still the ruling passion of the picts and their warriors who stripped themselves for a day of battle were distinguished in the eyes of the romans by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies with gaudy colors and fantastic figures the western part of caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills which scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman and are most profitably used for the pasture of cattle the highlanders were condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters and as they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation they acquired the expressive name of scots which in the celtic tongue is said to be equivalent to that of wanderers or vagrants the inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the waters the deep lakes and bays which intersect their country are plentifully stored with fish and they gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean the vicinity of the hebrides so profusely scattered along the western coast of scotland tempted their curiosity and improved their skill and they acquired by slow degrees the art or rather the habit of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of the wellknown stars the two bold headlands of caledonia almost touch the shores of a spacious island which obtained from its luxuriant vegetation the epithet of green and has preserved with a slight alteration the name of erin or ierne or ireland it is probable that in some remote period of antiquity the fertile plains of ulster received a colony of hungry scots and that the strangers of the north who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions spread their conquests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary island it is certain that in the declining age of the roman empire caledonia ireland and the isle of man were inhabited by the scots and that the kindred tribes who were often associated in military enterprise were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes they long cherished the lively tradition of their common name and origin and the missionaries of the isle of saints who diffused the light of christianity over north britain established the vain opinion that their irish countrymen were the natural as well as spiritual fathers of the scottish race the loose and obscure tradition has been preserved by the venerable bede who scattered some rays of light over the darkness of the eighth century on this slight foundation an huge

with peculiar complacency by the writers of the age but his real merit deserved their applause and his nomination was received by the army and province as a sure presage of approaching victory he seized the favorable moment of navigation and securely landed the numerous and veteran bands of the heruli and batavians the jovians and the victors in his march from sandwich to london theodosius defeated several parties of the barbarians released a multitude of captives and after distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil established the fame of disinterested justice by the restitution of the remainder to the rightful proprietors the citizens of london who had almost despaired of their safety threw open their gates and as soon as theodosius had obtained from the court of treves the important aid of a military lieutenant and a civil governor he executed with wisdom and vigor the laborious task of the deliverance of britain the vagrant soldiers were recalled to their standard an edict of amnesty dispelled the public apprehensions and his cheerful example alleviated the rigor of martial discipline the scattered and desultory warfare of the barbarians who infested

accused as the author of the public calamity in the annual assembly of the three cities they nominated two deputies to lay at the feet of valentinian the customary offering of a gold victory and to accompany this tribute of duty rather than of gratitude with their humble complaint that they were ruined by the enemy and betrayed by their governor if the severity of valentinian had been rightly directed it would have fallen on the guilty head of romanus but the count long exercised in the arts of corruption had dispatched a swift and trusty messenger to secure the venal friendship of remigius master of the offices the wisdom of the imperial council was deceived by artifice and their honest indignation was cooled by delay at length when the repetition of complaint had been justified by the repetition of public misfortunes the notary palladius was sent from the court of treves to examine the state of africa and the conduct of romanus the rigid impartiality of palladius was easily disarmed he was tempted to reserve for himself a part of the public treasure which he brought with him for the payment of the troops and from the moment that he was conscious of his own guilt he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and merit of the count the charge of the tripolitans was declared to be false and frivolous and palladius himself was sent back from treves to

success that he compelled the citizens of leptis who had sustained a recent siege of eight days to contradict the truth of their own decrees and to censure the behavior of their own deputies a bloody sentence was pronounced without hesitation by the rash and headstrong cruelty of valentinian the president of tripoli who had presumed to pity the distress of the province was publicly executed at

deliverer of his country and as soon as it appeared that romanus was formidable only to a submissive province the tyrant of africa became the object of universal contempt the ruin of caesarea which was plundered and burnt by the licentious barbarians convinced the refractory cities of the danger of resistance the power of firmus was established at least in the provinces of mauritania and numidia and it seemed to be his only doubt whether he should assume the diadem of a moorish king or the purple of a roman emperor but the imprudent and unhappy africans soon discovered that in this rash insurrection they had not sufficiently consulted their own strength or the abilities of their leader before he could procure any certain intelligence that the emperor of the west had fixed the choice of a general or that a fleet of transports was collected at the mouth of the rhone he was suddenly informed that the great theodosius recovers africa a d     theodosius with a small band of veterans had landed near igilgilis or gigeri on the african coast and the timid usurper sunk under the ascendant of virtue and military genius though firmus possessed arms and treasures his despair of victory immediately reduced him to the use of those arts which in the same country and in a similar situation had formerly been practiced by the crafty jugurtha he attempted to deceive by an apparent submission the vigilance of the roman general to seduce the fidelity of his troops and to protract the duration of the war by successively engaging the independent tribes of africa to espouse his quarrel or to protect his flight theodosius imitated the example and obtained the success of his predecessor metellus when firmus in the character of a suppliant accused his own rashness and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor the lieutenant of valentinian received and dismissed him with a friendly embrace but he diligently required the useful and substantial pledges of a sincere repentance nor could he be persuaded by the assurances of peace to suspend for an instant the operations of an active war a dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of theodosius and he satisfied without much reluctance the public indignation which he had secretly excited several of the guilty accomplices of firmus were abandoned according to ancient custom to the tumult of a military execution many more by the amputation of both their hands continued to exhibit an instructive spectacle of horror the hatred of the rebels was accompanied with fear and the fear of the roman soldiers was mingled with respectful admiration amidst the boundless plains of getulia and the innumerable valleys of mount atlas it was impossible to prevent the escape of firmus and if the usurper could have tired the patience of his antagonist he would have secured his person in the depth of some remote solitude and expected the hopes of a future revolution he was subdued by the perseverance of theodosius who had formed an inflexible determination that the war should end only by the death of the tyrant and that every nation of africa which presumed to support his cause should be involved in his ruin at the head of a small body of troops which seldom exceeded three thousand five hundred men the roman general advanced with a steady prudence devoid of rashness or of fear into the heart of a country where he was sometimes attacked by armies of twenty thousand moors the boldness of his charge dismayed the irregular barbarians they were disconcerted by his seasonable and orderly retreats they were continually baffled by the unknown resources of the military art and they felt and confessed the just superiority which was assumed by the leader of a civilized nation when theodosius entered the extensive dominions of igmazen king of the isaflenses the haughty savage required in words of defiance his name and the object of his expedition i am replied the stern and

execute the fatal menace he consented to purchase a necessary peace by the sacrifice of a guilty fugitive the guards that were placed to secure the person of firmus deprived him of the hopes of escape and the moorish tyrant after wine had extinguished the sense of danger disappointed the insulting triumph of the romans by strangling himself in the night his dead body the only present which igmazen

formidable host of cuirassiers of archers and of mercenary foot but it was the invariable practice of sapor to mix war and negotiation and to consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments of regal policy he affected to praise the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of armenia and the unsuspicious tiranus was persuaded by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship to deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy in the midst of a splendid entertainment he was bound in chains of silver as an honor due to the blood of the arsacides and after a short confinement in the tower of oblivion at ecbatana he was released from the miseries of life either by his own dagger or by that of an assassin the kingdom of armenia was reduced to the state of a persian province the administration was shared between a distinguished satrap and a favorite eunuch and sapor marched without delay to subdue the martial spirit of the iberians sauromaces who reigned in that country by the permission of the emperors was expelled by a superior force and as an insult on the majesty of rome the king of kings placed a diadem on the head of his abject vassal aspacuras

danger of olympias the wife or widow of the armenian king excited the public compassion and animated the desperate valor of her subjects and soldiers the persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of artogerassa by a bold and wellconcerted sally of the besieged but the forces of sapor were continually renewed and increased the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted the strength of

two dependent kingdoms he soon felt that a country is unsubdued as long as the minds of the people are actuated by an hostile and contumacious spirit the satraps whom he was obliged to trust embraced the first opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen and of signalising their immortal hatred to the persian name since the conversion of the armenians and iberians those nations considered the christians as the favorites and the magians as the adversaries of the supreme being the influence of the clergy over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted in the cause of rome and as long as the successors of constantine disputed with those of artaxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediate provinces the religious connection always threw a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire a numerous and active party acknowledged para the son of tiranus as the lawful sovereign of armenia and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years by the unanimous consent of the iberians the country was equally divided between the rival princes and aspacuras who owed his diadem to the choice of sapor was obliged to declare that his regard for his children who were detained as hostages by the tyrant was the only consideration which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of persia the emperor valens who respected the obligations of the treaty and who was apprehensive of involving the east in a dangerous war ventured with slow and cautious measures to support the roman party in the kingdoms of iberia and armenia twelve legions established the authority of sauromaces on the banks of the cyrus the euphrates was protected by the valor of arintheus a powerful army under the command of count trajan and of vadomair king of the alemanni fixed their camp on the confines of armenia but they were strictly enjoined not to commit the first hostilities which might be understood as a breach of the treaty and such was the implicit obedience of the roman general that they retreated with exemplary patience under a shower of persian arrows till they had clearly acquired a just title to an honorable and legitimate victory yet these appearances of war insensibly subsided in a vain and tedious negotiation the contending parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition and it should seem that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms since they were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial testimony of the generals of the

form one of the most striking and singular objects the noble youth by the persuasion of his mother olympias had escaped through the persian host that besieged artogerassa and implored the protection of the emperor of the east by his timid councils para was alternately supported and recalled and restored and betrayed the hopes of the armenians were sometimes raised by the presence of their natural sovereign and the ministers of valens were satisfied that they preserved the integrity of the public says if their vassal was not suffered to assume the diadem and title of king but they soon repented of their own rashness they were confounded by the reproaches and threats of the persian monarch they found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant temper of para himself who sacrificed to the slightest suspicions the lives of his most faithful servants and held a secret and disgraceful correspondence with the assassin of his father and the enemy of his country under the specious pretense of consulting with the emperor on the subject of their common interest para was persuaded to descend from the mountains of armenia where his party was in arms and to trust his independence and safety to the discretion of a perfidious court the king of armenia for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those of his nation was received with due honors by the governors of the provinces through which he passed but when he arrived at tarsus in cilicia his progress was stopped under various pretenses his motions were watched with respectful vigilance and he gradually discovered that he was a prisoner in the hands of the romans para suppressed his indignation dissembled his fears and after secretly preparing his escape mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful followers the officer stationed at the door of his apartment immediately communicated his flight to the consular of cilicia who overtook him in the suburbs and endeavored without success to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design a legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive but the pursuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged into the air they retreated with precipitation to the gates of tarsus after an incessant march of two days and two nights para and his armenians reached the banks of the euphrates but the passage of the river which they were obliged to swim was attended with some delay and some loss the country was alarmed and the two roads which were only separated by an interval of three miles had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback under the command of a count and a tribune para must have yielded to superior force if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the means of escape a dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed the armenian troop through the thicket and para had left behind him the count and the tribune while they patiently expected his approach along the public highways they returned to the imperial court to excuse their want of diligence or success and seriously alleged that the king of armenia who was a skilful magician had transformed himself and his followers and passed before their eyes under a borrowed shape after his return to his native kingdom para still continued to profess himself the friend and ally of the romans but the romans had injured him too deeply ever to forgive and the secret sentence of his death was signed in the council of valens the execution of the bloody deed was committed to the subtle prudence of count trajan and he had the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of the credulous prince that he might find an opportunity of stabbing him to the heart para was invited to a roman banquet which had been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the east the hall resounded with cheerful music and the company was already heated with wine when the count retired for an instant drew his sword and gave the signal of the murder a robust and desperate barbarian instantly rushed on the king of armenia and though he bravely defended his life with the first weapon that chance offered to his hand the table of the imperial a d     general was stained with the royal blood of a guest and an ally such were the weak and wicked maxims of the roman

almost incredible difference that the martial spirit of the gothic hero instead of being supported by the vigor of youth was displayed with glory and success in the extreme period of human life between the age of fourscore and one hundred and ten years the independent tribes were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge the king of the ostrogoths as the sovereign of the gothic nation the chiefs of the visigoths or thervingi renounced the royal title and assumed the more humble appellation of judges and among those judges athanaric fritigern and alavivus were the most illustrious by their personal merit as well as by their vicinity to the roman provinces these domestic conquests which increased the military power of hermanric enlarged his ambitious designs he invaded the adjacent

strength and agility and the assistance of their light infantry was eagerly solicited and highly esteemed in all the wars of the barbarians but the active spirit of the heruli was subdued by the slow and steady perseverance of the goths and after a bloody action in which the king was slain the remains of that warlike tribe became an useful accession to the camp of hermanric he then marched against the venedi unskilled in the use of arms and formidable only by their numbers which filled the wide extent of the plains of modern poland the victorious goths who were not inferior in numbers prevailed in the contest by the decisive advantages of exercise and discipline after the submission of the venedi the conqueror advanced without resistance as far as the confines of the aestii the edition of

ancient people whose name is still preserved in the province of esthonia those distant inhabitants of the baltic coast were supported by the labors of agriculture enriched by the trade of amber and consecrated by the peculiar worship of the mother of the gods but the scarcity of iron obliged the aestian warriors to content themselves with wooden clubs and the reduction of that wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence rather than to the arms of hermanric his dominions which extended from the danube to the baltic included the native seats and the recent acquisitions of the goths and he reigned over the greatest part of germany and scythia with the authority of a conqueror and sometimes with the cruelty of a tyrant but he reigned over a part of the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the glory of its heroes the name of hermanric is almost buried in oblivion his exploits are imperfectly known and the romans themselves appeared unconscious of the progress of an aspiring power which threatened the liberty of the north and the peace of the empire ammianus xxxi   observes in general terms ermenrichi nobilissimi regis et per multa variaque fortiter facta vicinis gentibus

signal proofs they respected the public peace and if an hostile band sometimes presumed to pass the roman limit their irregular conduct was heartily ascribed to the ungovernable spirit of the barbarian youth their contempt for two new and obscure princes who had been raised to the throne by a popular election inspired the goths with bolder hopes and while they agitated some design of

the insolence of masters and the licentiousness of enemies but the intemperance which gratified their appetites retarded their progress and before the goths could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of procopius they perceived by the hostile state of the country that the civil and military powers were resumed by his successful rival a chain of posts and fortifications skilfully disposed by valens or the generals of valens resisted their march prevented their retreat and intercepted their subsistence the fierceness of the barbarians was tamed and suspended by hunger they indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror who offered them food and chains the numerous captives were distributed in all the cities of the east and the provincials who were soon familiarized with their savage appearance ventured by degrees to measure their own strength with these formidable adversaries whose name had so long been the object of their terror the king of scythia and hermanric alone could deserve so lofty a title was grieved and exasperated by this national calamity his ambassadors loudly complained at the court of valens of the infraction of the ancient and solemn alliance which had so long subsisted between the romans and the goths they alleged that they had fulfilled the duty of allies by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor julian they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives and they urged a very singular claim that the gothic generals marching in arms and in hostile array were entitled to the sacred

goths resigned to the brave athanaric the danger and glory of a defensive war against an enemy who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty state a bridge of boats was established upon the

of the cavalry and infantry the operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and experience but they found it impossible to drive the visigoths from their strong posts in the mountains and the devastation of the plains obliged the romans themselves to repass the danube on the approach of winter the incessant rains which swelled the waters of the river produced a tacit suspension of arms and confined the emperor valens during the whole course of the ensuing summer to his camp of marcianapolis the third year of the war was more savourable to the romans and more pernicious to the goths the interruption of trade deprived the barbarians of the objects of luxury which they already confounded with the necessaries of life and the desolation of a very extensive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of famine athanaric was provoked or compelled to risk a battle which he lost in the plains and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals who had promised a large reward for the head of every goth that was brought into the imperial camp the submission of the barbarians appeased the resentment of valens and his council the emperor listened with satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the senate of constantinople which assumed for the first time a share in the public deliberations and the same generals victor and arintheus who had successfully directed the conduct of the war were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace the freedom of trade which the goths had hitherto enjoyed was restricted to two cities on the danube the rashness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their pensions and subsidies and the exception which was stipulated in favor of athanaric alone was more advantageous than honorable to the judge of the visigoths athanaric who on this occasion appears to have consulted his private interest without expecting the orders of his sovereign supported his own dignity and that of his tribe in the personal interview which was proposed by the ministers of valens he persisted in his declaration that it was impossible for him without incurring the guilt of perjury ever to set his foot on the territory of the empire and it is more than probable that his regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of roman treachery the danube which separated the dominions of the two independent nations was chosen for the scene of the conference the emperor of the east and the judge of the visigoths accompanied by an equal number of armed followers advanced in their respective barges to the middle of the stream after the ratification of the treaty and the delivery of hostages valens returned in

valeria and the direction of the work were entrusted to the zeal of his son marcellinus the emperor should no longer be importuned with the audacious remonstrances of the barbarians the subjects of rome and the natives of germany were insulted by the arrogance of a young and worthless minister who considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his superior merit he affected however to

obtained the usual reinforcement of the cavalry of their sarmatian allies so improvident was the assassin marcellinus that he chose the moment when the bravest veterans had been drawn away to suppress the revolt of firmus and the whole province was exposed with a very feeble defense to the rage of the exasperated barbarians they invaded pannonia in the season of harvest unmercifully destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily transport and either disregarded or demolished the empty fortifications the princess constantia the daughter of the emperor constantius and the granddaughter of the great constantine very narrowly escaped that royal maid who had innocently supported the revolt of procopius was now the destined wife of the heir of the western empire she traversed the peaceful province with a splendid and unarmed train her person was saved from danger and the republic from disgrace by the active zeal of messala governor of the provinces as soon as he was informed that the village where she stopped only to dine was almost encompassed by the barbarians he hastily placed her in his own chariot and drove full speed till he reached the gates of sirmium which were at the distance of six and twenty miles even sirmium might not have been secure if the quadi and sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general consternation of the magistrates and people their delay allowed probus the praetorian prefect sufficient time to recover his own spirits and to revive the courage of the citizens he skilfully directed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the decayed fortifications and procured the seasonable and effectual assistance of a company of archers to protect the capital of the illyrian provinces disappointed in their attempts against the walls of sirmium the indignant barbarians turned their arms against the mastergeneral of the frontier to whom they unjustly attributed the murder of their king equitius could bring into the field no more than two legions but they contained the veteran strength of the maesian and pannonian bands the obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honors of rank and precedence was the cause of their destruction and while they acted with separate forces and divided councils they were surprised and slaughtered by the active vigor of the sarmatian horse the success of this invasion provoked the emulation of the bordering tribes and the province of maesia would infallibly have been lost if young theodosius the duke or military commander of the frontier had not signalised in the defeat of the public enemy an intrepid genius worthy of his illustrious father and of his future greatness ammianus xxix   and zosimus l iv p       0 carefully mark the origin and progress of the

of his designs till the ensuing spring he marched in person with a a d     considerable part of the forces of gaul from the banks of the moselle and to the suppliant ambassadors of the sarmatians who met him on the way he returned a doubtful answer that as soon as he reached the scene of action he should examine and pronounce when he arrived at sirmium he gave audience to the deputies of the illyrian provinces who loudly congratulated their own felicity under the auspicious government of probus his praetorian prefect ammianus xxx   who acknowledges the merit has censured with becoming asperity the oppressive administration of petronius probus when jerome translated and continued the chronicle of eusebius a d   0 see tillemont mem eccles tom xii p        he expressed the truth or at

freely sent by the wishes of the province with tears and groans am i sent replied iphicles by a reluctant people the emperor paused but the impunity of his ministers established the pernicious maxim that they might oppress his subjects without injuring his service a strict inquiry into their conduct would have relieved the public discontent the severe condemnation of the murder of gabinius was the only measure which could restore the confidence of the germans and vindicate the honor of the roman name but the haughty monarch was incapable of the magnanimity which dares to acknowledge a fault he forgot the provocation remembered only the injury and advanced into the country of the quadi with an insatiate thirst of blood and revenge the extreme devastation and promiscuous massacre of a savage war were justified in the eyes of the emperor and perhaps in those of the world by the cruel equity of retaliation ammian xxx   jerome who exaggerates the misfortune of valentinian refuses him even this last consolation of revenge genitali vastato solo et inuitam patriam derelinquens tom i p     and such was the discipline of the romans and the consternation of the enemy that valentinian repassed the danube without the loss of a single man as he had resolved to complete the destruction of the quadi by a second campaign he fixed his winter quarters at bregetio on the danube near the hungarian city of presburgh while the operations of war were suspended by the severity of the weather the quadi made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror and at the earnest persuasion of equitius their ambassadors were introduced into the imperial council they approached the throne with bended bodies and dejected countenances and without daring to complain of the murder of their king they affirmed with solemn oaths that the late invasion was the crime of some irregular robbers which the public council of the nation condemned and abhorred the answer of the emperor left them but little to hope from his clemency or compassion he reviled in the most intemperate language their baseness their ingratitude their insolence  his eyes his voice his color his gestures expressed the violence of his ungoverned fury and while his whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion a large bloodvessel suddenly burst in his body and valentinian fell speechless into the arms of his attendants their pious care immediately concealed his situation from the crowd but in a few minutes the emperor of the west expired in an agony of pain and death of valentinian retaining his senses till the last and struggling without success to declare his intentions to the generals and ministers who surrounded the royal couch valentinian was about fiftyfour years of a d     nov   th

admiration of those naked charms which she had often seen in the bath was expressed with such lavish and imprudent praise that the emperor was tempted to introduce a second wife into his bed and his public edict extended to all the subjects of the empire the same domestic privilege which he had assumed for himself but we may be assured from the evidence of reason as well as history that the two marriages of valentinian with severa and with justina were successively contracted and that he used the ancient permission of divorce which was still allowed by the laws though it was condemned by the church severa was the mother of gratian who seemed to unite every claim which could entitle him to the undoubted succession of the western empire he was the eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had confirmed the free and honorable choice of his fellow soldiers before he had attained the ninth year of his age the royal youth received from the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem with the title of augustus the election was solemnly ratified by the consent and applause of the armies of gaul ammianus xxvii   describes the form of this military election and august investiture valentinian does not appear to have consulted or even informed the senate of rome  and the name of gratian was added to the names of valentinian and valens in all the legal transactions of the roman government by his marriage with the granddaughter of constantine the son of valentinian acquired all the hereditary rights of the flavian family which in a series of three imperial generations were sanctified by time religion and the reverence of the people at the death of his father the royal youth was in the seventeenth year of his age and his virtues already justified the favorable opinion of the army and people but gratian resided without apprehension in the palace of treves whilst at the distance of many hundred miles valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of bregetio the passions which had been so long suppressed by the presence of a master immediately revived in the imperial council and the ambitious design of reigning in the name of an infant was artfully executed by mellobaudes and equitius who commanded the attachment of the illyrian and italian bands they contrived the most honorable pretenses to remove the popular leaders and the troops of gaul who might have asserted the claims of the lawful successor they suggested the necessity of extinguishing the hopes of foreign and domestic enemies by a bold and decisive measure the empress justina who had been left in a palace about one hundred miles from bregetio was respectfully invited to appear in the camp with the son of the deceased emperor on the sixth day after the death of valentinian the infant prince of the same name who was only four years old was shown in the arms of his mother to the legions and solemnly invested by military acclamation with the titles and ensigns of supreme power the impending dangers of a civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise and moderate conduct of the emperor gratian he cheerfully accepted the choice of the army declared that he should always consider the son of justina as a brother not as a rival and advised the empress with her son valentinian to fix their residence at milan in the fair and peaceful province of italy while he assumed the more arduous command of the countries beyond the alps gratian dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish or disgrace the authors of the conspiracy and though he uniformly behaved with tenderness and regard to his infant colleague he gradually confounded in the administration of the western empire the office of a guardian with the authority of a sovereign the government of the roman world was exercised in the united names of valens and his two nephews but the feeble emperor of the east who succeeded to the rank of his elder brother never obtained any weight or

greece and of egypt large boats were transported and lodged on the roofs of houses or at the distance of two miles from the shore the people with their habitations were swept away by the waters and

to the color of their respective prejudices that the establishment of heresy tended to produce an earthquake or that a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the progress of sin and error without presuming to discuss the truth or propriety of these lofty speculations the historian may content himself with an observation which seems to be justified by experience that man has much more to fear from the passions of his fellow creatures than from the convulsions of the elements dicaearchus the peripatetic composed a formal treatise to prove this obvious truth which is not the most honorable to the human species cicero de officiis ii    the mischievous effects of an earthquake or deluge a hurricane or the eruption of a volcano bear a very inconsiderable proportion to the ordinary calamities of war as they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of europe who amuse their own leisure and exercise the courage of their subjects in the practice of the military art but the laws and manners of modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier and the peaceful citizen had seldom reason to complain that his life or even his fortune is exposed to the rage of war in the disastrous period of the fall of the roman empire which may justly be dated from the reign of valens the happiness and security of each individual were personally attacked and the arts and labors of ages were rudely defaced by the barbarians of scythia and germany the invasion of the the huns and goths a d     huns precipitated on the provinces of the west the

in speaking of all or any of the northern shepherds of europe or asia i indifferently use the appellations of scythians or tartars  will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive emigrations  the different characters that mark the civilized the pastoral manners of the scythians or tartars nations of the globe may be ascribed to the use and the abuse of reason which so variously shapes and so artificially composes the manners and opinions of an european or a chinese but the operation of instinct is more sure and simple than that of reason it is much easier to ascertain the appetites of a quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher and the savage tribes of mankind as they approach nearer to the condition of animals preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other the uniform stability of their manners is the natural consequence of the imperfection of their faculties reduced to a similar situation their wants their desires their enjoyments still continue the same and the influence of food or climate which in a more improved state of society is suspended or subdued by so many moral causes most powerfully contributes to form and to maintain the national character of barbarians in every age the immense plains of scythia or tartary have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds whose indolence refuses to cultivate the earth and whose restless spirit disdains the confinement of a sedentary life in every age the scythians and tartars have been renowned for their invincible courage and rapid conquests the thrones of asia have been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the north and their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most fertile and warlike countries of europe imperium asiae ter quaesivere ipsi perpetuo

conquests often over the trembling nations from afar has scythia breathed the living cloud of war   on this occasion as well as on many others the sober historian is forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision and is compelled with some reluctance to confess that the pastoral manners which have been adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life to illustrate this observation i shall now proceed to consider a nation of shepherds and of warriors in the three important articles of i their diet ii their habitation and iii their exercises the narratives of antiquity are justified by the experience of modern times the fourth book of herodotus affords a curious though imperfect portrait of the scythians among the moderns who describe the uniform scene the khan of khowaresm abulghazi bahadur expresses his native feelings and his genealogical history of the tatars has been copiously illustrated by the french and

the mohammedan religion and   by the possession of the cities and harvests of the great bucharia   i the corn or even the rice which constitutes diet the ordinary and wholesome food of a civilized people can be obtained only by the patient toil of the husbandman some of the happy savages who dwell between the tropics are plentifully nourished by the liberality of nature but in the climates of the north a nation of shepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds the skilful practitioners of the medical art will determine if they are able to determine how far the temper of the human mind may be affected by the use of animal or of vegetable food and whether the common association of carnivorous and cruel deserves to be considered in any other light than that of an innocent perhaps a salutary prejudice of humanity il est certain que les grands mangeurs de viande sont en general cruels et feroces plus que les autres hommes cette observation est de touts les lieux et de touts les tems la barbare angloise est connue etc emile de rousseau tom i p     whatever we may think of the general observation we shall not easily allow the truth of his example the goodnatured complaints of plutarch and the pathetic lamentations of ovid seduce our reason by exciting our sensibility  yet if it be true that the sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the sight and practice of domestic cruelty we may observe that the horrid objects which are disguised by the arts of european refinement are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in the tent of a tartarian shepherd the ox or the sheep are slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food and the bleeding limbs are served with very little preparation on the table of their unfeeling murderer in the military profession and especially in the conduct of a numerous army the exclusive use of animal food appears to be productive of the most solid advantages corn is a bulky and perishable commodity and the large magazines which are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops must be slowly transported by the labor of men or horses but the flocks and herds which accompany the march of the tartars afford a sure and increasing supply of flesh and milk in the far greater part of the uncultivated waste the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant and there are few places so extremely barren that the hardy cattle of the north cannot find some tolerable pasture the supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite and patient abstinence of the tartars they indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table or have died of disease horseflesh which in every age and country has been proscribed by the civilized nations of europe and asia they devour with peculiar greediness and this singular taste facilitates the success of their military operations the active cavalry of scythia is always followed in their most distant and rapid incursions by an adequate number of spare horses who may be occasionally used either to redouble the speed or to satisfy the hunger of the barbarians many are the resources of courage and poverty when the forage round a camp of tartars is almost consumed they slaughter the greatest part of their cattle and preserve the flesh either smoked or dried in the sun on the sudden emergency of a hasty march they provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls of cheese or rather of hard curd which they occasionally dissolve in water and this unsubstantial diet will support for many days the life and even the spirits of the patient warrior but this extraordinary abstinence which the stoic would approve and the hermit might envy is commonly succeeded by the most voracious indulgence of appetite the wines of a happier climate are the most grateful present or the most valuable commodity that can be offered to the tartars and the only example of their industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mares milk a fermented liquor which possesses a very strong power of intoxication like the animals of prey the savages both of the old and new world experience the alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty and their stomach is inured to sustain without much inconvenience the opposite extremes of hunger and of intemperance  ii in the ages of rustic and martial simplicity habitations a people of soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and cultivated country and some time must elapse before the warlike youth of greece or italy could be assembled under the same standard either to defend their own confines or to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes the progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a large multitude within the walls of a city but these citizens are no longer soldiers and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil society corrupt the habits of the military life the pastoral manners of the scythians seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity and refinement the individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled but they are assembled in a camp and the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation the houses of the tartars are no more than small tents of an oval form which afford a cold and dirty habitation for the promiscuous youth of both sexes the palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts of such a size that they may be conveniently fixed on large wagons and drawn by a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen the flocks and herds after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures retire on the approach of night within the protection of the camp the necessity of preventing the most mischievous confusion in such a perpetual concourse of men and animals must gradually introduce in the distribution the order and the guard of the encampment the rudiments of the military art as soon as the forage of a certain district is consumed the tribe or rather army of shepherds makes a regular march to some fresh pastures and thus acquires in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral lise the practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult operations of war the choice of stations is regulated by the difference of the seasons in the summer the tartars advance toward the north and pitch their tents on the banks of a river or at least in the neighborhood of a running stream but in the winter they return to the south and shelter their camp behind some convenient eminence against the winds which are chilled in their passage over the bleak and icy regions of siberia these manners are admirably adapted to diffuse among the wandering tribes the spirit of emigration and conquest the connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a texture that it may be broken by the slightest accident the camp and not the soil is the native country of the genuine tartar within the precincts of that camp his family his companions his property are always included and in the most distant marches he is still surrounded by the objects which are dear or valuable or familiar in his eyes the thirst of rapine the fear or the resentment of injury the impatience of servitude have in every age been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of scythia boldly to advance into some unknown countries where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence or a less formidable enemy the revolutions of the north have frequently determined the fate of the south and in the conflict of hostile nations the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove and been driven from the confines of china to those of germany these tartar emigrations have been discovered by m de guignes histoire des huns tom i ii a skilful and laborious interpreter of the chinese language who has thus laid open new and important scenes in the history of mankind  these great emigrations which have been sometimes executed with almost incredible diligence were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the climate it is well known that the cold of tartary is much more severe than in the midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected this uncommon rigor is attributed to the height of the plains which rise especially toward the east more than half a mile above the level of the sea and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is deeply impregnated a plain in the chinese tartary only eighty leagues from the great wall was found by the missionaries to be three thousand geometrical paces above the level of the sea montesquieu who has used and abused the relations of travelers deduces the revolutions of asia from this important circumstance that heat and cold weakness and strength touch each other without any temperate zone esprit des loix l xvii c    in the winterseason the broad and rapid rivers that discharge their waters into the euxine the caspian or the icy sea are strongly frozen the fields are covered with a bed of snow and the fugitive or victorious tribes may securely traverse with their families their wagons and their cattle the smooth and hard surface of an immense plain  iii the pastoral life compared with the labors exercises of agriculture and manufactures is undoubtedly a life of idleness and as the most honorable shepherds of the tartar race devolve on their captives the domestic management of the cattle their own leisure is seldom disturbed by any servile and assiduous cares but this leisure instead of being devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony is usefully spent in the violent and sanguinary exercise of the chase the plains of tartary are filled with a strong and serviceable breed of horses which are easily trained for the purposes of war and hunting the scythians of every age have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders and constant practice had seated them so firmly on horseback that they were supposed by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil life to eat to drink and even to sleep without dismounting from their steeds they excel in the dexterous management of the lance the long tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm and the weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and irresistible force these arrows are often pointed against the harmless animals of the desert which increase and multiply in the absence of their most formidable enemy the hare the goat the roebuck the fallowdeer the stag the elk and the antelope the vigor and patience both of the men and horses are continually exercised by the fatigues of the chase and the plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence and even luxury of a tartar camp but the exploits of the hunters of scythia are not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious beasts they boldly encounter the angry wildboar when he turns against his pursuers excite the sluggish courage of the bear and provoke the fury of the tiger as he slumbers in the thicket where there is danger there may be glory and the mode of hunting which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valor may justly be considered as the image and as the school of war the general huntingmatches the pride and delight of the tartar princes compose an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry a circle is drawn of many miles in circumference to encompass the game of an extensive district and the troops that form the circle regularly advance toward a common center where the captive animals surrounded on every side are abandoned to the darts of the hunters in this march which frequently continues many days the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills to swim the rivers and to wind through the valleys without interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress they acquire the habit of directing their eye and their steps to a remote object of preserving their intervals of suspending or accelerating their pace according to the motions of the troops on their right and left and of watching and repeating the signals of their leaders their leaders study in this practical school the most important lesson of the military art the prompt and accurate judgment of ground of distance and of time to employ against a human enemy the same patience and valor the same skill and discipline is the only alteration which is required in real war and the amusements of the chase serve as a prelude to the conquest of an empire petit de la croix

had often enjoyed as a sportsman   the political society of the ancient germans government has the appearance of a voluntary alliance of independent warriors the tribes of scythia distinguished by the modern appellation of hords assume the form of a numerous and increasing family which in the course of successive generations has been propagated from the same original stock the meanest and most ignorant of the tartars preserve with conscious pride the inestimable treasure of their genealogy and whatever distinctions of rank may have been introduced by the unequal distribution of pastoral wealth they mutually respect themselves and each other as the descendants of the first founder of the tribe the custom which still prevails of adopting the bravest and most faithful of the captives may countenance the very probable suspicion that this extensive consanguinity is in a great measure legal and fictitious but the useful prejudice which has obtained the sanction of time and opinion produces the effects of truth the haughty barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood and their chief or mursa as the representative of their great father exercises the authority of a judge in peace and of a leader in war in the original state of the pastoral world each of the mursas if we may continue to use a modern appellation acted as the independent chief of a large and separate family and the limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed by superior force or mutual consent but the constant operation of various and permanent causes contributed to unite the vagrant hords into national communities under the command of a supreme head the weak were desirous of support and the strong were ambitious of dominion the power which is the result of union oppressed and collected the divided forces of the adjacent tribes and as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the advantages of victory the most valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their followers under the formidable standard of a confederate nation the most successful of the tartar princes assumed the military command to which he was entitled by the superiority either of merit or of power he was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals and the title of khan expresses in the language of the north of asia the full extent of the regal dignity the right of hereditary succession was long confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy and at this moment all the khans who reign from crimea to the wall of china are the lineal descendants of the renowned zingis see the second volume of the genealogical history of the tartars and the lists of the khans at the end of the life of gengis or zingis under the reign of timur or tamerlane one of

by his age and valor is entrusted with the sword and scepter of his predecessor two distinct and regular taxes are levied on the tribes to support the dignity of their national monarch and of their peculiar chief and each of those contributions amounts to the tithe both of their property and of their spoil a tartar sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people and as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much larger proportion he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic splendour of his court to reward the most deserving or the most favored of his followers and to obtain from the gentle influence of corruption the obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern mandates of authority the manners of his subjects accustomed like himself to blood and rapine might excuse in their eyes such partial acts of tyranny as would excite the horror of a civilized people but the power of a despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of scythia the immediate jurisdiction of the khan is confined within the limits of his own tribe and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated by the ancient institution of a national council the coroultai see the diets of the ancient huns de guignes tom ii p    and a curious description of those of zingis vie de gengiscan l i c   l iv c    such assemblies are frequently mentioned

the princes of the reigning family and the mursas of the respective tribes may conveniently assemble on horseback with their martial and numerous trains and the ambitious monarch who reviewed the strength must consult the inclination of an armed people the rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered in the constitution of the scythian or tartar nations but the perpetual conflict of

exposed to intolerable hardships and of one hundred and forty thousand soldiers who marched against the barbarians thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their master these losses however were compensated by splendid and decisive success the chinese generals improved the superiority which they derived from the temper of their arms their chariots of war and the service of their

succession of the tanjous and while each hord was governed by its peculiar mursa their tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation as late as the thirteenth century their transient residence on the eastern banks of the volga was attested by the name of great hungary in the thirteenth century the monk rubruquis who traversed the immense plain of kipzak in his journey to

among their vassals toward the north they penetrated into the frozen regions of siberia among the savages who were accustomed in their rage or hunger to the taste of human flesh and their southern inroads were pushed as far as the confines of persia and india the mixture of sarmatic and german blood had contributed to improve the features of the alani to whiten their swarthy complexions and to tinge their hair with a yellowish cast which is seldom found in the tartar race they were less deformed in their persons less brutish in their manners than the huns but they did not yield to those formidable barbarians in their martial and independent spirit in the love of freedom which rejected even the use of domestic slaves and in the love of arms which considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind a naked scymetar fixed in the ground was the only object of their religious worship the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses and they viewed with pity and contempt the pusillanimous warriors who patiently expected the infirmities of age and the tortures of lingering disease utque hominibus quietis et placidis otium est voluptabile

belief of the arian theology and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of the innocent and the guilty but the attention of the emperor was most seriously engaged by the important intelligence which he received from the civil and military officers who were entrusted with the defense of the danube he was informed that the north was agitated by a furious tempest that the irruption of the huns an unknown and monstrous race of savages had subverted the power of the goths and that the suppliant multitudes of that warlike nation whose pride was now humbled in the dust covered a space of many miles along the banks of the river with outstretched arms and pathetic lamentations they loudly deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger acknowledged that their only hope of safety was in the clemency of the roman government and most solemnly protested that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of thrace they should ever hold themselves bound by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude to obey the laws and to guard the limits of the republic these assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the goths who impatiently expected from the mouth of valens an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen the emperor of the east was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder brother whose death happened a d     nov    toward the end of the preceding year and as the distressful situation of the goths required an instant and peremptory decision he was deprived of the favorite resource of feeble and timid minds who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence as long as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind the questions of war and peace of justice and policy which were debated in the councils of antiquity will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern deliberation but the most experienced statesman of europe has never been summoned to consider the propriety or the danger of admitting or rejecting an innumerable multitude of barbarians who are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a civilized nation when that important proposition so essentially connected with the public safety was referred to the ministers of valens they were perplexed and divided but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favorable to the pride the indolence and the avarice of their sovereign the slaves who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals dissembled or disregarded the terrors of this national emigration so extremely different from the partial and accidental colonies which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire but they applauded the liberality of fortune which had conducted from the most distant countries of the globe a numerous and invincible army of strangers to defend the throne of valens who might now add to the royal treasures the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual proportion of recruits the prayers of the goths were granted and their service was accepted by the imperial court and orders were immediately dispatched to the civil and military governors of the thracian diocese to make the necessary preparations for the passage and subsistence of a great people till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted for their future residence the liberality of the emperor was accompanied however with two harsh and rigorous conditions which prudence might justify on the side of the romans but which distress alone could extort from the indignant goths before they passed the danube they were required to deliver their arms and it was insisted that their children should be taken from them and dispersed through the provinces of asia where they might be civilized by the arts of education and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents  during this suspense of a doubtful and distant they are transported over the danube into the roman empire negotiation the impatient goths made some rash attempts to pass the danube without the permission of the government whose protection they had implored their motions were strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were stationed along the river and their foremost detachments were defeated with considerable slaughter yet such were the timid councils of the reign of valens that the brave officers who had served their country in the execution of their duty were punished by the loss of their employments and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads the imperial mandate was at length received for transporting over the danube the whole body of the gothic nation the passage of the danube is exposed by ammianus xxxi     zosimus l iv p         eunapius in excerpt legate p     0 and jornandes c

incessant rains and in this tumultuous passage many were swept away and drowned by the rapid violence of the current a large fleet of vessels of boats and of canoes was provided many days and nights they passed and repassed with indefatigable toil and the most strenuous diligence was exerted by the officers of valens that not a single barbarian of those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of rome should be left on the opposite shore it was thought expedient that an accurate account should be taken of their numbers but the persons who were employed soon desisted with amazement and dismay from the prosecution of the endless and impracticable task quem si scire velit libyci velit aequoris idem scire quam multae zephyro truduntur harenae ammianus has inserted in his

of the age most seriously affirms that the prodigious armies of darius and xerxes which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous antiquity were now justified in the eyes of mankind by the evidence of fact and experience a probable testimony has fixed the number of the gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women of children and of slaves the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration must have amounted to near a million of persons of both sexes and of all ages the children of the goths those at least of a distinguished rank were separated from the multitude they were conducted without delay to the distant seats assigned for their residence and education and as the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the cities their gay and splendid apparel their robust and martial figure excited the surprise and envy of the provincials but the stipulation the most offensive to the goths and the most important to the romans was shamefully eluded the barbarians who considered their arms as the ensigns of honor and the pledges of safety were disposed to offer a price which the lust or avarice of the imperial officers was easily tempted to accept to preserve their arms the haughty warriors consented with some reluctance to prostitute their wives or their daughters the charms of a beauteous maid or a comely boy secured the connivance of the inspectors who sometimes cast an eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies eunapius and zosimus curiously specify these articles of gothic wealth and luxury yet it must be presumed that they were the manufactures of the provinces which the barbarians had acquired as the spoils of war or as the gifts or merchandise of peace  or who sacrificed their duty to the mean consideration of filling their farms with cattle and their houses with slaves the goths with arms in their hands were permitted to enter the boats and when their strength was collected on the other side of the river the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills of the lower maesia assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect the leaders of the ostrogoths alatheus and saphrax the guardians of their infant king appeared soon afterward on the northern banks of the danube and immediately dispatched their ambassadors to the court of antioch to solicit with the same professions of allegiance and gratitude the same favor which had been granted to the suppliant visigoths the absolute refusal of valens suspended their progress and discovered the repentance the suspicions and the fears of the imperial council  an undisciplined and unsettled nation of barbarians their distress and discontent required the firmest temper and the most dexterous management the daily subsistence of near a million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant and skilful diligence and might continually be interrupted by mistake or accident the insolence or the indignation of the goths if they conceived themselves to be the objects either of fear or of contempt might urge them to the most desperate extremities and the fortune of the state seemed to depend on the prudence as well as the integrity of the generals of valens at this important crisis the military government of thrace was exercised by lupicinus and maximus in whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every consideration of public advantage and whose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash and criminal administration instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign and satisfying with decent liberality the demands of the goths they levied an ungenerous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry barbarians the vilest food was sold at an extravagant price and in the room of wholesome and substantial provisions the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs and of unclean animals who had died of disease to obtain the valuable acquisition of a pound of bread the goths resigned the possession of an expensive though serviceable slave and a small quantity of meat was greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious but useless metal december libras the word silver must be understood jornandes betrays the

continued this necessary traffic by the sale of their sons and daughters and notwithstanding the love of freedom which animated every gothic breast they submitted to the humiliating maxim that it was better for their children to be maintained in a servile condition than to perish in a state of wretched and helpless independence the most lively resentment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors who sternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by subsequent injuries a spirit of discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the barbarians who pleaded without success the merit of their patient and dutiful behavior and loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received from their new allies they beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province in the midst of which they suffered the intolerable hardships of artificial famine but the means of relief and even of revenge were in their hands since the rapaciousness of their tyrants had left to an injured people the possession and the use of arms the clamours of a multitude untaught to disguise their sentiments announced the first symptoms of resistance and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of lupicinus and maximus those crafty ministers who substituted the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary counsels of general policy attempted to remove the goths from their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire and to disperse them in separate quarters of cantonment through the interior provinces as they were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect or confidence of the barbarians they diligently collected from every side a military force that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people who had not yet renounced the title or the duties of roman subjects but the generals of valens while their attention was solely directed to the discontented visigoths imprudently disarmed the ships and the fortifications which constituted the defense of the danube the fatal oversight was observed and improved by alatheus and saphrax who anxiously watched the favorable moment of escaping from the pursuit of the huns by the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily procured the leaders of the ostrogoths transported without opposition their king and their army and boldly fixed an hostile and independent camp on the territories of the empire ammianus xxxi       under the name of judges alavivus and fritigern revolt of the goths in maesia and their first victories were the leaders of the visigoths in peace and

as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and oppression the superior abilities of fritigern assumed the military command which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare he restrained the impatient spirit of the visigoths till the injuries and the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of mankind but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation sensible of the benefits which would result from the union of the gothic powers under the same standard he secretly cultivated the friendship of the ostrogoths and while he professed an implicit obedience to the orders of the roman generals he proceeded by slow marches toward marcianopolis the capital of the lower maesia about seventy miles from the banks of the danube on that fatal spot the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration lupicinus had invited the gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace but the gates of the city were strictly guarded and the barbarians were sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market to which they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies their humble prayers were rejected with insolence and derision and as their patience was now exhausted the townsmen the soldiers and the goths were soon involved in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches a blow was imprudently given a sword was hastily drawn and the first blood that was spilt in this accidental quarrel became the signal of a long and destructive war in the midst of noise and brutal intemperance lupicinus was informed by a secret messenger that many of his soldiers were slain and despoiled of their arms and as he was already inflamed by wine and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash command that their death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of fritigern and alavivus the clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised fritigern of his extreme danger and as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had so deeply injured him a trifling dispute said the gothic leader with a firm but gentle tone of voice appears to have arisen between the two nations but it may be productive of the most dangerous consequences unless the tumult is immediately pacified by the assurance of our safety and the authority of our presence at these words fritigern and his companions drew their swords opened their passage through the unresisting crowd which filled the palace the streets and the gates of marcianopolis and mounting their horses hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished romans the generals of the goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp war was instantly resolved and the resolution was executed without delay the banners of the nation were displayed

of such a military force as could be collected on this sudden emergency the barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from marcianopolis and on this occasion the talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops the valor of the goths was so ably directed by the genius of fritigern that they broke by a close and vigorous attack the ranks of the roman legions lupicinus left his arms and standards his tribunes and his bravest soldiers on the field of battle and their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious flight of their leader that successful day put an end to the distress of the barbarians and the security of the romans from that day the goths renouncing the precarious condition of strangers and exiles assumed the character of citizens and masters claimed an absolute dominion over the possessors of land and held in their own right the northern provinces of the empire which are bounded by the danube such are the words of the gothic historian jornandes de rebus geticis c    p     edit grot these splendidi panni they are comparatively such are undoubtedly transcribed from the larger histories of priscus ablavius or cassiodorius  who celebrates with rude eloquence the glory of his countrymen but the dominion of the barbarians was exercised only for the purposes of rapine

empire and the crimes of lupicinus were expiated they penetrate into thrace by the ruin of the peaceful husbandmen of thrace the conflagration of their villages and the massacre or captivity of their innocent families the report of the gothic victory was soon diffused over the adjacent country and while it filled the minds of the romans with terror and dismay their own hasty imprudence contributed to increase the forces of fritigern and the calamities of the province some time before the great emigration a numerous body of goths under the command of suerid and colias had been received into the protection and service of the empire cum populis suis long ante suscepti we are ignorant of the precise date and circumstances of their transmigration  they were encamped under the walls of hadrianople but the ministers of valens were anxious to remove them beyond the hellespont at a distance from the dangerous temptation which might so easily be communicated by the neighborhood and the success of their countrymen the respectful submission with which they yielded to the order of their march might be considered as a proof of their fidelity and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of provisions and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the most dutiful terms but the first magistrate of hadrianople incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his country house refused this indulgence and arming against them the inhabitants and manufacturers of a populous city he urged with hostile threats their instant departure the barbarians stood silent and amazed till they were exasperated by the insulting clamours and missile weapons of the populace but when patience or contempt was fatigued they crushed the undisciplined multitude inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies and despoiled them of the splendid armor an imperial manufacture of shields etc was established at hadrianople and the populace were headed by the fabricenses or workmen vales ad ammian xxxi    which they were unworthy to bear the resemblance of their sufferings and their actions soon united this victorious detachment to the nation of the visigoths the troops of colias and suerid expected the approach of the great fritigern ranged themselves under his standard and signalised their ardour in the siege of hadrianople but the resistance of the garrison informed the barbarians that in the attack of regular fortifications the efforts of unskilful courage are seldom effectual their general acknowledged his error raised the siege declared that he was at peace with stone walls pacem sibi esse cum parietibus memorans ammian xxxi    and revenged his disappointment on the adjacent country he accepted with pleasure the useful

submission of helpless innocence seldom found mercy from the barbarian conqueror in the course of these depredations a great number of the children of the goths who had been sold into captivity were restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents but these tender interviews which might have revived and cherished in their minds some sentiments of humanity tended only to stimulate their native fierceness by the desire of revenge they listened with eager attention to the complaints of their captive children who had suffered the most cruel indignities from the lustful or angry passions of their masters and the same cruelties the same indignities were severely retaliated on the sons and daughters of the romans see ammianus xxxi     the historian of the gothic war loses time and space by

nation of enemies but the visigoths might even yet have been reconciled by the manly confession of past errors and the sincere performance of former engagements these healing and temperate measures seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of the east but on this occasion alone valens was brave and his unseasonable bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects he declared his intention of marching from antioch to constantinople to subdue this dangerous rebellion and as he was not ignorant of the difficulties of the enterprise he solicited the assistance of his nephew the emperor gratian who commanded all the forces of the west the veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defense of armenia that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of sapor and the immediate conduct of the gothic war was entrusted during the absence of valens to his lieutenants trajan and profuturus two generals who indulged themselves in a very false and favorable

signal of their leader the camp was filled with the martial crowd of barbarians their impatient clamours demanded the battle and their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs the evening was already far advanced and the two armies prepared themselves for the approaching combat which was deferred only till the dawn of day while the trumpets sounded to arms the undaunted courage of the goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath and as they advanced to meet the enemy the rude songs which celebrated the glory of their forefathers were mingled with their fierce and dissonant outcries and opposed to the artificial harmony of the roman shout some military skill was displayed by fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding eminence but the bloody conflict which began and ended with the light was maintained on either side by the personal and obstinate efforts of strength valor and agility the legions of armenia supported their fame in arms but they were oppressed by the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of the romans was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed with their mangled carcasses this partial defeat was balanced however by partial success and when the two armies at a late hour of the evening retreated to their respective camps neither of them could claim the honors or the effects of a decisive victory the real loss was more severely felt by the romans in proportion to the smallness of their numbers but the goths were so deeply confounded and dismayed by this vigorous and perhaps unexpected resistance that they remained seven days within the circle of their fortifications such funeral rites as the circumstances of time and place would admit were piously discharged to some officers of distinguished rank but the indiscriminate vulgar was left unburied on the plain their flesh was greedily devoured by the birds of prey who in that age enjoyed very frequent and

  the progress of the goths had been checked union of the goths with the huns alani etc by the doubtful event of that bloody day and the imperial generals whose army would have been consumed by the repetition of such a contest embraced the more rational plan of destroying the barbarians by the wants and pressure of their own multitudes they prepared to confine the visigoths in the narrow angle of land between the danube the desert of scythia and the mountains of haemus till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by the inevitable operation of famine the design was prosecuted with some conduct and success the barbarians had almost exhausted their own magazines and the harvests of the country and the diligence of saturninus the mastergeneral of the cavalry was employed to improve the strength and to contract the extent of the roman fortifications his labors were interrupted by the alarming intelligence that new swarms of barbarians had passed the unguarded danube either to support the cause or to imitate the example of fritigern the just apprehension that he himself might be surrounded and overwhelmed by the arms of hostile and unknown nations compelled saturninus to relinquish the siege of the gothic camp and the indignant visigoths breaking from their confinement satiated their hunger and revenge by the repeated devastation of the fruitful country

inquiries and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to display his intimate acquaintance with the secrets of the state and the designs of his master the intelligence that gratian was preparing to lead the military force of gaul and of the west to the assistance of his uncle valens pointed out to the restless spirit of the alemanni the moment and the mode of a succesful invasion the enterprise of some light detachments who in the month of february passed the rhine upon the ice was the prelude of a more important war the boldest hopes of rapine perhaps of conquest outweighed the considerations of timid prudence or national faith every forest and every village poured forth a band of hardy adventurers and the great army of the alemanni which on their approach was estimated at forty thousand men by the fears of the people was afterward magnified to the number of seventy thousand by the vain and credulous flattery of the imperial court the legions which had been ordered to march into pannonia were immediately recalled or detained for the defense of gaul the military command was divided between nanienus and mellobaudes and the youthful emperor though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom of the former was much more inclined to admire and to follow the martial ardour of his colleague who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of count of the

perseverance of their enemies their submission was accepted as a proof not indeed of their sincere repentance but of their actual distress and a select number of their brave and robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation as the most substantial pledge of their future moderation the subjects of the empire who had so often experienced that the alemanni could neither be subdued by arms nor restrained by treaties might not promise themselves any solid or lasting tranquillity but they discovered in the virtues of their young sovereign the prospect of a long and auspicious reign when the legions climbed the mountains and scaled the fortifications of the barbarians the valor of gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks and the gilt and variegated armor of his guards was pierced and shattered by the blows which they had received in their constant attachment to the person of their sovereign at the age of nineteen the son of valentinian seemed to possess the talents of

republic he obtained the permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the legions and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of discipline and the exercise of arms which were almost forgotten under the reign of valens by the vigor and conduct of sebastian a large body of the goths was surprised in their camp and the immense spoil which was recovered from their hands filled the city of hadrianople and the adjacent plain the splendid narratives which the general transmitted of his own exploits alarmed the imperial court by the appearance of superior merit and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the gothic war his valor was praised his advice was rejected and valens who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and assured conquest his army was strengthened by a numerous reinforcement of veterans and his march from constantinople to hadrianople was conducted with so much military skill that he prevented the activity of the barbarians who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles and to intercept either the troops themselves or their convoys of provisions the camp of valens which he pitched under the walls of hadrianople was fortified according to the practice of the romans with a ditch and rampart and a most important council was summoned to decide the fate of the emperor and of the empire the party of reason and of delay was strenuously maintained by victor who had corrected by the lessons of experience the native fierceness of the sarmatian character while sebastian with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier represented every precaution and every measure that implied a doubt of immediate victory as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their invincible monarch the ruin of valens was precipitated by the deceitful arts of fritigern and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the west the advantages of negociating in the midst of war were perfectly understood by the general of the barbarians and a christian ecclesiastic was dispatched as the holy minister of peace to penetrate and to perplex the councils of the enemy the misfortunes as well as the provocations of the gothic nation were forcibly and truly described by their ambassador who protested in the name of fritigern that he was still disposed to lay down his arms or to employ them only in the defense of the empire if he could secure for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of thrace and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle but he added in a whisper of confidential friendship that the exasperated barbarians were averse to these reasonable conditions and that fritigern was doubtful whether he could accomplish the conclusion of the treaty unless he found himself supported by the presence and terrors of an imperial army about the same time count richomer returned from the west to announce the defeat and submission of the alemanni to inform valens that his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of gaul and to request in the name of gratian and of the republic that every dangerous and decisive measure might be suspended till the junction of the two emperors should ensure the success of the gothic war but the feeble sovereign of the east was actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy he disdained the importunate advice he rejected the humiliating aid he secretly compared the ignominious at least the inglorious period of his own reign with the fame of a beardless youth and valens rushed into the field to erect his imaginary trophy before the diligence of his colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day  on the ninth of august a day which has deserved to be marked among the most inauspicious of the roman calendar ammianus xxxi       almost alone describes the councils and actions which were terminated by the fatal battle of hadrianople we might censure the vices of his style the disorder and perplexity of his narrative but we must now take leave of this impartial historian and reproach is silenced by our regret for such an irreparable loss  the emperor valens battle of hadrianople a d     aug  th leaving under a strong guard his baggage and military treasure marched from hadrianople to attack the goths who were encamped about twelve miles from the city the difference of the eight miles of ammianus and the twelve of idatius can only embarrass those critics valesius ad loc who suppose a great army to be a mathematical point without space or dimensions  by some mistake of the orders or some ignorance of the ground the right wing or column of cavalry arrived in sight of the enemy whilst the left was still at a considerable distance the soldiers were compelled in the sultry heat of summer to precipitate their pace and the line of battle was formed with tedious confusion and irregular delay the gothic cavalry had been detached to forage in the adjacent country and fritigern still continued to practice his customary arts he dispatched messengers of peace made proposals required hostages and wasted the hours till the romans exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun were exhausted by thirst hunger and intolerable fatigue the emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to the gothic camp the zeal of richomer who alone had courage to accept the dangerous commission was applauded and the count of the domestics adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity had proceeded some way in the space between the two armies when he was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle the hasty and imprudent attack was made by bacurius the iberian who commanded a body of archers and targetteers and as they advanced with rashness they retreated with loss and disgrace in the same moment the flying squadrons of alatheus and saphrax whose return was anxiously expected by the general of the goths descended like a whirlwind from the hills swept across the plain and added new terrors to the tumultuous but irresistible charge of the barbarian host the event of the battle of hadrianople so fatal to valens and to the empire may be described in a few words the defeat of the romans the roman cavalry fled the infantry was abandoned surrounded and cut in pieces the most skilful evolutions the firmest courage are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot encompassed on an open plain by superior numbers of horse but the troops of valens oppressed by the weight of the enemy and their own fears were crowded into a narrow space where it was impossible for them to extend their ranks or even to use with effect their swords and javelins in the midst of tumult of slaughter and of dismay the emperor deserted by his guards and wounded as it was supposed with an arrow sought protection among the lancearii and the mattiarii who still maintained their ground with some appearance of order and firmness his faithful generals trajan and victor who perceived his danger loudly exclaimed that all was lost unless the person of the emperor could be saved some troops animated by their exhortation advanced to his relief they found only a bloody spot covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled bodies without being able to discover their unfortunate prince either among the living or the dead their search could not indeed be successful if there is any truth in the circumstances with which some historians have related the death of the emperor by the care death of the emperor valens of his attendants valens was removed from the field of battle to a neighboring cottage where they attempted to dress his wound and to provide for his future safety but this humble retreat was instantly surrounded by the enemy they tried to force the door they were provoked by a discharge of arrows from the roof till at length impatient of delay they set fire to a pile of dry faggots and consumed the cottage with the roman emperor and his train valens perished in the flames and a youth who dropped from the window alone escaped to attest the melancholy tale and to inform the goths of the inestimable prize which they had lost by their own rashness a great number of brave and distinguished officers perished in the battle of hadrianople which equalled in the actual loss and far surpassed in the fatal consequences the misfortune which rome had formerly sustained in the fields of cannae nec ulla annalibus praeter cannensem pugnam ita ad internecionem res legitur gesta ammian xxxi    according to the grave polybius no more than   0 horse and  000 foot escaped from the field of cannae  0000 were made prisoners and the number of the slain amounted to

world that he was the victim as well as the author of the public calamity above twothirds of the roman army were destroyed and the darkness of the night was esteemed a very favorable circumstance as it served to conceal the flight of the multitude and to protect the more orderly retreat of victor and richomer who alone amidst the general consternation maintained the advantage of calm courage and

and the blood of the barbarians those honorable marks have been already washed away by the rains but the lofty monuments of their bones the bones of generals of centurions and of valiant warriors claim a longer period of duration the king himself fought and fell in the foremost ranks of the battle his attendants presented him with the fleetest horses of the imperial stable that would soon have carried him beyond the pursuit of the enemy they vainly pressed him to reserve his important life for the future service of the republic he still declared that he was unworthy to survive so many of the bravest and most faithful of his subjects and the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the slain let none therefore presume to ascribe the victory of the barbarians to the fear the weakness or the imprudence of the roman troops the chiefs and the soldiers were animated by the virtue of their ancestors whom they equalled in discipline and the arts of war their generous emulation was supported by the love of glory which prompted them to contend at the same time with heat and thirst with fire and the sword and cheerfully to embrace an honorable death as their refuge against flight and infamy the indignation of the gods has been the only cause of the success of our enemies the truth of history may disclaim some parts of this panegyric which cannot strictly be reconciled

stipulated with the fortifications of great and populous cities after the hasty and impolitic massacre of three hundred deserters an act of justice extremely useful to the discipline of the roman armies the goths indignantly raised the siege of hadrianople the scene of war and tumult was instantly converted into a silent solitude the multitude suddenly disappeared the secret paths of the woods

and history when he affirms that in those desert countries nothing was left except the sky and the earth that after the destruction of the cities and the extirpation of the human race the land was overgrown with thick forests and inextricable brambles and that the universal desolation announced by the prophet zephaniah was accomplished in the scarcity of the beasts the birds and even of the fish these complaints were pronounced about twenty years after the death of valens and the illyrian provinces which were constantly exposed to the invasion and passage of the barbarians still continued after a calamitous period of ten centuries to supply new materials for rapine and destruction could it even be supposed that a large tract of country had been left without cultivation and without inhabitants the consequences might not have been so fatal to the inferior productions of animated nature the useful and feeble animals which are nourished by the hand of man might suffer and perish if they were deprived of his protection but the beasts of the forest his enemies or his victims would multiply in the free and undisturbed possession of their solitary domain the various tribes

reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend to the peaceful countries of asia the sons of the goths had been judiciously distributed through the cities of the east and the arts of education were employed to polish and subdue the native fierceness of their temper in the space of about twelve years their numbers had continually increased and the children who in the first emigration were sent over the hellespont had attained with rapid growth the strength and spirit of perfect manhood eunapius in excorpt legate p  0 foolishly supposes a praeternatural growth of the young goths that he may introduce cadmuss armed men who sprung from the dragons teeth etc such was the greek eloquence of the times  it was impossible to conceal from their knowledge the events of the gothic war and as those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation they betrayed their wish their desire perhaps their intention to emulate the glorious example of their fathers the danger of the times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials and these suspicions were admitted as unquestionable evidence that the goths of asia had formed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety the death of valens had left the east without a sovereign and julius who filled the important station of mastergeneral of the troops with a high reputation of diligence and ability thought it his duty to consult the senate of constantinople which he considered during the vacancy of the throne as the representative council of the nation as soon as he had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the good of the republic he assembled the principal officers and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design an order was immediately promulgated that on a stated day the gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces and as a report was industriously circulated that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment and perhaps suspended the motions of the conspiracy on the appointed day the unarmed crowd of the gothic youth was carefully collected in the square or forum the streets and avenues were occupied by the roman troops and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and slingers at the same hour in all the cities of the east the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter and the provinces of asia were delivered by the cruel prudence of julius from a domestic enemy who in a few months might have carried fire and sword from the hellespont to the euphrates ammianus evidently approves this execution efficacia velox et salutaris which concludes his work xxxi    zosimus who is curious and copious l iv p          mistakes the date and labors to find the reason why julius did not consult the emperor theodosius who had not yet ascended the throne of the east  the urgent consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly authorize the violation of every positive law how far that or any other consideration may operate to dissolve the natural obligations of humanity and justice is a doctrine of which i still desire to remain ignorant  the emperor gratian was far advanced on his the emperor gratian invests theodosius with the empire

impatient colleague had been slain in battle and that twothirds of the roman army were exterminated by the sword of the victorious goths whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might deserve the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued by the softer emotions of grief and compassion and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic gratian was too late to assist he was too weak to revenge his unfortunate colleague and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world a formidable tempest of the barbarians of germany seemed ready to burst over the provinces of gaul and the mind of gratian was oppressed and distracted by the administration of the western empire in this important crisis the government of the east and the conduct of the gothic war required the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman a subject invested with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor and the imperial council embraced the wise and manly resolution of conferring an obligation rather than of yielding to an insult it was the wish of gratian to bestow the purple as the reward of virtue but at the age of nineteen it is not easy for a prince educated in the supreme rank to understand the true characters of his ministers and generals he attempted to weigh with an impartial hand their various merits and defects and whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of the republic as each moment of delay diminished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the east the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate the choice of gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile whose father only three years before had suffered under the sanction of his authority an unjust and ignominious death the great theodosius a name celebrated in history

princes who peaceably inherit the scepter of their fathers claim and enjoy a legal right the more secure as it is absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters the subjects who in a monarchy or a popular state acquire the possession of supreme power may have raised themselves by the superiority either of genius or virtue above the heads of their equals but their virtue is seldom exempt from ambition and the cause of the successful candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy or civil war even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to declare a colleague or a successor his partial choice which may be influenced by the blindest passions is often directed to an unworthy object but the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to theodosius in his obscure solitude of caucha the arts the desires or even the hopes of an ambitious statesman and the name of the exile would long since have been forgotten if his genuine and distinguished virtues had not left a deep impression in the imperial court during the season of prosperity he had been neglected but in the public distress his superior merit was universally felt and acknowledged what confidence must have been reposed in his integrity since gratian could trust that a pious son would forgive for the sake of the republic the murder of his father what expectations must have been formed of his abilities to encourage the hope that a single man could save and restore the empire of the east theodosius was invested with the purple in the thirtythird year of his age the vulgar gazed with admiration on the manly beauty of his face and the graceful majesty of his person which they were pleased to compare with the pictures and medals of the emperor trajan whilst intelligent

figurative style of poetry or panegyric and by the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers who in the heat of religious faction are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation conscious of these disadvantages which will continue to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the roman empire i shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps yet i may boldly pronounce that the battle of hadrianople was never revenged by any signal or decisive victory of theodosius over the barbarians and the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the observation of the condition and circumstances of the times the fabric of a mighty state which has been reared by the labors of successive ages could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the calamity the loss of forty thousand romans who fell in the plains of hadrianople might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces of the east which contained so many millions of inhabitants the courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions if the barbarians were mounted on the horses and equipped with the armor of their vanquished enemies the numerous studs of cappadocia and spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry the thirtyfour arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms and the wealth of asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war but the effects which were produced by the battle of hadrianople on the minds of the barbarians and of the romans extended the victory of the former and the defeat of the latter far beyond the limits of a single day a gothic chief was heard to declare with insolent moderation that for his own part he was fatigued with slaughter but that he was astonished how a people who fled before him like a flock of sheep could still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces chrysostom tom i p     edit montfaucon i have verified and examined this passage but i should never without the aid of tillemont hist des emp tom v p     have detected an historical anecdote in a strange medley of moral and mystic exhortations addressed by the preacher of antioch to a young widow  the same terrors which the name of the huns had spread among the gothic tribes were inspired by the formidable name of the goths among the subjects and soldiers of the roman empire eunapius in excerpt legation p     if theodosius hastily collecting his scattered forces had led them into the field to encounter a victorious enemy his army would have been vanquished by their own fears and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of success but the great theodosius an epithet which he honorably deserved on this momentous occasion conducted himself as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic he fixed his headquarters at thessalonica the capital of the macedonian diocese see godefroys chronology of the laws codex theodos tom i prolegomen p xcix  civ  from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the barbarians and direct the operations of his lieutenants from the gates of constantinople to the shores of the hadriatic the fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened and the troops among whom a sense of order and discipline was revived were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of their own safety from these secure stations they were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the barbarians who infested the adjacent country and as they were seldom allowed to engage without some decisive superiority either of ground or of numbers their enterprises were for the most part successful and they were soon convinced by their own experience of the possibility of vanquishing their invincible enemies the detachments of these separate garrisons were gradually united into small armies the same cautious measures were pursued according to an extensive and wellconcerted plan of operations the events of each day added strength and spirit to the roman arms and the artful diligence of the emperor who circulated the most favorable reports of the success of the war contributed to subdue the pride of the barbarians and to animate the hopes and courage of his subjects if instead of this faint and imperfect outline we could accurately represent the counsels and actions of theodosius in four successive campaigns there is reason to believe that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of every military reader the republic had formerly been saved by the delays of fabius and while the splendid trophies of scipio in the field of zama attract the eyes of posterity the camps and marches of the dictator among the hills of campania may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame which the general is not compelled to share either with fortune or with his troops such was likewise the merit of theodosius and the infirmities of his body which most unseasonably languished under a long and dangerous disease could not oppress the vigor of his mind or divert his attention from the public service most writers insist on the illness and long repose of theodosius at thessalonica zosimus to diminish his glory jornandes to favor the goths and the ecclesiastical writers to introduce his baptism

not easily reconciled was the work of prudence rather than of valor the prudence of theodosius was seconded by fortune and the emperor never failed to seize and to improve every favorable circumstance as long as the superior genius of fritigern preserved the union and directed the motions of the barbarians their power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire the death of that hero the predecessor and master of the renowned alaric relieved an impatient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and discretion the barbarians who had been restrained by his authority abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions and their passions were seldom uniform or consistent an army of conquerors was broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers and their blind and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves than to their enemies their mischievous disposition was shown in the destruction of every object which they wanted strength to remove or taste to enjoy and they often consumed with improvident rage the harvests or the granaries which soon afterward became necessary for their own subsistence a spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations which had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary alliance the troops of the huns and the alani would naturally upbraid the flight of the goths who were not disposed to use with moderation the advantages of their fortune the ancient jealousy of the ostrogoths and the visigoths could not long be suspended and the haughty chiefs still remembered the insults and injuries which they had reciprocally offered or sustained while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the danube the progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity and the officers of theodosius were instructed to purchase with liberal gifts and promises the retreat or service of the discontented party the acquisition of modar a prince of the royal blood of the amali gave a bold and faithful champion to the cause of rome the illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of mastergeneral with an important command surprised an army of his countrymen who were immersed in wine and sleep and after a cruel slaughter of the astonished goths returned with an immense spoil and four thousand wagons to the imperial camp zosimus l iv p     styles him a scythian a name which the more recent greeks seem to have appropriated to the goths  in the hands of a skilful politician the most different means may be successfully applied to the same ends and the peace of the empire which had been forwarded by the divisions was accomplished by the reunion of the gothic nation athanaric who had been a patient death and funeral of athanaric a d     jan    spectator of these extraordinary events was at length driven by the chance of arms from the dark recesses of the woods of caucaland he no longer hesitated to pass the danube and a very considerable part of the subjects of fritigern who already felt the inconveniences of anarchy were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a gothic judge whose birth they respected and whose abilities they had frequently experienced but age had chilled the daring spirit of athanaric and instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory he wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honorable and advantageous treaty theodosius who was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from constantinople and entertained him in the imperial city with the confidence of a friend and the magnificence of a monarch the barbarian prince observed with curious attention the variety of objects which attracted his notice and at last broke out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder i now behold said he what i never could believe the glories of this stupendous capital and as he cast his eyes around he viewed and he admired the commanding situation of the city the strength and beauty of the walls and public edifices the capacious harbor crowded with innumerable vessels the perpetual concourse of distant nations and the arms and discipline of the troops indeed continued athanaric the emperor of the romans is a god upon earth and the presumptuous man who dares to lift his hand against him is guilty of his own blood the reader will not be displeased to see the original words of jornandes or the author whom he transcribed regiam urbem ingressus est miransque en inquit cerno quod saepe incredulus audiebam famam videlicet tantae urbis et huc illuc oculos volvens nunc situm urbis commeatumque navium nunc moenia clara prospectans miratur populosque diversarum gentium quasi font in uno e diversis

p   0 proceeds to mention his death and funeral  the gothic king did not long enjoy this splendid and honorable reception and as temperance was not the virtue of his nation it may justly be suspected that his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of the imperial banquets but the policy of theodosius derived more solid benefit from the death than he could have expected from the most faithful services of his ally the funeral of athanaric was performed with solemn rites in the capital of the east a stately monument was erected to his memory and his whole army won by the liberal courtesy and decent grief of theodosius enlisted under the standard of the roman empire jornandes c xxviii p   0 even zosimus l iv p     is compelled to approve the generosity of theodosius so honorable to himself and so beneficial to the public  the submission of so great a body of the visigoths was productive of the most salutary consequences and the mixed influence of force of reason and of corruption became every day more powerful and more extensive each independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty from the apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose him alone and unprotected to the revenge or justice of the conqueror the general or rather the final capitulation of the goths may be dated four years one month and twentyfive days after the defeat and death of the

gruthingi or ostrogoths by the voluntary retreat of alatheus and saphrax whose restless spirit had prompted them to seek new scenes of rapine and glory their destructive course was pointed toward the west but we must be satisfied with a very obscure and imperfect knowledge of their various adventures the ostrogoths impelled several of the german tribes on the provinces of gaul concluded and soon violated a treaty with the emperor gratian advanced into the unknown countries of the north and after an interval of more than four years returned with accumulated force to the banks of the lower danube their troops were recruited with the fiercest warriors of germany and scythia and the soldiers or at least the historians of the empire no longer recognized the name and countenances of their former enemies  zosimus l iv p      the general who commanded the military and naval powers of the thracian frontier soon perceived that his superiority would be disadvantageous to the public service and that the barbarians awed by the presence of his fleet and legions would probably defer the passage of the river till the approaching winter the dexterity of the spies whom he sent into the gothic camp allured the barbarians into a fatal snare they were persuaded that by a bold attempt they might surprise in the silence and darkness of the night the sleeping army of the romans and the whole multitude was hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes i am justified by reason and example in applying this indian name to the  of the barbarians the single trees hollowed into the shape of a boat  zosimus l iv p     ausi danubium quondam tranare gruthungi in lintres fregere nemus ter mill ruebant per fluvium plenae cuneis immanibus alni claudian in iv cons hon        the bravest of the ostrogoths led the van the main body consisted of the remainder of their subjects and soldiers and the women and children securely followed in the rear one of the nights without a moon had been selected for the execution of their design and they had almost reached the southern bank of the danube in the firm confidence that they should find an easy landing and an unguarded camp but the progress of the barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line of vessels strongly connected with each other and which formed an impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river while they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict their right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys which were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the tide the weight and velocity of those ships of war broke and sunk and dispersed the rude and feeble canoes of the barbarians their valor was ineffectual and alatheus the king or general of the ostrogoths perished with his bravest troops either by the sword of the romans or in the waves of the danube the last division of this unfortunate fleet might regain the opposite shore but the distress and disorder of the multitude rendered them alike incapable either of action or counsel and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy on this occasion as well as on many others it is a difficult task to reconcile the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of theodosius the partial and malignant historian who misrepresents every action of his reign affirms that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the barbarians had been vanquished by the valor and conduct of his lieutenant promotus zosimus l iv p          he too frequently betrays his poverty of judgment by disgracing the most serious narratives with trifling and incredible circumstances  the flattering poet who celebrated in the court of honorius the glory of the father and of the son ascribes the victory to the personal prowess of theodosius and almost insinuates that the king of the ostrogoths was slain by the hand of the emperor  odothaei regis opima retulit  ver     the opima were the spoils which a roman general could only win from the king or general of the enemy whom he had slain with his own hands and no more than three such examples are celebrated in the victorious ages of rome    the truth of history might perhaps be found in a just medium between these extreme and contradictory assertions  the original treaty which fixed the settlement settlement of the goths in thrace and asia a d          of the goths ascertained their privileges and stipulated their obligations would illustrate the history of theodosius and his successors the series of their history has imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this singular agreement see themistius orat xvi p     claudian in eutrop l ii     mentions the phrygian colony   ostrogothis colitur mistisque gruthungis phryx ager  and then proceeds to name the rivers of lydia the pactolus and hermus    the ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile but uncultivated land for the use of those barbarians who might not disdain the practice of agriculture a numerous colony of the visigoths was seated in thrace the remains of the ostrogoths were planted in phrygia and lydia their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle and their future industry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute during a certain term of years the barbarians would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the imperial court if they had suffered themselves to be dispersed through the provinces they required and they obtained the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their residence they still cherished and propagated their native manners and language asserted in the bosom of despotism the freedom of their domestic government and acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and magistrates of rome the hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war but the royal dignity was abolished and the generals of the goths were appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor an army of forty thousand goths was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of the east and those haughty troops who assumed the title of foederati or allies were distinguished by their gold collars liberal pay and licentious privileges their native courage was improved by the use of arms and the knowledge of discipline and while the republic was guarded or threatened by the doubtful sword of the barbarians the last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds of the romans compare jornandes c xx    who marks the condition and number of the gothic foederati with zosimus l iv p     who mentions their golden collars and pacatus in panegyr vet xii    who applauds with false or foolish joy their bravery and discipline  theodosius had the address to persuade his allies that the conditions of peace which had been extorted from him by prudence and necessity were the voluntary expressions of his sincere friendship for the gothic nation amator pacis generisque gothorum is the praise bestowed by the gothic historian c xxix who represents his nation as innocent peaceable men slow to anger and patient of injuries according to livy the romans conquered the world in their own defense  a different mode of vindication or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous concessions besides the partial invectives of zosimus always discontented with the christian reigns see the grave representations which synesius addresses to the emperor arcadius de regno p       edit petav the philosophic bishop of cyrene was near enough to judge and he was sufficiently removed from the temptation of fear or flattery  the calamities of the war were painted in the most lively colors and the first symptoms of the return of order of plenty and security were diligently exaggerated the advocates of theodosius could affirm with some appearance of truth and reason that it was impossible to extirpate so many warlike tribes who were rendered desperate by the loss of their native country and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen the barbarians still wore an angry and hostile aspect but the experience of past times might encourage the hope that they would acquire the habits of industry and obedience that their manners would be polished by time education and the influence of christianity and that their posterity would insensibly blend with the great body of the roman people themistius orat xvi p         composes an elaborate and rational apology which is not however exempt from the puerilities of greek rhetoric orpheus could only charm the wild beasts of thrace but theodosius enchanted the men and women whose predecessors in the same country had torn orpheus in pieces etc   notwithstanding these specious arguments and their hostile sentiments these sanguine expectations it was apparent to every discerning eye that the goths would long remain the enemies and might soon become the conquerors of the roman empire their rude and insolent behavior expressed their contempt of the citizens and provincials whom they insulted with impunity constantinople was deprived half a day of the public allowance of bread to expiate the murder of a gothic soldier  was the guilt of the people libanius orat xii p     edit morel  to the zeal and valor of the barbarians theodosius was indebted for the success of his arms but their assistance was precarious and they were sometimes seduced by a treacherous and inconstant disposition to abandon his standard at the moment when their service was the most essential during the civil war against maximus a great number of gothic deserters retired into the morasses of macedonia wasted the adjacent provinces and obliged the intrepid monarch to expose his person and exert his power to suppress the rising flame of rebellion zosimus l iv p          he tells a long and ridiculous story of the adventurous prince who roved the country with only five horsemen of a spy whom they detected whipped and killed in an old womans cottage etc  the public apprehensions were fortified by the strong suspicion that these tumults were not the effect of accidental passion but the result of deep and premeditated design it was generally believed that the goths had signed the treaty of peace with an hostile and insidious spirit and that their chiefs had previously bound themselves by a solemn and secret oath never to keep faith with the romans to maintain the fairest show of loyalty and friendship and to watch the favorable moment of rapine of conquest and of revenge but as the minds of the barbarians were not insensible to the power of gratitude several of the gothic leaders sincerely devoted themselves to the service of the empire or at least of the emperor the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite factions and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute to compare the obligations of their first and second engagements the goths who considered themselves as the friends of peace of justice and of rome were directed by the authority of fravitta a valiant and honorable youth distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the politeness of his manners the liberality of his sentiments and the mild virtues of social life but the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless priulf who inflamed the passions and asserted the independence of his warlike followers on one of the solemn festivals when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the imperial table they were insensibly heated by wine till they forgot the usual restraints of discretion and respect and betrayed in the presence of theodosius the fatal secret of their domestic disputes the emperor who had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary controversy dissembled his fears and resentment and soon dismissed the tumultuous assembly fravitta alarmed and exasperated by the insolence of his rival whose departure from the palace might have been the signal of a civil war boldly followed him and drawing his sword laid priulf dead at his feet their companions flew to arms and the faithful champion of rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers if he had not been protected by the seasonable interposition of the imperial guards compare eunapius in excerpt legate p       with zosimus l iv p     the difference of circumstances and names must undoubtedly be applied to the same story fravitta or travitta was afterward consul a d  0  and still continued his faithful service to the eldest son of theodosius tillemont hist des empereurs tom v p      such were the scenes of barbaric rage which disgraced the palace and
