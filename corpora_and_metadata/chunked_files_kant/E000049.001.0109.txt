is called the judge or the court judex s forum what anyone does in accordance with duty beyond what he can be compelled to by the law is meritorious meritum what he does only just in accordance with the law is duty owed debitum lastly what he does less than the law demands is moral demerit demeritum the legal effect of demerit is punishment pæna that of a meritorious act reward præmium 0 provided that this promised in the law was the motive conduct which agrees with duty owed has no legal effect fair recompense remuneratio s repensio benefica stands in no legal relation to the deed the good or bad consequences of an obligatory action or the consequences of omitting a meritorious action can not be imputed to the agent modus imputationis tollens the good consequences of a meritorious action and the bad consequences of an unlawful action can be imputed modus imputationis ponens subjectively considered the degree of imputability imputabilitas of actions must be estimated by the greatness of the hindrances which have to be overcome the greater the natural hindrances of sensibility and the less the moral hindrance of duty the higher the imputation of merit in a good deed for example if at a considerable sacrifice i rescue from great necessity one who is a complete stranger to myself on the other hand the less the natural hindrance and the greater the hindrance from reasons of duty so much the more is transgression imputed as ill desert hence the state of mind of the agent whether he acted in the excitement of passion or with cool deliberation makes an important difference in imputation preface to the metaphysical elements of ethics if there exists on any subject a philosophy that is a system of rational knowledge based on concepts then there must also be for this philosophy a system of pure rational concepts independent on any condition of intuition—in other words a metaphysic it may be asked whether metaphysical elements are required also for every practical philosophy which is the doctrine of duties deontology and therefore also for ethics in order to be able to present it as a true science systematically not merely as an aggregate of separate doctrines fragmentarily as regards pure jurisprudence no one will question this requirement for it concerns only what is formal in the elective will which has to be limited in its external relations according to laws of freedom without regarding any end which is the matter of this will here therefore deontology is a mere scientific doctrine doctrina scientiæ now in this philosophy of ethics it seems contrary to the idea of it that we should go back to metaphysical elements in order to make the notion of duty purified from everything empirical from every feeling a motive of action for what sort of notion can we form of the mighty power and herculean strength which would be sufficient to overcome the vicebreeding inclinations if virtue is to borrow her arms from the armoury of metaphysics which is a matter of speculation that only few men can handle hence all ethical teaching in lecturerooms pulpits and popular books when it is decked out with fragments of metaphysics becomes ridiculous but it is not therefore useless much less ridiculous to trace in metaphysics the first principles of ethics for it is only as a philosopher than any one can reach the first principles of this conception of duty otherwise we could not look for either certainty or purity in the ethical teaching to rely for this reason on a certain feeling or sense which on account of the effect expected from it is called moral may perhaps even satisfy the popular teacher provided he desires as the criterion of a moral duty to consider the problem if everyone in every case made your maxim the universal law how could this law be consistent with itself but if it were merely feeling that made it our duty to take this principle as a criterion then this would not be dictated by reason but only adopted instinctively and therefore blindly but in fact whatever men imagine no moral principle is based on any feeling but such a principle is really nothing else than an obscurely conceived metaphysic which inheres in every mans reasoning faculty as the teacher will easily find who tries to catechize his pupil in the socratic method about the imperative of duty and its application to the moral judgment of his actions the mode of stating it need not be always metaphysical and the language need not necessarily be scholastic unless the pupil is to be trained to be a philosopher but the thought must go back to the elements of metaphysics without which we can not expect any certainty or purity or even motive power in ethics if we deviate from this principle and begin from pathological or purely sensitive or even moral feeling from what is subjectively practical instead of what is objective that is from the matter of the will the end not from its form that is the law in order from thence to determine duties then certainly there are no metaphysical elements of ethics for feeling by whatever it may be excited is always physical but then ethical teaching whether in schools or lecturerooms c is corrupted in its source for it is not a matter of indifference by what motives or means one is led to a good purpose the obedience to duty however disgusting then metaphysics may appear to those pretended philosophers who dogmatize oracularly or even brilliantly about the doctrine of duty it is nevertheless an indispensable duty for those who oppose it to go back to its principles even in ethics and to begin by going to school on its benches 0 we may fairly wonder how after all previous explanations of the principles of duty so far as it is derived from pure reason it was still possible to
