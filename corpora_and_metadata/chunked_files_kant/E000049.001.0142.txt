into an idea of beauty which is merely a chimera of his own brain would fain conclude that such an object really exists somewhere 0 i quite agree with him in this in all cases where the want is founded on inclination which can not necessarily postulate the existence of its object even for the man that is affected by it much less can it contain a demand valid for everyone and therefore it is merely a subjective ground of the wish but in the present case we have a want of reason springing from an objective determining principle of the will namely the moral law which necessarily binds every rational being and therefore justifies him in assuming à priori in nature the conditions proper for it and makes the latter inseparable from the complete practical use of reason it is a duty to realize the summum bonum to the utmost of our power therefore it must be possible consequently it is unavoidable for every rational being in the world to assume what is necessary for its objective possibility the assumption is as necessary as the moral law in connexion with which alone it is valid read wie for die it is quite proper to extol actions that display a great unselfish sympathizing mind or humanity but in this case we must fix attention not so much on the elevation of soul which is very fleeting and transitory as on the subjection of the heart to duty from which a more enduring impression may be expected because this implies principle whereas the former only implies ebullitions one need only reflect a little and he will always find a debt that he has by some means incurred towards the human race even if it were only this that by the inequality of men in the civil constitution he enjoys advantages on account of which others must be the more in want which will prevent the thought of duty from being repressed by the selfcomplacent imagination of merit weisheitslehre vernacular german for philosophy see p 0 to this definition it has been objected that it comes to nothing as soon as we abstract from external conditions of the result of the desire yet even to the idealist the appetitive faculty is something although to him the external world is nothing answer is there not such a thing as an earnest longing which yet we are conscious is in vain ex gr would to god that man were still living and which though it leads to no deed is yet not without results and has a powerful effect not indeed on outward things but within the subject himself making him ill a desire being an effort nisus to be by means of ones ideas a cause still even though the subject perceives the inadequacy of these to produce the desired effect is always a causality at least within the subject what causes the mistake here is this that since the consciousness of our power generally in the given case is at the same time a consciousness of our powerlessness in respect to the outer world the definition is not applicable to the idealist although as here we are speaking only of the relation of a cause the idea to the effect feeling the causality of the idea in respect of its object whether that causality be internal or external must inevitably be included in the conception of the appetitive faculty—rechtslehre anhang to second edition p 0 we might define sensibility as the subjective element in our ideas for it is the understanding that first refers the ideas to an object i e it alone thinks somewhat by means thereof now the subjective element of our idea may be of such a kind that it can also be referred to an object as contributory to the knowledge of it either as to the form or the matter being called in the former case intuition in the latter sensation in this case sensibility which is the susceptibility to the idea in question is sense or again the subjective element of the idea may be such that it can not become a piece of knowledge inasmuch as it contains merely the relation of this idea to the subject and nothing that is useful for the knowledge of the object and in this case this susceptibility to the idea is called feeling which contains the effect of the idea whether sensible or intellectual on the subject and this belongs to the sensibility even though the idea itself may belong to the understanding or the reason this important distinction is here explicitly made for the first time in the earlier treatises the word wille covers both significations in writing the kritik kant saw that much confusion of thought was traceable to the use of the same word for two very different things and in that treatise he sometimes uses willkühr his use of the term is of course his own in the last treatise in the present volume the word wille occurs only once or twice in default of an english word suitable to be appropriated to the signification of kants willkühr i have adopted the compound term elective will reserving rational will for wille although the distinction has not been fixed in appropriate terms it has been felt and more or less obscurely indicated by many moralists indeed it is implied in s pauls epistle to the romans ch vii where for instance in v the subject of θέλω is i as wille while that of ποιωˆ is i as willkühr compare the words of kant on the corrupt heart coexisting with the good wille p when philosophy as containing principles of the rational knowledge of things through concepts not merely as logic does principles of the form of thought in general without distinction of its objects is divided into theoretical and practical this is quite right but then the concepts which assign to the principles of
