of an imperative of this kind can be supplied by any other practical doctrine but that which prescribes obligation the doctrine of morals all other imperatives are technical and conditioned the ground of the possibility of categorical imperatives lies in this that they refer to no other property of the elective will by which any purpose could be ascribed to it but only to its freedom an action is allowed licitum which is not contrary to obligation and this freedom which is not limited by any opposed imperative is called right of action facultas moralis befugniss hence it is obvious what is meant by disallowed illicitum duty is the action to which a person is bound it is therefore the matter of obligation and it may be one and the same duty as to the action although the obligation to it may be of different kinds the categorical imperative since it expresses an obligation in respect of certain actions is a moral practical law but since obligation contains not only practical necessity which law in general expresses but also constraint the imperative mentioned is either a law of command or of prohibition according as the performance or omission is represented as duty an action which is neither commanded nor forbidden is merely allowed because in respect of it there is no law limiting freedom right of action and therefore also no duty such an action is called morally indifferent indifferens adiaphoron res meræ facultatis it may be asked are there any such and if there are then in order that one may be free to do or forbear a thing as he pleases must there be besides the law of command lex præceptiva lex mandati and the law of prohibition lex prohibitiva lex vetiti also a law of permission lex permissiva if this is the case then the right of action would not be concerned with an indifferent action adiaphoron for if such an action is considered according to moral laws it could not require any special law an action is called a deed in so far as it comes under laws of obligation and consequently in so far as the subject is regarded in it according to the freedom of his elective will the agent is regarded as by such an act the author of the effect and this along with the action itself may be imputed to him if he is previously acquainted with the law by virtue of which an obligation rests on him a person is the subject whose actions are capable of imputation hence moral personality is nothing but the freedom of a rational being under moral laws whereas psychological personality is merely the power of being conscious to oneself of the identity of ones existence in different circumstances hence it follows that a person is subject to no other laws than those which he either alone or jointly with others gives to himself 0 that which is not capable of any imputation is called a thing every object of free elective will which is not itself possessed of freedom is therefore called a thing res corporalis a deed is right or wrong in general rectum aut minus rectum according as it is consistent or inconsistent with duty factum licitum aut illicitum no matter what the content or the origin of the duty may be a deed inconsistent with duty is called transgression reatus an unintentional transgression which however may be imputed is called mere fault culpa an intentional transgression that is one which is accompanied by the consciousness that it is transgression is called crime dolus that which is right according to external laws is called just justum what is not so is unjust injustum a conflict of duties collisio officiorum seu obligationum would be such a relation between them that one would wholly or partially abolish the other now as duty and obligation are notions which express the objective practical necessity of certain actions and as two opposite rules can not be necessary at the same time but if it is a duty to act according to one of them it is then not only not a duty but inconsistent with duty to act according to the other it follows that a conflict of duties and obligations is inconceivable obligationes non colliduntur it may however very well happen that in the same subject and the rule which he prescribes to himself there are conjoined two grounds of obligation rationes obligandi of which however one or the other is inadequate to oblige rationes obligandi non obligantes and then one of them is not a duty when two such grounds are in conflict practical philosophy does not say that the stronger obligation prevails fortior obligatio vincit but the stronger ground of obligation prevails fortior obligandi ratio vincit binding laws for which an external lawgiving is possible are called in general external laws leges externæ amongst these the laws the obligation to which can be recognized by reason à priori even without external legislation are natural though external laws those on the contrary which without actual external legislation would not bind at all and therefore would not be laws are called positive laws it is possible therefore to conceive an external legislation which would only contain positive laws but then a natural law must precede which should supply the ground of the authority of the lawgiver that is his right to bind others by his mere will the principle which makes certain actions a duty is a practical law the rule which the agent adopts from subjective grounds as his principle is called his maxim hence with the same laws the maxims of the agents may be very different the categorical imperative which only expresses in general what obligation is is this act according to a maxim which can at the same time hold good as a universal law you must therefore examine your actions in the first place as to their subjective principle but whether
