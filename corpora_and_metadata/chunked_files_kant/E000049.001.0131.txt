our feeling for duty as if obedience to it were something extraordinary and meritorious there is however one thing in our soul which when we take a right view of it we can not cease to regard with the highest astonishment and in regard to which admiration is right or even elevating and that is the original moral capacity in us generally what is that in us we may ask ourselves by which we who are constantly dependent on nature by so many wants are yet raised so far above it in the idea of an original capacity in us that we regard them all as nothing and ourselves as unworthy of existence if we were to indulge in their satisfaction in opposition to a law which our reason authoritatively prescribes although it is this enjoyment alone that can make life desirable while reason neither promises anything nor threatens the importance of this question must be deeply felt by every man of the most ordinary ability who has been previously instructed as to the holiness that lies in the idea of duty but who has not yet ascended to the investigation of the notion of freedom which first arises from this law and even the incomprehensibility of this capacity a capacity which proclaims a divine origin must rouse his spirit to enthusiasm and strengthen it for any sacrifices which respect for this duty may impose on him the frequent excitement of this feeling of the sublimity of a mans moral constitution is especially to be recommended as a means of awaking moral sentiments since it operates in direct opposition to the innate propensity to pervert the springs in the maxims of our elective will and tends to make unconditional respect for the law the ultimate condition of the admission of all maxims and so restores the original moral subordination of the springs of action and the capacity for good in the human heart in its primitive purity but is not this restoration by ones own strength directly opposed to the thesis of the innate corruption of man for everything good undoubtedly as far as conceivability is concerned that is to say our discernment of its possibility just as with everything which has to be regarded as an event in time change and as such necessarily determined by laws of nature whilst its opposite must yet be regarded as possible by freedom in accordance with moral laws but it is not opposed to the possibility of this restoration itself for if the moral law commands that we shall now be better men it follows inevitably that we also can be better the thesis of innate evil has no application in dogmatic morality for its precepts contain the very same duties and continue in the same force whether there is in us an innate propensity to transgression or not in the culture of morality this thesis has more significance but still it means no more than this that in the moral cultivation of the moral capacity for good created in us we can not begin from a natural state of innocence but must start from the supposition of a depravity of the elective will in assuming maxims that are contrary to the original moral capacity and since the propensity thereto is ineradicable with an unceasing effort against it now as this only leads to a progress in infinitum from bad to better it follows that the transformation of the disposition of a bad into that of a good man is to be placed in the change of the supreme inner principle of all his maxims in accordance with the moral law provided that this new principle the new heart be itself immutable a man can not however naturally attain the conviction that it is immutable either by immediate consciousness or by the proof derived from the course of life he has hitherto pursued for the bottom of his heart the subjective first principle of his maxims is inscrutable to himself but unto the path that leads to it and which is pointed out to him by a fundamentally improved disposition he must be able to hope to arrive by his own efforts since he ought to become a good man and can only be esteemed morally good by virtue of that which can be imputed to him as done by himself now reason which is naturally disinclined to moral effort 0 opposes to this expectation of selfimprovement all sorts of corrupt ideas of religion under the pretext of natural impotence among which is to be reckoned attributing to god himself the adoption of the principle of happiness as the supreme condition of his commands now we may divide all religions into two classesâ€”favourseeking religion mere worship and moral religion that is the religion of a good life by the former a man either flatters himself that god can make him eternally happy by remission of his demerits without his having any need to become a better man or if this does not seem possible to him that god can make him a better man without his having to do anything in the matter himself except to ask for it which as before an allseeing being asking is no more than wishing would in fact be doing nothing for if the mere wish were sufficient every man would be good but in the moral religion and amongst all the public religions that have ever existed the christian alone is moral it is a fundamental principle that everyone must do as much as lies in his power to become a better man and that it is only when he has not buried his innate talent luke xix when he has used the original capacity for good so as to become a better man that he can hope that what is not in his power will be supplied by a higher cooperation but it is not absolutely necessary that man should know in what this
