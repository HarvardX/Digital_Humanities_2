of rendering the system of morals more complete and intelligible and its rules more convenient for use especially for disputation but not so as to draw off the common understanding from its happy simplicity or to bring it by means of philosophy into a new path of inquiry and instruction innocence is indeed a glorious thing only on the other hand it is very sad that it can not well maintain itself and is easily seduced on this account even wisdom—which otherwise consists more in conduct than in knowledge—yet has need of science not in order to learn from it but to secure for its precepts admission and permanence against all the commands of duty which reason represents to man as so deserving of repect he feels in himself a powerful counterpoise in his wants and inclinations the entire satisfaction of which he sums up under the name of happiness now reason issues its commands unyieldingly without promising anything to the inclinations and as it were with disregard and contempt for these claims which are so impetuous and at the same time so plausible and which will not allow themselves to be suppressed by any command hence there arises a natural dialectic i e a disposition to argue against these strict laws of duty and to question their validity or at least their purity and strictness and if possible to make them more accordant with our wishes and inclinations that is to say to corrupt them at their very source and entirely to destroy their worth—a thing which even common practical reason can not ultimately call good thus is the common reason of man compelled to go out of its sphere and to take a step into the field of a practical philosophy not to satisfy any speculative want which never occurs to it as long as it is content to be mere sound reason but even on practical grounds in order to attain in it information and clear instruction respecting the source of its principle and the correct determination of it in opposition to the maxims which are based on wants and inclinations so that it may escape from the perplexity of opposite claims and not run the risk of losing all genuine moral principles through the equivocation into which it easily falls thus when practical reason cultivates itself there insensibly arises in it a dialectic which forces it to seek aid in philosophy just as happens to it in its theoretic use and in this case therefore as well as in the other it will find rest nowhere but in a thorough critical examination of our reason second section transition from popular moral philosophy to the metaphysic of morals if we have hitherto drawn our notion of duty from the common use of our practical reason it is by no means to be inferred that we have treated it as an empirical notion on the contrary if we attend to the experience of mens conduct we meet frequent and as we ourselves allow just complaints that one can not find a single certain example of the disposition to act from pure duty although many things are done in conformity with what duty prescribes it is nevertheless always doubtful whether they are done strictly from duty so as to have a moral worth hence there have at all times been philosophers who have altogether denied that this disposition actually exists at all in human actions and have ascribed everything to a more or less refined selflove not that they have on that account questioned the soundness of the conception of morality on the contrary they spoke with sincere regret of the frailty and corruption of human nature which though noble enough to take as its rule an idea so worthy of respect is yet too weak to follow it and employs reason which ought to give it the law only for the purpose of providing for the interest of the inclinations whether singly or at the best in the greatest possible harmony with one another in fact it is absolutely impossible to make out by experience with complete certainty a single case in which the maxim of an action however right in itself rested simply on moral grounds and on the conception of duty sometimes it happens that with the sharpest selfexamination we can find nothing beside the moral principle of duty which could have been powerful enough to move us to this or that action and to so great a sacrifice yet we can not from this infer with certainty that it was not really some secret impulse of selflove under the false appearance of duty that was the actual determining cause of the will we like then to flatter ourselves by falsely taking credit for a more noble motive whereas in fact we can never even by the strictest examination get completely behind the secret springs of action since when the question is of moral worth it is not with the actions which we see that we are concerned but with those inward principles of them which we do not see moreover we can not better serve the wishes of those who ridicule all morality as a mere chimera of human imagination overstepping itself from vanity than by conceding to them that notions of duty must be drawn only from experience as from indolence people are ready to think is also the case with all other notions for this is to prepare for them a certain triumph i am willing to admit out of love of humanity that even most of our actions are correct but if we look closer at them we everywhere come upon the dear self which is always prominent and it is this they have in view and not the strict command of duty which would often require selfdenial 0 without being an enemy of virtue a cool observer one that does not mistake the wish for good however lively for its reality
