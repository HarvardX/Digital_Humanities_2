case if the general desire for happiness did not influence his will and supposing that in his particular case health was not a necessary element in this calculation there yet remains in this as in all other cases this law namely that he should promote his happiness not from inclination but from duty and by this would his conduct first acquire true moral worth it is in this manner undoubtedly that we are to understand those passages of scripture also in which we are commanded to love our neighbour even our enemy for love as an affection can not be commanded but beneficence for dutys sake may even though we are not impelled to it by any inclination—nay are even repelled by a natural and unconquerable aversion this is practical love and not pathological—a love which is seated in the will and not in the propensions of sense—in principles of action and not of tender sympathy and it is this love alone which can be commanded the second proposition is that an action done from duty derives its moral worth not from the purpose which is to be attained by it but from the maxim by which it is determined and therefore does not depend on the realization of the object of the action but merely on the principle of volition by which the action has taken place without regard to any object of desire 0 it is clear from what precedes that the purposes which we may have in view in our actions or their effects regarded as ends and springs of the will can not give to actions any unconditional or moral worth in what then can their worth lie if it is not to consist in the will and in reference to its expected effect it can not lie anywhere but in the principle of the will without regard to the ends which can be attained by the action for the will stands between its à priori principle which is formal and its à posteriori spring which is material as between two roads and as it must be determined by something it follows that it must be determined by the formal principle of volition when an action is done from duty in which case every material principle has been withdrawn from it the third proposition which is a consequence of the two preceding i would express thus duty is the necessity of acting from respect for the law i may have inclination for an object as the effect of my proposed action but i can not have respect for it just for this reason that it is an effect and not an energy of will similarly i can not have respect for inclination whether my own or anothers i can at most if my own approve it if anothers sometimes even love it i e look on it as favourable to my own interest it is only what is connected with my will as a principle by no means as an effect—what does not subserve my inclination but overpowers it or at least in case of choice excludes it from its calculation—in other words simply the law of itself which can be an object of respect and hence a command now an action done from duty must wholly exclude the influence of inclination and with it every object of the will so that nothing remains which can determine the will except objectively the law and subjectively pure respect for this practical law and consequently the maxim that i should follow this law even to the thwarting of all my inclinations thus the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect expected from it nor in any principle of action which requires to borrow its motive from this expected effect for all these effects—agreeableness of ones condition and even the promotion of the happiness of others—could have been also brought about by other causes so that for this there would have been no need of the will of a rational being whereas it is in this alone that the supreme and unconditional good can be found the preeminent good which we call moral can therefore consist in nothing else than the conception of law in itself which certainly is only possible in a rational being in so far as this conception and not the expected effect determines the will this is a good which is already present in the person who acts accordingly and we have not to wait for it to appear first in the result but what sort of law can that be the conception of which must determine the will even without paying any regard to the effect expected from it in order that this will may be called good absolutely and without qualification as i have deprived the will of every impulse which could arise to it from obedience to any law there remains nothing but the universal conformity of its actions to law in general which alone is to serve the will as a principle i e i am never to act otherwise than so that i could also will that my maxim should become a universal law here now it is the simple conformity to law in general without assuming any particular law applicable to certain actions that serves the will as its principle and must so serve it if duty is not to be a vain delusion and a chimerical notion the common reason of men in its practical judgments perfectly coincides with this and always has in view the principle here suggested let the question be for example may i when in distress make a promise with the intention not to keep it i readily distinguish here between the two significations which the question may have whether it is prudent or whether it is right to make a false promise the former may undoubtedly often be the case i see clearly indeed that it is not enough
