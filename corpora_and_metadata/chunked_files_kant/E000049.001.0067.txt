nature yet admits of the application to it of a law of freedom and to which we can apply the supersensible idea of the morally good which is to be exhibited in it in concreto thus the judgment of the pure practical reason is subject to the same difficulties as that of the pure theoretical reason the latter however had means at hand of escaping from these difficulties because in regard to the theoretical 0 employment intuitions were required to which pure concepts of the understanding could be applied and such intuitions though only of objects of the senses can be given à priori and therefore as far as regards the union of the manifold in them conforming to the pure à priori concepts of the understanding as schemata on the other hand the morally good is something whose object is supersensible for which therefore nothing corresponding can be found in any sensible intuition judgment depending on laws of pure practical reason seems therefore to be subject to special difficulties arising from this that a law of freedom is to be applied to actions which are events taking place in the world of sense and which so far belong to physical nature but here again is opened a favourable prospect for the pure practical judgment when i subsume under a pure practical law an action possible to me in the world of sense i am not concerned with the possibility of the action as an event in the world of sense this is a matter that belongs to the decision of reason in its theoretic use according to the law of causality which is a pure concept of the understanding for which reason has a schema in the sensible intution physical causality or the condition under which it takes place belongs to the physical concepts the schema of which is sketched by transcendental imagination here however we have to do not with the schema of a case that occurs according to laws but with the schema of a law itself if the word is allowable here since the fact that the will not the action relatively to its effect is determined by the law alone without any other principle connects the notion of causality with quite different conditions from those which constitute physical connexion the physical law being a law to which the objects of sensible intuition as such are subject must have a schema corresponding to it—that is a general procedure of the imagination by which it exhibits à priori to the senses the pure concept of the understanding which the law determines but the law of freedom that is of a causality not subject to sensible conditions and consequently the concept of the unconditionally good can not have any intuition nor consequently any schema supplied to it for the purpose of its application in concreto consequently the moral law has no faculty but the understanding to aid its application to physical objects not the imagination and the understanding for the purposes of the judgment can provide for an idea of the reason not a schema of the sensibility but a law though only as to its form as law such a law however as can be exhibited in concreto in objects of the senses and therefore a law of nature we can therefore call this law the type of the moral law the rule of the judgment according to laws of pure practical reason is this ask yourself whether if the action you propose were to take place by a law of the system of nature of which you were yourself a part you could regard it as possible by your own will everyone does in fact decide by this rule whether actions are morally good or evil thus people say if everyone permitted himself to deceive when he thought it to his advantage or thought himself justified in shortening his life as soon as he was thoroughly weary of it or looked with perfect indifference on the necessity of others and if you belonged to such an order of things would you do so with the assent of your own will now everyone knows well that if he secretly allows himself to deceive it does not follow that everyone else does so or if unobserved he is destitute of compassion others would not necessarily be so to him hence this comparison of the maxim of his actions with a universal law of nature is not the determining principle of his will such a law is nevertheless a type of the estimation of the maxim on moral principles if the maxim of the action is not such as to stand the test of the form of a universal law of nature then it is morally impossible this is the judgment even of common sense for its ordinary judgments even those of experience are always based on the law of nature it has it therefore always at hand only that in cases where causality from freedom is to be criticised it makes that law of nature only the type of a law of freedom because without something which it could use as an example in a case of experience it could not give the law of a pure practical reason its proper use in practice it is therefore allowable to use the system of the world of sense as the type of a supersensible system of things provided i do not transfer to the latter the intuitions and what depends on them but merely apply to it the form of law in general the notion of which occurs even in the commonest use of reason but can not be definitely known à priori for any other purpose than the pure practical use of reason for laws as such are so far identical no matter from what they derive their determining principles further since of all the supersensible absolutely nothing is known except freedom through the moral law and this
