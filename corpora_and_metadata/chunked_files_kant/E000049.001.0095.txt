the whole speculative course of reason was unable to effect the conception of god then is one that belongs originally not to physics i e to speculative reason but to morals the same may be said of the other conceptions of reason of which we have treated above as postulates of it in its practical use in the history of grecian philosophy we find no distinct traces of a pure rational theology earlier than anaxagoras but this is not because the older philosophers had not intelligence or penetration enough to raise themselves to it by the path of speculation at least with the aid of a thoroughly reasonable hypothesis what could have been easier what more natural than the thought which of itself occurs to every one to assume instead of several causes of the world instead of an indeterminate degree of perfection a single rational cause having all perfection but the evils in the world seemed to them to be much too serious objections to allow them to feel themselves justified in such a hypothesis they showed intelligence and penetration then in this very point that they did not allow themselves to adopt it but on the contrary looked about amongst natural causes to see if they could not find in them the qualities and power required for a first being but when this acute people had advanced so far in their investigations of nature as to treat even moral questions philosophically on which other nations had never done anything but talk then first they found a new and practical want which did not fail to give definiteness to their conception of the first being and in this the speculative reason played the part of spectator or at best had the merit of embellishing a conception that had not grown on its own ground and of applying a series of confirmations from the study of nature now brought forward for the first time not indeed to strengthen the authority of this conception which was already established but rather to make a show with a supposed discovery of theoretical reason from these remarks the reader of the critique of pure speculative reason will be thoroughly convinced how highly necessary that laborious deduction of the categories was and how fruitful for theology and morals for if on the one hand we place them in the pure understanding it is by this deduction alone that we can be prevented from regarding them with plato as innate and founding on them extravagant pretensions to theories of the supersensible to which we can see no end and by which we should make theology a magic lantern of chimera on the other hand if we regard them as acquired this deduction saves us from restricting with epicurus all and every use of them even for practical purposes to the objects and motives of the senses but now that the critique has shown by that deduction first that they are not of empirical origin but have their seat and source à priori in the pure understanding secondly that as they refer to objects in general independently on the intuition of them hence although they can not effect theoretical knowledge except in application to empirical objects yet when applied to an object given by pure practical reason they enable us to conceive the supersensible definitely only so far however as it is defined by such predicates as are necessarily connected with the pure practical purpose given à priori and with its possibility the speculative restriction of pure reason and its practical extension bring it into that relation of equality in which reason in general can be employed suitably to its end and this example proves better than any other that the path to wisdom 0 if it is to be made sure and not to be impassable or misleading must with us men inevitably pass through science but it is not till this is completed that we can be convinced that it leads to this goal viii —of belief from a requirement of pure reason a want or requirement of pure reason in its speculative use leads only to a hypothesis that of pure practical reason to a postulate for in the former case i ascend from the result as high as i please in the series of causes not in order to give objective reality to the result e g the causal connexion of things and changes in the world but in order thoroughly to satisfy my inquiring reason in respect of it thus i see before me order and design in nature and need not resort to speculation to assure myself of their reality but to explain them i have to presuppose a deity as their cause and then since the inference from an effect to a definite cause is always uncertain and doubtful especially to a cause so precise and so perfectly defined as we have to conceive in god hence the highest degree of certainty to which this presupposition can be brought is that it is the most rational opinion for us men on the other hand a requirement of pure practical reason is based on a duty that of making something the summum bonum the object of my will so as to promote it with all my powers in which case i must suppose its possibility and consequently also the conditions necessary thereto namely god freedom and immortality since i can not prove these by my speculative reason although neither can i refute them this duty is founded on something that is indeed quite independent on these suppositions and is of itself apodictically certain namely the moral law and so far it needs no further support by theoretical views as to the inner constitution of things the secret final aim of the order of the world or a presiding ruler thereof in order to bind me in the most perfect manner to act in unconditional conformity to the law but the subjective
