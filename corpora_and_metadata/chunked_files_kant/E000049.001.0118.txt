the moral feeling by its own act so that it is an inevitable fact not an obligation and duty when therefore it is said this man has no conscience what is meant is that he pays no heed to its dictates for if he really had none he would not take credit to himself for anything done according to duty nor reproach himself with violation of duty and therefore he would be unable even to conceive the duty of having a conscience i pass by the manifold subdivisions of conscience and only observe what follows from what has just been said namely that there is no such thing as an erring conscience no doubt it is possible sometimes to err in the objective judgment whether something is a duty or not but i can not err in the subjective whether i have compared it with my practical here judicially acting reason for the purpose of that judgment for if i erred i would not have exercised practical judgment at all and in that case there is neither truth nor error unconscientiousness is not want of conscience but the propensity not to heed its judgment but when a man is conscious of having acted according to his conscience then as far as regards guilt or innocence nothing more can be required of him only he is bound to enlighten his understanding as to what is duty or not but when it comes or has come to action then conscience speaks involuntarily and inevitably to act conscientiously can therefore not be a duty since otherwise it would be necessary to have a second conscience in order to be conscious of the act of the first the duty here is only to cultivate our conscience to quicken our attention to the voice of the internal judge and to use all means to secure obedience to it and is thus our indirect duty c —of love to men love is a matter of feeling not of will or volition and i can not love because i will to do so still less because i ought i can not be necessitated to love hence there is no such thing as a duty to love benevolence however amor benevolentiæ as a mode of action may be subject to a law of duty disinterested benevolence is often called though very improperly love even where the happiness of the other is not concerned but the complete and free surrender of all ones own ends to the ends of another even a superhuman being love is spoken of as being also our duty but all duty is necessitation or constraint although it may be selfconstraint according to a law but what is done from constraint is not done from love it is a duty to do good to other men according to our power whether we love them or not and this duty loses nothing of its weight although we must make the sad remark that our species alas is not such as to be found particularly worthy of love when we know it more closely hatred of men however is always hateful even though without any active hostility it consists only in complete aversion from mankind the solitary misanthropy for benevolence still remains a duty even towards the manhater whom one can not love but to whom we can show kindness to hate vice in men is neither duty nor against duty but a mere feeling of horror of vice the will having no influence on the feeling 0 nor the feeling on the will beneficence is a duty he who often practises this and sees his beneficent purpose succeed comes at last really to love him whom he has benefited when therefore it is said thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself this does not mean thou shalt first of all love and by means of this love in the next place do him good but do good to thy neighbour and this beneficence will produce in thee the love of men as a settled habit of inclination to beneficence the love of complacency amor complacentiæ would therefore alone be direct this is a pleasure immediately connected with the idea of the existence of an object and to have a duty to this that is to be necessitated to find pleasure in a thing is a contradiction d —of respect respect reverentia is likewise something merely subjective a feeling of a peculiar kind not a judgment about an object which it would be a duty to effect or to advance for if considered as duty it could only be conceived as such by means of the respect which we have for it to have a duty to this therefore would be as much as to say to be bound in duty to have a duty when therefore it is said man has a duty of selfesteem this is improperly stated and we ought rather to say the law within him inevitably forces from him respect for his own being and this feeling which is of a peculiar kind is a basis of certain duties that is of certain actions which may be consistent with his duty to himself but we can not say that he has a duty of respect for himself for he must have respect for the law within himself in order to be able to conceive duty at all xiii —general principles of the metaphysic of morals in the treatment of pure ethics first a duty can have only a single ground of obligation and if two or more proofs of it are adduced this is a certain mark that either no valid proof has yet been given or that there are several distinct duties which have been regarded as one for all moral proofs being philosophical can only be drawn by means of rational knowledge from concepts not like mathematics through the construction of concepts the latter science admits a variety of proofs
