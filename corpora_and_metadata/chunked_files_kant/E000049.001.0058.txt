place only by means of empirical ideas as principles of determination or whether pure reason can be practical and be the law of a possible order of nature which is not empirically knowable the possibility of such a supersensible system of nature the conception of which can also be the ground of its reality through our own free will does not require any à priori intuition of an intelligible world which being in this case supersensible would be impossible for us for the question is only as to the determining principle of volition in its maxims namely whether it is empirical or is a conception of the pure reason having the legal character belonging to it in general and how it can be the latter it is left to the theoretic principles of reason to decide whether the causality of the will suffices for the realization of the objects or not this being an inquiry into the possibility of the objects of the volition intuition of these objects is therefore of no importance to the practical problem we are here concerned only with the determination of the will and the determining principles of its maxims as a free will not at all with the result for provided only that the will conforms to the law of pure reason then let its power in execution be what it may whether according to these maxims of legislation of a possible system of nature any such system really results or not this is no concern of the critique which only inquires whether and in what way pure reason can be practical that is directly determine the will in this inquiry criticism may and must begin with pure practical laws and their reality but instead of intuition it takes as their foundation the conception of their existence in the intelligible world namely the concept of freedom for this concept has no other meaning and these laws are only possible in relation to freedom of the will but freedom being supposed they are necessary or conversely freedom is necessary because those laws are necessary being practical postulates it can not be further explained how this consciousness of the moral law or what is the same thing of freedom is possible but that it is admissible is well established in the theoretical critique the exposition of the supreme principle of practical reason is now finished that is to say it has been shown first what it contains that it subsists for itself quite à priori and independent on empirical principles and next in what it is distinguished from all other practical principles with the deduction that is the justification of its objective and universal validity and the discernment of the possibility of such a synthetical proposition à priori we can not expect to succeed so well as in the case of the principles of pure theoretical reason for these referred to objects of possible experience namely to phenomena and we could prove that these phenomena could be known as objects of experience only by being brought under the categories in accordance with these laws and consequently that all possible experience must conform to these laws but i could not proceed in this way with the deduction of the moral law for this does not concern the knowledge of the properties of objects which may be given to the reason from some other source but a knowledge which can itself be the ground of the existence of the objects and by which reason in a rational being has causality i e pure reason which can be regarded as a faculty immediately determining the will now all our human insight is at an end as soon as we have arrived at fundamental powers or faculties for the possibility of these can not be understood by any means and just as little should it be arbitrarily invented and assumed therefore in the theoretic use of reason it is experience alone that can justify us in assuming them but this expedient of adducing empirical proofs instead of a deduction from à priori sources of knowledge is denied us here in respect to the pure practical faculty of reason for whatever requires to draw the proof of its reality from experience must depend for the grounds of its possibility on principles of experience and pure yet practical reason by its very notion can not be regarded as such further the moral law is given as a fact of pure reason of which we are à priori conscious and which is apodictically certain though it be granted that in experience no example of its exact fulfilment can be found hence the objective reality of the moral law can not be proved by any deduction by any efforts of theoretical reason whether speculative or empirically supported and therefore even if we renounced its apodictic certainty it could not be proved à posteriori by experience and yet it is firmly established of itself but instead of this vainly sought deduction of the moral principle something else is found which was quite unexpected namely that this moral principle serves conversely as the principle of the deduction of an inscrutable faculty which no experience could prove but of which speculative reason was compelled at least to assume the possibility in order to find amongst its cosmological ideas the unconditioned in the chain of causality so as not to contradict itself—i mean the faculty of freedom the moral law which itself does not require a justification proves not merely the possibility of freedom but that it really belongs to beings who recognise this law as binding on themselves the moral law is in fact a law of the causality of free agents and therefore of the possibility of a supersensible system of nature just as the metaphysical law of events in the world of sense was a law of causality of the sensible system of nature and it therefore determines what speculative philosophy was compelled to leave
