moral wellbeing of others salus moralis also belongs to the happiness of others which it is our duty to promote but only a negative duty the pain that a man feels from remorse of conscience although its origin is moral is yet in its operation physical like grief fear and every other diseased condition to take care that he should not be deservedly smitten by this inward reproach is not indeed my duty but his business nevertheless it is my duty to do nothing which by the nature of man might seduce him to that for which his conscience may hereafter torment him that is it is my duty not to give him occasion of stumbling skandal but there are no definite limits within which this care for the moral satisfaction of others must be kept therefore it involves only an indeterminate obligation 0 ix —what is a duty of virtue virtue is the strength of the mans maxim in his obedience to duty all strength is known only by the obstacles that it can overcome and in the case of virtue the obstacles are the natural inclinations which may come into conflict with the moral purpose and as it is the man who himself puts these obstacles in the way of his maxims hence virtue is not merely a selfconstraint for that might be an effort of one inclination to constrain another but is also a constraint according to a principle of inward freedom and therefore by the mere idea of duty according to its formal law all duties involve a notion of necessitation by the law and ethical duties involve a necessitation for which only an internal legislation is possible juridical duties on the other hand one for which external legislation also is possible both therefore include the notion of constraint either selfconstraint or constraint by others the moral power of the former is virtue and the action springing from such a disposition from reverence for the law may be called a virtuous action ethical although the law expresses a juridical duty for it is the doctrine of virtue that commands us to regard the rights of men as holy but it does not follow that everything the doing of which is virtue is properly speaking a duty of virtue the former may concern merely the form of the maxims the latter applies to the matter of them namely to an end which is also conceived as duty now as the ethical obligation to ends of which there may be many is only indeterminate because it contains only a law for the maxim of actions and the end is the matter object of elective will hence there are many duties differing 0 according to the difference of lawful ends which may be called duties of virtue officia honestatis just because they are subject only to free selfconstraint not to the constraint of other men and determine the end which is also a duty virtue being a coincidence of the rational will with every duty firmly settled in the character is like everything formal only one and the same but as regards the end of actions which is also duty that is as regards the matter which one ought to make an end there may be several virtues and as the obligation to its maxim is called a duty of virtue it follows that there are also several duties of virtue the supreme principle of ethics the doctrine of virtue is act on a maxim the ends of which are such as it might be a universal law for everyone to have on this principle a man is an end to himself as well as others and it is not enough that he is not permitted to use either himself or others merely as means which would imply that he might be indifferent to them but it is in itself a duty of every man to make mankind in general his end this principle of ethics being a categorical imperative does not admit of proof but it admits of a justification deduction from principles of pure practical reason whatever in relation to mankind to ones self and others can be an end that is an end for pure practical reason for this is a faculty of assigning ends in general and to be indifferent to them that is to take no interest in them is a contradiction since in that case it would not determine the maxims of actions which always involve an end and consequently would cease to be practical reason pure reason however can not command any ends à priori except so far as it declares the same to be also a duty which duty is then called a duty of virtue 0 x —the supreme principle of jurisprudence was analytical that of ethics is synthetical that external constraint so far as it withstands that which hinders the external freedom that agrees with general laws is an obstacle of the obstacle thereto can be consistent with ends generally is clear on the principle of contradiction and i need not go beyond the notion of freedom in order to see it let the end which each may be what he will accordingly the supreme principle of jurisprudence is an analytical principle on the contrary the principle of ethics goes beyond the notion of external freedom and by general laws connects further with it an end which it makes a duty this principle therefore is synthetic the possibility of it is contained in the deduction § ix this enlargement of the notion of duty beyond that of external freedom and of its limitation by the merely formal condition of its constant harmony this i say in which instead of constraint from without there is set up freedom within the power of selfconstraint and that not by the help of other inclinations but by pure practical reason which scorns all such help consists in this fact which raises it above
