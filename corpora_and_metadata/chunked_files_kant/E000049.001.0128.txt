human nature origin primary is the derivation of an effect from its primary cause that is one which is not in its turn an effect of another cause of the same kind it may be considered either as a rational or a temporal origin in the former signification it is only the existence of the effect that is considered in the latter its occurrence so that it is referred as an event to its cause in time when the effect is referred to a cause which is connected with it by laws of freedom as is the case with moral evil then the determination of the elective will to the production of it is not regarded as connected with its determining principle in time but merely in the conception of the reason and can not be deduced as from any antecedent state which on the other hand must be done when the bad action considered as an event in the world is referred to its physical cause it is a contradiction then to seek for the timeorigin of free actions as such as we do with physical effects or of the moral character of man so far as it is regarded as contingent because this is the principle of the use of freedom and this as well as the determining principle of free will generally must be sought for simply in conceptions of reason but whatever may be the origin of the moral evil in man the most unsuitable of all views that can be taken of its spread and continuance through all the members of our race and in all generations is to represent it as coming to us by inheritance from our first parents for we can say of moral evil what the poet says of good genus et proavos et quæ non fecimus ipsi vix ea nostro puto it is to be observed further that when we inquire into the origin of evil we do not at first take into account the propensity to it as peccatum in potentia but only consider the actual evil of given actions in its inner possibility and in what must concur to determine the will to the doing of them every bad action when we inquire into its rational origin must be viewed as if the man had fallen into it directly from the state of innocence for whatever may have been his previous conduct and of whatever kind the natural causes influencing him may be whether moreover they are internal or external his action is still free and not determined by any causes and therefore it both can and must be always judged as an original exercise of his elective will he ought to have left it undone in whatever circumstances he may have been for by no cause in the world can he cease to be a freely acting being it is said indeed and justly that the man is accountable for the consequences of his previous free but wrong actions but by this is only meant that one need not have recourse to the subterfuge of deciding whether the later actions are free or not because there is sufficient ground for the accountability in the admittedly free action which was their cause but if a man had been never so bad up to the very moment of an impending free action even so that custom had become second nature yet not only has it been his duty to be better but it is now still his duty to improve himself he must then be also able to do so and if he does not he is just as accountable at the moment of acting as if endowed with the natural capacity for good which is inseparable from freedom he had stepped into evil from the state of innocence we must not inquire then what is the origin in time of this act but what is its origin in reason in order to define thereby the propensity that is to say the general subjective principle by which a transgression is adopted into our maxim if there is such a propensity and if possible to explain it with this agrees very well the mode of representation which the scriptures employ in depicting the origin of evil as a beginning of it in the human race inasmuch as they exhibit it in a history in which that which must be conceived as first in the nature of the thing without regard to the condition of time appears as first in time according to the scriptures evil does not begin from a fundamental propensity to it—otherwise its beginning would not spring from freedom—but from sin by which is understood the transgression of the moral law as a divine command while the state of man before all propensity to evil is called the state of innocence the moral law preceded as a prohibition as must be the case with man as a being not pure but tempted by inclinations gen ii instead now of following this law directly as an adequate spring one which alone is unconditionally good and in respect of which no scruple can occur the man looked about for other springs iii which could only be conditionally good namely so far as the law is not prejudiced thereby and made it his maxim—if we conceive the action as consciously arising from freedom—to obey the law of duty not from duty but from regard to other considerations hence he began with questioning the strictness of the law which excludes the influence of every other spring then he reasoned down obedience to it to the 0 mere conditional conformity to means subject to the principle of selflove whence finally the predominance of sensible motives above the spring of the law was adopted into the maxim of action and so sin was committed iii mutato nomine de te fabula narratur that we all do just the same consequently have all sinned in adam
