of experience of those supreme universal laws of a physical system generally so also a metaphysic of morals can not dispense with similar principles and we shall often have to take the special nature of man which can only be known by experience as our object in order to exhibit in it the consequences of the universal moral principles but this will not detract from the purity of the latter nor cast any doubt on their à priori origin—that is to say a metaphysic of morals can not be founded on anthropology but may be applied to it the counterpart of a metaphysic of morals namely the second subdivision of practical philosophy generally would be moral anthropology which would contain the subjective conditions favourable and unfavourable to carrying out the laws of the power in human nature it would treat of the production the propagation and strengthening of moral principles in education school and popular instruction and other like doctrines and precepts based on experience which can not be dispensed with but which must not come before the metaphysic nor be mixed with it for to do so would be to run the risk of eliciting false or at least indulgent moral laws which would represent that as unattainable which has only not been attained because the law has not been discerned and proclaimed in its purity the very thing in which its strength consists or else because men make use of spurious or mixed motives to what is itself good and dutiful and these allow no certain moral principles to remain but this anthropology is not to be used as a standard of judgment nor as a discipline of the mind in its obedience to duty for the precept of duty must be given solely by pure reason à priori now with respect to the division to which that just mentioned is subordinate namely the division of philosophy into theoretical and practical i have explained myself sufficiently elsewhere in the critical examination of the faculty of judgment and have shown that the latter branch can be nothing else than moral philosophy everything practical which concerns what is possible according to physical laws the proper business of art depends for its precept on the theory of physical nature that only which is practical in accordance with laws of freedom can have principles that do not depend on any theory for there can be no theory of that which transcends the properties of physical nature hence by the practical part of philosophy coordinate with its theoretical part we are to understand not any technical doctrine but a morally practical doctrine and if the habit of choice according to laws of freedom in contrast to physical laws is here also to be called art we must understand thereby such an art as would make a system of freedom like a system of nature possible truly a divine art were we in a condition to fulfil by means of reason the precepts of reason and to carry its ideal into actuality iii of the subdivision of a metaphysic of morals all legislation whether it prescribes internal or external actions and these either à priori by pure reason or by the will of another involves two things first a law which objectively presents the action that is to be done as necessary i e makes it a duty secondly a spring which subjectively connects with the idea of the law the motive determining the elective will to this action hence the second element is this that the law makes duty the spring by the former the action is presented as duty and this is a mere theoretical knowledge of the possible determination of the elective will i e of practical rules by the latter the obligation so to act is connected with a motive which determines the elective will generally in the agent accordingly all legislation may be divided into two classes in respect of the springs employed and this whether the actions prescribed are the same or not as for instance the actions might be in all cases external that legislation which at once makes an action a duty and makes this duty the spring is ethical that which does not include the latter in the law and therefore admits a spring different from the idea of duty itself is juridical as regards the latter it is easily seen that this spring which is distinct from the idea of duty must be derived from the pathological motives of choice namely the inclinations and aversions and amongst these from the latter since it is a legislation which must be constraining not an invitation which is persuasive the mere agreement or disagreement of an action with the law without regard to the motive from which the action springs is called legality but when the idea of duty arising from the law is also the motive of the action the agreement is called the morality of the action duties arising from forensic legislation can only be external duties because this legislation does not require that the idea of this duty which is internal shall be of itself the motive of the elective will of the agent and as it nevertheless requires a suitable spring it can only connect external springs with the law on the other hand ethical legislation while it makes internal actions duties does not exclude external actions but applies generally to everything that is duty but just because ethical legislation includes in its law the inner spring of the action the idea of duty a property which can not belong to the external legislation hence ethical legislation can not be external not even that of a divine will although it may adopt duties which rest on external legislation and take them regarded as duties into its own legislation as springs of action 0 from hence we may see that all duties belong to ethics simply because they are duties but it does not
