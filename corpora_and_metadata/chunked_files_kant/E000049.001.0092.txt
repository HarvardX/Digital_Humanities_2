in such an intelligible world by the supposition of the supreme independent good that is the existence of god thus the fact that respect for the moral law necessarily makes the summum bonum an object of our endeavours and the supposition thence resulting of its objective reality lead through the postulates of practical reason to conceptions which speculative reason might indeed present as problems but could never solve thus it leads— to that one in the solution of which the latter could do nothing but commit paralogisms namely that of immortality because it could not lay hold of the character of permanence by which to complete the psychological conception of an ultimate subject necessarily ascribed to the soul in selfconsciousness so as to make it the real conception of a substance a character which practical reason furnishes by the postulate of a duration required for accordance with the moral law in the summum bonum which is the whole end of practical reason it leads to that of which speculative reason contained nothing but antinomy the solution of which it could only found on a notion problematically conceivable indeed but whose objective reality it could not prove or determine namely the cosmological idea of an intelligible world and the consciousness of our existence in it by means of the postulate of freedom the reality of which it lays down by virtue of the moral law and with it likewise the law of an intelligible world to which speculative reason could only point but could not define its conception what speculative reason was able to think but was obliged to leave undetermined as a mere transcendental ideal viz the theological conception of the first being to this it gives significance in a practical view that is as a condition of the possibility of the object of a will determined by that law namely as the supreme principle of the summum bonum in an intelligible world by means of moral legislation in it invested with sovereign power is our knowledge however actually extended in this way by pure practical reason and is that immanent in practical reason which for the speculative was only transcendent certainly but only in a practical point of view for we do not thereby take knowledge of the nature of our souls nor of the intelligible world nor of the supreme being with respect to what they are in themselves but we have merely combined the conceptions of them in the practical concept of the summum bonum as the object of our will and this altogether à priori but only by means of the moral law and merely in reference to it in respect of the object which it commands but how freedom is possible and how we are to conceive this kind of causality theoretically and positively is not thereby discovered but only that there is such a causality is postulated by the moral law and in its behoof it is the same with the remaining ideas the possibility of which no human intelligence will ever fathom but the truth of which on the other hand no sophistry will ever wrest from the conviction even of the commonest man vii —how is it possible to conceive an extension of pure reason in a practical point of view without its knowledge as speculative being enlarged at the same time in order not to be too abstract we will answer this question at once in its application to the present case in order to extend a pure cognition practically there must be an à priori purpose given that is an end as object of the will which independently on all theological principle is presented as practically necessary by an imperative which determines the will directly a categorical imperative and in this case that is the summum bonum this however is not possible without presupposing three theoretical conceptions for which because they are mere conceptions of pure reason no corresponding intuition can be found nor consequently by the path of theory any objective reality namely freedom immortality and god thus by the practical law which commands the existence of the highest good possible in a world the possibility of those objects of pure speculative reason is postulated and the objective reality which the latter could not assure them by this the theoretical knowledge of pure reason does indeed obtain an accession but it consists only in this that those concepts which otherwise it had to look upon as problematical merely thinkable concepts are now shown assertorially to be such as actually have objects because practical reason indispensably requires their existence for the possibility of its object the summum bonum which practically is absolutely necessary and this justifies theoretical reason in assuming them but this extension of theoretical reason is no extension of speculative that is we can not make any positive use of it in a theoretical point of view for as nothing is accomplished in this by practical reason further than that these concepts are real and actually have their possible objects and nothing in the way of intuition of them is given thereby which indeed could not be demanded hence the admission of this reality does not render any synthetical proposition possible consequently this discovery does not in the least help us to extend this knowledge of ours in a speculative point of view although it does in respect of the practical employment of pure reason the above three ideas of speculative reason are still in themselves not cognitions they are however transcendent thoughts in which there is nothing impossible now by help of an apodictic practical law being necessary conditions of that which it commands to be made an object they acquire objective reality that is we learn from it that they have objects without being able to point out how the conception of them is related to an object and this too is still not a cognition of these objects for we can not thereby form any
