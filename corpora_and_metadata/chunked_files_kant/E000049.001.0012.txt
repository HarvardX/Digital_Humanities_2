it bears the stamp of universality and authority thus it declares itself impersonal in other words what reason reveals we regard as valid for all beings possessed of intelligence equal or superior to our own hence many ethical writers both ancient and modern have insisted as strongly as kant that the moral law is common to man with all rational creatures and when kant speaks of autonomy this is all that his argument requires accordingly he sometimes speaks of rational creatures as the subjects of reason which is the supreme legislator as regards the sanctions of the moral law which practically to imperfect creatures furnish the motive these consist according to kant in the happiness and misery which are the natural consequences of virtue lvii and vice and he thinks that when they are regarded as natural consequences the dread of the misery will have more effect than if it were thought to be an arbitrary punishment the view into an illimitable future of happiness or misery is sufficient to serve as a motive to the virtuous to continue steadfast in welldoing and to arouse in the vicious the condemning voice of conscience to check his evil course in this kant agrees with cumberland kants argument for immortality is in substance that it is necessary for a continued indefinite approximation to the ideal of the moral law but since as he maintains we have ourselves to blame for not having attained this ideal what right have we to expect such an opportunity having missed the true moment in his argument which led to the existence of a supreme lawgiver he arrived at this fundamental truth by a roundabout way through the conception of the summum bonum but this introduces a quite heterogeneous notion viz that of happiness happiness belongs to a man as a sensible creature and all that he has a right to say is that if practical reason had happiness to confer it would confer it on virtue how much more direct and convincing is the argument suggested by butlers brief words consciousness of a rule or guide of action in creatures who are capable of considering it as given them by their maker not only raises immediately a sense of duty but also a sense of security in following it and of danger in deviating from it a direction of the author of nature given to creatures capable of looking upon it as such is plainly a command from lviii him and a command from him necessarily includes in it at least an implicit promise in case of obedience or threatening in case of disobedience and since his method of government is to reward and punish actions his having annexed to some actions an inseparable sense of good desert and to others of ill this surely amounts to declaring upon whom his punishments shall be inflicted and his rewards bestowed kant sees no mode of reconciling morality with the law of causality except by his distinction of noumena and phenomena when the law of causality is rightly understood there is no inconsistency for the cause which it demands is an efficient cause and the idea of an efficient cause involves the idea of mind it is involved in the idea of matter that it can not originate this kant himself adopts as a first principle in his metaphysics of natural philosophy whereas it is the very idea of mind with will that it does originate lix when we seek the cause of motion we are satisfied when we trace it to a will true we may then ask for the motive but the nature of motive and that of efficient cause are heterogeneous kants view of freedom however does not involve anything of caprice or indeterminateness freedom according to him is not independence on law which we can consciously follow but independence on the physical relation of causality the not being determined by physical or sensible causes on this view the contradiction which to hobbes and others seemed to exist between the conception of freedom and that of the divine foreknowledge would have little weight a short consideration suffices to show that there is a fallacy involved in hobbes argument suppose a being perfectly wise and good and at the same time free then we should only require perfect knowledge of the circumstances of a particular case in order to predict his conduct and that infallibly if he were not free we could not do so and the more nearly a being approaches such perfection the more certainly could we predict his actions if his goodness were perfect but his knowledge imperfect and if we knew how far his knowledge extended we could still predict it would be absurd to say that this would be a contradiction it is worthy of notice that cudworths conception of liberty corresponds closely with that of kant the true liberty of a man as it speaks pure perfection is when by the right use of the faculty of free will together with the assistance of divine grace he is habitually fixed in moral good but when by the abuse of that faculty of free will men come to be lx habitually fixed in evil and sinful inclinations then are they as boëthius well expresses it propriæ libertati captivi—made captive and brought into bondage by their own free will it may have been suggested to both of them by st paul who represents sin as slavery righteousness as freedom kant is by no means happy in his treatment of the corruption of human nature in order to escape the difficulty of reconciling responsibility with the innate corruption on which he so strongly dwells he has recourse as in the case of freedom to the distinction between man noumenon and man phenomenon the innate evil of human nature rests on an inversion of the natural order the legislative will being subordinated to the sensibility but how can this be reconciled with the selfgiven
