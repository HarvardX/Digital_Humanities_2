on the subject and laplace only a few pages kant begins by defending his attempt against the possible objections of those who might regard it as an endeavour to dispense with the necessity for a divine author such persons he says appear to suppose that nature left to its own laws would produce only disorder and that the adaptations we admire indicate the interference of a compelling hand as if nature were a rebellious subject that could be reduced to order only by compulsion or else were an independent principle whose properties are uncaused and which god strives to reduce into the plan of his purposes but answers he if the general laws of matter are themselves a result of supreme wisdom must they not be fitted to carry out its wise design in fact xix we have here a powerful weapon in aid of theism when we trace certain beneficial effects to the regular working of the laws of nature we see that these effects are not produced by chance but that these laws can work in no other way but if the nature of things were independent and necessary what an astounding accident or rather what an impossibility would it not be that they should fit together just as a wise and good choice would have made them fit as this applies to such reasoning in general so it applies also to the present undertaking we shall find that matter had certain laws imposed on it by virtue of which it necessarily produced the finest combinations that there is a god is proved even by this that nature even in chaos could only proceed with regularity and order he proceeds to work out in detail the problem of the formation of the planets out of the originally diffused matter taking into consideration the eccentricities inclinations c of the planets the rings of saturn the satellites the comets it is noticeable that he does not like laplace regard the rings of saturn as an illustration of his theory on account of their large inclination to the ecliptic ° he thought it necessary to assign to them a different origin his hypothesis was that they were produced by emanations from the planet itself and he showed further as laplace afterwards did that the ring must have a movement of rotation and that in consequence of the different velocities belonging to different distances from the planet its stability required that it should consist of several distinct rings this conjecture or rather deduction xx has been verified he also conjectured as a result of his hypothesis regarding the formation of the ring that the great velocity of rotation of particles of the inner ring would be the same as that of the planets equator from this consideration combined with the assumption that the ring conforms to keplers third law he deduced the time of the planets rotation he drew particular attention to this as the first prediction of the kind his deduction however has not been verified saturns time of rotation is nearly double what it ought to be on kants theory another conjecture of his subsequently verified was that there are planets beyond saturn later he conjectured also the existence of a planet between mars and jupiter kant then extends his view to the sidereal system he states that the first to suggest to him that the fixed stars constituted a system was wright of durham kant develops this conception if gravitation is a xxi universal property of matter we can not suppose the suns attractive force limited to our system but if it extends to the nearest fixed star and if the fixed stars like suns exercise a similar force around them then they would sooner or later fall together if not prevented like the planets by a centrifugal force hence we may conclude that all the stars of the firmament have their own orbital motion if we conceive our planetary system multiplied a thousandfold and the several bodies in it to be selfluminous the appearance as seen from the earth would resemble that of the milky way the form of the heaven of the fixed stars then is in great an effect of the same systematic arrangement as our system in little our sun with the other stars are in short the planets of a vaster system which is in fact the milky way there may be many such systems and some of these may appear to us as nebulæ and these being seen obliquely would present an elliptic form the milky way seen from a sufficient distance would appear like one of these elliptic nebulæ but these systems again may be mutually related and constitute together a still more immeasurable system this opens to us a view into the infinite field of creation and gives us a conception of the work of god suitable to the infinity of the great creator if the magnitude of a planetary system in which the earth is as a grain of sand fills our understanding with wonder with what amazement are we seized when we consider the vast multitude of worlds and systems which constitute xxii the milky way and how is this amazement increased again when we learn that all these immeasurable star systems are in their turn only a unit in a number whose limit we know not and which is perhaps as inconceivably great as the former while it is itself the unit of a new combination there is here a veritable abyss of immensity in which all human power of conception is lost the wisdom the goodness the power that are revealed are infinite and in the same degree fruitful and active the plan of its revelation must therefore be equally infinite he ventures upon the conjecture giving his reasons that nature may in course of time be again reduced to chaos and again emerge like a phœnix from its ashes when we contemplate nature in these successive
