it that is here assigned this section then like the first was merely analytical now to prove that morality is no creation of the brain which it can not be if the categorical imperative and with it the autonomy of the will is true and as an à priori principle absolutely necessary this supposes the possibility of a synthetic use of pure practical reason which however we can not venture on without first giving a critical examination of this faculty of reason in the concluding section we shall give the principal outlines of this critical examination as far as is sufficient for our purpose third section transition from the metaphysic of morals to the critique of pure practical reason the concept of freedom is the key that explains the autonomy of the will the will is a kind of causality belonging to living beings in so far as they are rational and freedom would be this property of such causality that it can be efficient independently on foreign causes determining it just as physical necessity is the property that the causality of all irrational beings has of being determined to activity by the influence of foreign causes the preceding definition of freedom is negative and therefore unfruitful for the discovery of its essence but it leads to a positive conception which is so much the more full and fruitful since the conception of causality involves that of laws according to which by something that we call cause something else namely the effect must be produced laid down hence although freedom is not a property of the will depending on physical laws yet it is not for that reason lawless on the contrary it must be a causality acting according to immutable laws but of a peculiar kind otherwise a free will would be an absurdity physical necessity is a heteronomy of the efficient causes for every effect is possible only according to this law that something else determines the efficient cause to exert its causality what else then can freedom of the will be but autonomy that is the property of the will to be a law to itself but the proposition the will is in every action a law to itself only expresses the principle to act on no other maxim than that which can also have as an object itself as a universal law now this is precisely the formula of the categorical imperative and is the principle of morality so that a free will and a will subject to moral laws are one and the same on the hypothesis then of freedom of the will morality together with its principle follows from it by mere analysis of the conception however the latter is still a synthetic proposition viz an absolutely good will is that whose maxim can always include itself regarded as a universal law for this property of its maxim can never be discovered by analysing the conception of an absolutely good will now such synthetic propositions are only possible in this way that the two cognitions are connected together by their union with a third in which they are both to be found the positive concept of freedom furnishes this third cognition which can not as with physical causes be the nature of the sensible world in the concept of which we find conjoined the concept of something in relation as cause to something else as effect we can not now at once show what this third is to which freedom points us and of which we have an idea à priori nor can we make intelligible how the concept of freedom is shown to be legitimate from principles of pure practical reason and with it the possibility of a categorical imperative but some further preparation is required freedom must be presupposed as a property of the will of all rational beings 0 it is not enough to predicate freedom of our own will from whatever reason if we have not sufficient grounds for predicating the same of all rational beings for as morality serves as a law for us only because we are rational beings it must also hold for all rational beings and as it must be deduced simply from the property of freedom it must be shown that freedom also is a property of all rational beings it is not enough then to prove it from certain supposed experiences of human nature which indeed is quite impossible and it can only be shown à priori but we must show that it belongs to the activity of all rational beings endowed with a will now i say every being that can not act except under the idea of freedom is just for that reason in a practical point of view really free that is to say all laws which are inseparably connected with freedom have the same force for him as if his will had been shown to be free in itself by a proof theoretically conclusive now i affirm that we must attribute to every rational being which has a will that it has also the idea of freedom and acts entirely under this idea for in such a being we conceive a reason that is practical that is has causality in reference to its objects now we can not possibly conceive a reason consciously receiving a bias from any other quarter with respect to its judgments for then the subject would ascribe the determination of its judgment not to its own reason but to an impulse it must regard itself as the author of its principles independent on foreign influences consequently as practical reason or as the will of a rational being it must regard itself as free that is to say the will of such a being can not be a will of its own except under the idea of freedom this idea must therefore in a practical point of view be ascribed to every rational being of the interest
