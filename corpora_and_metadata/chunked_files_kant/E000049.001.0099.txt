in moral matters very much and not merely teaches humility but makes everyone feel it when he examines himself closely nevertheless we can for the most part observe in those who defend the purity of purpose in giving examples that where there is the presumption of uprightness 0 they are anxious to remove even the least spot lest if all examples had their truthfulness disputed and if the purity of all human virtue were denied it might in the end be regarded as a mere phantom and so all effort to attain it be made light of as vain affectation and delusive conceit i do not know why the educators of youth have not long since made use of this propensity of reason to enter with pleasure upon the most subtle examination of the practical questions that are thrown up and why they have not after first laying the foundation of a purely moral catechism searched through the biographies of ancient and modern times with the view of having at hand instances of the duties laid down in which especially by comparison of similar actions under different circumstances they might exercise the critical judgment of their scholars in remarking their greater or less moral significance this is a thing in which they would find that even early youth which is still unripe for speculation of other kinds would soon become very acute and not a little interested because it feels the progress of its faculty of judgment and what is most important they could hope with confidence that the frequent practice of knowing and approving good conduct in all its purity and on the other hand of remarking with regret or contempt the least deviation from it although it may be pursued only as a sport in which children may compete with one another yet will leave a lasting impression of esteem on the one hand and disgust on the other and so by the mere habit of looking on such actions as deserving approval or blame a good foundation would be laid for uprightness in the future course of life 0 only i wish they would spare them the example of socalled noble supermeritorious actions in which our sentimental books so much abound and would refer all to duty merely and to the worth that a man can and must give himself in his own eyes by the consciousness of not having transgressed it since whatever runs up into empty wishes and longings after inaccessible perfection produces mere heroes of romance who while they pique themselves on their feeling for transcendent greatness release themselves in return from the observance of common and everyday obligations which then seem to them petty and insignificant but if it is asked what then is really pure morality by which as a touchstone we must test the moral significance of every action then i must admit that it is only philosophers that can make the decision of this question doubtful for to common sense it has been decided long ago not indeed by abstract general formul√¶ but by habitual use like the distinction between the right and left hand we will then point out the criterion of pure virtue in an example first and imagining that it is set before a boy of say ten years old for his judgment we will see whether 0 he would necessarily judge so of himself without being guided by his teacher tell him the history of an honest man whom men want to persuade to join the calumniators of an innocent and powerless person say anne boleyn accused by henry viii of england he is offered advantages great gifts or high rank he rejects them this will excite mere approbation and applause in the mind of the hearer now begins the threatening of loss amongst these traducers are his best friends who now renounce his friendship near kinsfolk who threaten to disinherit him he being without fortune powerful persons who can persecute and harass him in all places and circumstances a prince who threatens him with loss of freedom yea loss of life then to fill the measure of suffering and that he may feel the pain that only the morally good heart can feel very deeply let us conceive his family threatened with extreme distress and want entreating him to yield conceive himself though upright yet with feelings not hard or insensible either to compassion or to his own distress conceive him i say at the moment when he wishes that he had never lived to see the day that exposed him to such unutterable anguish yet remaining true to his uprightness of purpose without wavering or even doubting then will my youthful hearer be raised gradually from mere approval to admiration from that to amazement and finally to the greatest veneration and a lively wish that he himself could be such a man though certainly not in such circumstances yet virtue is here worth so much only because it costs so much not because it brings any profit all the admiration and even the endeavour to resemble this character rest wholly on the purity of the moral principle which can only be strikingly shown 0 by removing from the springs of action everything that men may regard as part of happiness morality then must have the more power over the human heart the more purely it is exhibited whence it follows that if the law of morality and the image of holiness and virtue are to exercise any influence at all on our souls they can do so only so far as they are laid to heart in their purity as motives unmixed with any view to prosperity for it is in suffering that they display themselves most nobly now that whose removal strengthens the effect of a moving force must have been a hindrance consequently every admixture of motives taken from our own happiness is a hindrance to the influence of the moral law
