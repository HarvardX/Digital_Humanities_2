more probably natur is a slip for ursache cause it is commonly held that the christian precept of morality has no advantage in respect of purity over the moral conceptions of the stoics the distinction between them is however very obvious the stoic system made the consciousness of strength of mind the pivot on which all moral dispositions should turn and although its disciples spoke of duties and even defined them very well yet they placed the spring and proper determining principle of the will in an elevation of the mind above the lower springs of the senses which owe their power only to weakness of mind with them therefore virtue was a sort of heroism in the wise man who raising himself above the animal nature of man is sufficient for himself and while he prescribes duties to others is himself raised above them and is not subject to any temptation to transgress the moral law all this however they could not have done if they had conceived this law in all its purity and strictness as the precept of the gospel does when i give the name idea to a perfection to which nothing adequate can be given in experience it does not follow that the moral ideas are something transcendent that is something of which we could not even determine the concept adequately or of which it is uncertain whether there is any object corresponding to it at all 0 as is the case with the ideas of speculative reason on the contrary being types of practical perfection they serve as the indispensable rule of conduct and likewise as the standard of comparison now if i consider christian morals on their philosophical side then compared with the ideas of the greek schools they would appear as follows the ideas of the cynics the epicureans the stoics and the christians are simplicity of nature prudence wisdom and holiness in respect of the way of attaining them the greek schools were distinguished from one another thus that the cynics only required common sense the others the path of science but both found the mere use of natural powers sufficient for the purpose christian morality because its precept is framed as a moral precept must be so pure and unyielding takes from man all confidence that he can be fully adequate to it at least in this life but again sets it up by enabling us to hope that if we act as well as it is in our power to do then what is not in our power will come in to our aid from another source whether we know how this may be or not aristotle and plato differed only as to the origin of our moral conceptions see preface p note the word sanction is here used in the technical german sense which is familiar to students of history in connexion with the pragmatic sanction in order to make these characteristics of these conceptions clear i add the remark that whilst we ascribe to god various attributes the quality of which we also find applicable to creatures only that in him they are raised to the highest degree eg power knowledge presence goodness c under the designations of omnipotence omniscience omnipresence c there are three that are ascribed to god exclusively and yet without the addition of greatness and which are all moral he is the only holy the only blessed the only wise because these conceptions already imply the absence of limitation in the order of these attributes he is also the holy lawgiver and creator the good governor and preserver and the just judge three attributes which include everything by which god is the object of religion and in conformity with which the metaphysical perfections are added of themselves in the reason that the ambiguity of the word subject may not mislead the reader it may be remarked that it is here used in the psychological sense subjectum legis not subjectus legi absent from the original text this remarks as well as the following note applies to the etymological form of the german word which is godlearned learning is properly only the whole content of the historical sciences consequently it is only the teacher of revealed theology that can be called a learned theologian godlearned if however we choose to call a man learned who is in possession of the rational sciences mathematics and philosophy although even this would be contrary to the signification of the word which always counts as learning only that which one must be learned taught and which therefore he can not discover of himself by reason even in that case the philosopher would make too poor a figure with his knowledge of god as a positive science to let himself be called on that account a learned man but even here we should not be able to allege a requirement of reason if we had not before our eyes a problematical but yet inevitable conception of reason namely that of an absolutely necessary being this conception now seeks to be defined and this in addition to the tendency to extend itself is the objective ground of a requirement of speculative reason namely to have a more precise definition of the conception of a necessary being which is to serve as the first cause of other beings so as to make these latter knowable by some means without such antecedent necessary problems there are no requirements—at least not of pure reason—the rest are requirements of inclination i read diese with the ed of rosenkranz and hartenstein both read dieses this being in the deutsches museum february there is a dissertation by a very subtle and clearheaded man the late wizenmann whose early death is to be lamented in which he disputes the right to argue from a want to the objective reality of its object and illustrates the point by the example of a man in love who having fooled himself
