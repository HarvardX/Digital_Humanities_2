follow that their legislation is always included in ethics in the case of many duties it is quite outside ethics thus ethics requires that i should fulfil my pledged word even though the other party could not compel me to do so but the law pacta sunt servanda and the corresponding duty are taken by ethics from jurisprudence accordingly it is not in ethics but in jus that the legislation is contained which enjoins that promises be kept ethics teaches only that even if the spring were absent which is connected by forensic legislation with that duty namely external compulsion yet the idea of duty would alone be sufficient as a spring for if this were not so and if the legislation itself were not forensic and the duty arising from it not properly a legal duty in contrast to a moral duty then faithfulness to ones engagements would be put in the same class as actions of benevolence and the obligation to them which can not be admitted it is not an ethical duty to keep ones promise but a legal duty one that we can be compelled to perform nevertheless it is a virtuous action a proof of virtue to do so even where no compulsion is to be apprehended law and morals therefore are distinguished not so much by the diversity of their duties but rather by the diversity of the legislation which connects this or that motive with the law ethical legislation is that which can not be external although the duties may be external forensic legislation is that which can be external thus to keep ones contract is an external duty but the command to do this merely because it is a duty without regard to any other motive belongs only to the internal legislation accordingly the obligation is reckoned as belonging to ethics not as being a special kind of duty a special kind of actions to which one is bound—for in ethics as well as in law we have external duties—but because in the supposed case the legislation is an internal one and can have no external lawgiver for the same reason duties of benevolence although they are external duties obligations to external actions are yet reckoned as belonging to ethics because the legislation imposing them can only be internal no doubt ethics has also duties peculiar to itself ex gr duties to ourselves but it also has duties in common with law only the kind of obligation is different for it is the peculiarity of ethical legislation to perform actions solely because they are duties and to make the principle of duty itself the adequate spring of the will no matter whence the duty may be derived hence while there are many directly ethical duties the internal legislation makes all others indirectly ethical iv preliminary notions belonging to the metaphysic of morals philosophia practica universalis the concept of freedom is a pure concept of the reason and on this account it is as regards theoretical philosophy transcendent that is a concept for which there is no corresponding example in any possible experience which therefore forms no object of any theoretic knowledge possible to us and is valid not as a constitutive but simply as a regulative principle of pure speculative reason and that a negative one but in the practical exercise of reason it proves its reality by practical principles which being laws of a causality of pure reason determine the elective will independently on all empirical conditions sensible conditions generally and prove the existence of a pure will in us in which the moral concepts and laws have their origin on this concept of freedom which in a practical aspect is positive are founded unconditional practical laws which are called moral and these in respect of us whose elective will is sensibly affected and therefore does not of itself correspond with the pure will but often opposes it are imperatives commands or prohibitions and moreover are categorical unconditional imperatives by which they are distinguished from technical imperatives precepts of art which always give only conditional commands by these imperatives certain actions are permitted or not permitted that is are morally possible or impossible some however or their opposites are morally necessary that is obligatory hence arises the notion of a duty the obeying or transgressing of which is indeed connected with a pleasure or displeasure of a peculiar kind that of a moral feeling of which however we can take no account in the practical laws of reason since they do not concern the foundation of the practical laws but only the subjective effect in the mind when our elective will is determined by these and they may be very different in different persons without adding to or taking from the validity or influence of these laws objectively that is in the judgment of the reason the following notions are common to both parts of the metaphysic of morals— obligation is the necessity of a free action under a categorical imperative of reason the imperative is a practical rule by which an action in itself contingent is made necessary it is distinguished from a practical law by this that while the latter exhibits the necessity of the action it takes no account of the consideration whether this already inheres by an internal necessity in the agent say a holy being or whether as in man it is contingent for where the former is the case there is no imperative accordingly the imperative is a rule the conception of which makes necessary an action that is subjectively contingent and hence represents the subject as one who must be constrained necessitated to agreement with this rule the categorical unconditional imperative is one that does not command indirectly through the idea of an end that can be attained by the action but immediately through the mere conception of this action itself its form thinks it as objectively necessary and makes it necessary no example
