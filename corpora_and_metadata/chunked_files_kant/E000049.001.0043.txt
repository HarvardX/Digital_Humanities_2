itself forced to assume it although without any means of making it comprehensible to itself happy enough if only it can discover a conception which agrees with this assumption it is therefore no fault in our deduction of the supreme principle of morality but an objection that should be made to human reason in general that it can not enable us to conceive the absolute necessity of an unconditional practical law such as the categorical imperative must be it can not be blamed for refusing to explain this necessity by a condition that is to say by means of some interest assumed as a basis since the law would then cease to be a moral law i e a supreme law of freedom and thus while we do not comprehend the practical unconditional necessity of the moral imperative we yet comprehend its incomprehensibility and this is all that can be fairly demanded of a philosophy which strives to carry its principles up to the very limit of human reason critical examination of practical reason preface this work is called the critical examination of practical reason not of the pure practical reason although its parallelism with the speculative critique would seem to require the latter term the reason of this appears sufficiently from the treatise itself its business is to show that there is pure practical reason and for this purpose it criticises the entire practical faculty of reason if it succeeds in this it has no need to criticise the pure faculty itself in order to see whether reason in making such a claim does not presumptuously overstep itself as is the case with the speculative reason for if as pure reason it is actually practical it proves its own reality and that of its concepts by fact and all disputation against the possibility of its being real is futile with this faculty transcendental freedom is also established freedom namely in that absolute sense in which speculative reason required it in its use of the concept of causality in order to escape the antinomy into which it inevitably falls when in the chain of cause and effect it tries to think the unconditioned speculative reason could only exhibit this concept of freedom problematically as not impossible to thought without assuring it any objective reality and merely lest the supposed impossibility of what it must at least allow to be thinkable 0 should endanger its very being and plunge it into an abyss of scepticism inasmuch as the reality of the concept of freedom is proved by an apodictic law of practical reason it is the keystone of the whole system of pure reason even the speculative and all other concepts those of god and immortality which as being mere ideas remain in it unsupported now attach themselves to this concept and by it obtain consistence and objective reality that is to say their possibility is proved by the fact that freedom actually exists for this idea is revealed by the moral law freedom however is the only one of all the ideas of the speculative reason of which we know the possibility à priori without however understanding it because it is the condition of the moral law which we know the ideas of god and immortality however are not conditions of the moral law but only conditions of the necessary object of a will determined by this law that is to say conditions of the practical use of our pure reason hence with respect to these ideas we can not affirm that we know and understand i will not say the actuality but even the possibility of them however they are the conditions of the application of the morally 0 determined will to its object which is given to it à priori viz the summum bonum consequently in this practical point of view their possibility must be assumed although we can not theoretically know and understand it to justify this assumption it is sufficient in a practical point of view that they contain no intrinsio impossibility contradiction here we have what as far as speculative reason is concerned is a merely subjective principle of assent which however is objectively valid for a reason equally pure but practical and this principle by means of the concept of freedom assures objective reality and authority to the ideas of god and immortality nay there is a subjective necessity a need of pure reason to assume them nevertheless the theoretical knowledge of reason is not hereby enlarged but only the possibility is given which heretofore was merely a problem and now becomes assertion and thus the practical use of reason is connected with the elements of theoretical reason and this need is not a merely hypothetical one for the arbitrary purposes of speculation that we must assume something if we wish in speculation to carry reason to its utmost limits but it is a need which has the force of law to assume something without which that can not be which we must inevitably set before us as the aim of our action it would certainly be more satisfactory to our speculative reason if it could solve these problems for itself without this circuit and preserve the solution for practical use as a thing to be referred to but in fact our faculty of speculation is not so well provided those who boast of such high knowledge ought not to keep it back but to exhibit it publicly that it may be tested and appreciated they want to prove very good let them prove and the critical philosophy lays its arms at their feet as the victors quid statis nolint 0 atqui licet esse beatis as they then do not in fact choose to do so probably because 0 they can not we must take up these arms again in order to seek in the mortal use of reason and to base on this the notions of god freedom and immortality the possibility of
