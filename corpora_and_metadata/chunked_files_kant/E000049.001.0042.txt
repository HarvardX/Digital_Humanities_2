never give moral laws but that it interests us because it is valid for us as men inasmuch as it had its source in our will as intelligences in other words in our proper self and what belongs to mere appearance is necessarily subordinated by reason to the nature of the thing in itself the question then how a categorical imperative is possible can be answered to this extent that we can assign the only hypothesis on which it is possible namely the idea of freedom and we can also discern the necessity of this hypothesis and this is sufficient for the practical exercise of reason that is for the conviction of the validity of this imperative and hence of the moral law but how this hypothesis itself is possible can never be discerned by any human reason on the hypothesis however that the will of an intelligence is free its autonomy as the essential formal condition of its determination is a necessary consequence moreover this freedom of will is not merely quite possible as a hypothesis not involving any contradiction to the principle of physical necessity in the connexion of the phenomena of the sensible world as speculative philosophy can show but further a rational being who is conscious of a causality through reason that is to say of a will distinct from desires must of necessity make it practically that is in idea the condition of all his voluntary actions but to explain how pure reason can be of itself practical without the aid of any spring of action that could be derived from any other source i e how the mere principle of the universal validity of all its maxims as laws which would certainly be the form of a pure practical reason can of itself supply a spring without any matter object of the will in which one could antecedently take any interest and how it can produce an interest which would be called purely moral or in other words how pure reason can be practicalâ€”to explain this is beyond the power of human reason and all the labour and pains of seeking an explanation of it are lost it is just the same as if i sought to find out how freedom itself is possible as the causality of a will for then i quit the ground of philosophical explanation and i have no other to go upon i might indeed revel in the world of intelligences which still remains to me but although i have an idea of it which is well founded yet i have not the least knowledge of it nor can i ever attain to such knowledge with all the efforts of my natural faculty of reason it signifies only a something that remains over when i have eliminated everything belonging to the world of sense from the actuating principles of my will serving merely to keep in bounds the principle of motives taken from the field of sensibility fixing its limits and showing that it does not contain all in all within itself but that there is more beyond it but this something more i know no further of pure reason which frames this ideal there remains after the abstraction of all matter i e knowledge of objects nothing but the form namely the practical law of the universality of the maxims and in conformity with this the conception of reason in reference to a pure world of understanding as a possible efficient cause that is a cause determining the will there must here be a total absence of springs unless this idea of an intelligible world is itself the spring or that in which reason primarily takes an interest but to make this intelligible is precisely the problem that we can not solve here now is the extreme limit of all moral inquiry and it is of great importance to determine it even on this account in order that reason may not on the one hand to the prejudice of morals seek about in the world of sense for the supreme motive and an interest comprehensible but empirical and on the other hand that it may not impotently flap its wings without being able to move in the for it empty space of transcendent concepts which we call the intelligible world and so lose itself amidst chimeras for the rest the idea of a pure world of understanding as a system of all intelligences and to which we ourselves as rational beings belong although we are likewise on the other side members of the sensible world this remains always a useful and legitimate idea for the purposes of rational belief although all knowledge stops at its threshold useful namely to produce in us a lively interest in the moral law by means of the noble ideal of a universal kingdom of ends in themselves rational beings to which we can belong as members then only when we carefully conduct ourselves according to the maxims of freedom as if they were laws of nature concluding remark the speculative employment of reason with respect to nature leads to the absolute necessity of some supreme cause of the world the practical employment of reason with a view to freedom leads also to absolute necessity but only of the laws of the actions of a rational being as such now it is an essential principle of reason however employed to push its knowledge to a consciousness of its necessity without which it would not be rational knowledge it is however an equally essential restriction of the same reason that it can neither discern the necessity 00 of what is or what happens nor of what ought to happen unless a condition is supposed on which it is or happens or ought to happen in this way however by the constant inquiry for the condition the satisfaction of reason is only further and further postponed hence it unceasingly seeks the unconditionally necessary and finds
