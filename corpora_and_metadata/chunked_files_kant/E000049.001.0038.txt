we show our own activity then it follows of itself that we must admit and assume behind the appearance something else that is not an appearance namely the things in themselves although we must admit that as they can never be known to us except as they affect us we can come no nearer to them nor can we ever know what they are in themselves this must furnish a distinction however crude between a world of sense and the world of understanding of which the former may be different according to the difference of the sensuous impressions in various observers while the second which is its basis always remains the same even as to himself a man can not pretend to know what he is in himself from the knowledge he has by internal sensation for as he does not as it were create himself and does not come by the conception of himself Ã  priori but empirically it naturally follows that he can obtain his knowledge even of himself only by the inner sense and consequently only through the appearances of his nature and the way in which his consciousness is affected at the same time beyond these characteristics of his own subject made up of mere appearances he must necessarily suppose something else as their basis namely his ego whatever its characteristics in itself may be thus in respect to mere perception and receptivity of sensations he must reckon himself as belonging to the world of sense but in respect of whatever there may be of pure activity in him that which reaches consciousness immediately and not through affecting the senses he must reckon himself as belonging to the intellectual world of which however he has no further knowledge to such a conclusion the reflecting man must come with respect to all the things which can be presented to him it is probably to be met with even in persons of the commonest understanding who as is well known are very much inclined to suppose behind the objects of the senses something else invisible and acting of itself they spoil it however by presently sensualizing this invisible again that is to say wanting to make it an object of intuition so that they do not become a whit the wiser now man really finds in himself a faculty by which he distinguishes himself from everything else even from himself as affected by objects and that is reason this being pure spontaneity is even elevated above the understanding for although the latter is a spontaneity and does not like sense merely contain intuitions that arise when we are affected by things and are therefore passive yet it can not produce from its activity any other conceptions than those which merely serve to bring the intuitions of sense under rules and thereby to unite them in one consciousness and without this use of the sensibility it could not think at all whereas on the contrary reason shows so pure a spontaneity in the case of what i call ideas ideal conceptions that it thereby far transcends everything that the sensibility can give it and exhibits its most important function in distinguishing the world of sense from that of understanding and thereby prescribing the limits of the understanding itself for this reason a rational being must regard himself qua intelligence not from the side of his lower faculties as belonging not to the world of sense but to that of understanding hence he has two points of view from which he can regard himself and recognise laws of the exercise of his faculties and consequently of all his actions first so far as he belongs to the world of sense he finds himself subject to laws of nature heteronomy secondly as belonging to the intelligible world under laws which being independent on nature have their foundation not in experience but in reason alone as a rational being and consequently belonging to the intelligible world man can never conceive the causality of his own will otherwise than on condition of the idea of freedom for independence on the determining causes of the sensible world an independence which reason must always ascribe to itself is freedom now the idea of freedom is inseparably connected with the conception of autonomy and this again with the universal principle of morality which is ideally the foundation of all actions of rational beings just as the law of nature is of all phenomena now the suspicion is removed which we raised above that there was a latent circle involved in our reasoning from freedom to autonomy and from this to the moral law viz that we laid down the idea of freedom because of the moral law only that we might afterwards in turn infer the latter from freedom and that consequently we could assign no reason at all for this law but could only present it as a petitio principii which well disposed minds would gladly concede to us but which we could never put forward as a provable proposition for now we see that when we conceive ourselves as free we transfer ourselves into the world of understanding as members of it and recognise the autonomy of the will with its consequence morality whereas if we conceive ourselves as under obligation we consider ourselves as belonging to the world of sense and at the same time to the world of understanding how is a categorical imperative possible every rational being reckons himself qua intelligence as belonging to the world of understanding and it is simply as an efficient cause belonging to that world that he calls his causality a will on the other side he is also conscious of himself as a part of the world of sense in which his actions which are mere appearances phenomena of that causality are displayed we can not however discern how they are possible from this causality which we do not know but instead of that these
