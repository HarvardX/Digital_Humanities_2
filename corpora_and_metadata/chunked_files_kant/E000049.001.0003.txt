changes carrying out the plan by which god reveals himself in wonders that fill space and eternity the mind is overwhelmed with astonishment but not satisfied with this vast yet perishable object the soul desires to know more nearly that being whose intelligence and whose greatness are the source of that light which spreads as from a centre over all nature with what awe must not the soul regard even its own nature when it reflects that it shall outlive all these changes o happy he exclaims when amid the tumult of the elements and the ruin of nature it is placed on a height from whence it can as it were see beneath its feet the desolation of all perishable things xxiii of the world reason could not even dare to wish for such happiness but revelation teaches us to hope for it with confidence when the fetters that have bound us to the vanity of the creature have fallen off the immortal spirit will find itself in the enjoyment of true happiness in communion with the infinite being the contemplation of the harmony of universal nature with the will of god must fill with everincreasing satisfaction the rational creature who finds himself united to this source of all perfection viewed from this centre nature will show on all sides nothing but stability and fitness its changes can not interfere with the happiness of a creature who has reached this height in sweet foretaste of this condition the soul can exercise its mouth in those songs of praise with which all eternity shall ringâ€” when nature fails and day and night divide thy works no more my evergrateful heart o lord thy mercy shall adore through all eternity to thee a joyful song ill raise for oh eternitys too short to utter all thy praise addison discussing the question whether the planets are inhabited he states his opinion that it would be absurd to deny this as to all or even most of them but in the wealth of nature in which worlds and systems are to the whole creation only sundust there may well be xxiv waste and uninhabited places as there are uninhabited waste on our own earth perhaps indeed he adds some of the planets are not yet brought into a state fit for habitation it may take thousands of years to bring the matter of a great planet into a steady condition jupiter appears to be in this transition state one planet may come to its perfection thousands of years later than another we may be sure that most of the planets are inhabited and those that are not will be so in due time he imagines that the further the planets are from the sun the more the inhabitants excel in liveliness and distinctness of thought indulging in fancy he asks does sin exist in those worlds and suggests that perhaps the beings in the inferior planets may be too low to be responsible those in the superior planets too wise and too elevated to fall into sin with the exception perhaps of mars perhaps he adds some of these bodies may be preparing for our future habitation who knows whether the satellites which revolve round jupiter are destined one day to illumine us no one however will base his hopes of the future on such uncertain fancies when corruption has claimed its part in human nature then shall the immortal spirit swiftly soar above all that is finite and continue its existence in a new relation to the whole of nature arising from its nearer relation to the supreme being when we gaze on the starry heavens with our mind filled with such thoughts as have here been expressed while all nature is at rest and our senses also in repose the hidden faculties of xxv the immortal soul speak in a language unutterable and give us conceptions which can be felt but not described if there are on this planet thinking beings so base as to bind themselves to the service of corruption in spite of all that draws them away from it how unhappy is this globe to produce such miserable creatures but how happy on the other hand that under conditions worthy of all acceptation a way is opened to them to attain to a happiness and a dignity infinitely beyond all the advantages which the most favourable arrangements of nature can reach in all the bodies of the universe the reader who is interested in kant himself will readily pardon this long notice of a work to which he attached some importance at its first publication it was dedicated to the king frederick the great and the theory developed in it is frequently referred to by kant in his subsequent writings for he never ceased to take an interest in these subjects so late as he wrote an essay on the volcanoes in the moon with reference to an observation of herschel in this paper he suggests a mode of accounting for the great heat of the sun and originally of the planets his suggestion is based on the discovery of crawford that heat is developed by condensation on the hypothesis then that the sun and planets were formed by the condensation of matter originally diffused through the whole xxvi space this heat would be a direct consequence of the condensation still later in writing on the influence of the moon on the weather he throws out the suggestion that the moons centre of gravity may for reasons which he gives lie beyond its centre of figure a consequence of which would be that any air and water which might be upon its surface would be collected at the side remote from us in another instance both kant and laplace might have had reason to say pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt in kant wrote a short paper on the theory of the winds in which for the first
