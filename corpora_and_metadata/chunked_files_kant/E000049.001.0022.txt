may sometimes doubt whether true virtue is actually found anywhere in the world and this especially as years increase and the judgment is partly made wiser by experience and partly also more acute in observation this being so nothing can secure us from falling away altogether from our ideas of duty or maintain in the soul a wellgrounded respect for its law but the clear conviction that although there should never have been actions which really sprang from such pure sources yet whether this or that takes place is not at all the question but that reason of itself independent on all experience ordains what ought to take place that accordingly actions of which perhaps the world has hitherto never given an example the feasibility even of which might be very much doubted by one who founds everything on experience are nevertheless inflexibly commanded by reason that ex gr even though there might never yet have been a sincere friend yet not a whit the less is pure sincerity in friendship required of every man because prior to all experience this duty is involved as duty in the idea of a reason determining the will by à priori principles when we add further that unless we deny that the notion of morality has any truth or reference to any possible object we must admit that its law must be valid not merely for men but for all rational creatures generally not merely under certain contingent conditions or with exceptions but with absolute necessity then it is clear that no experience could enable us to infer even the possibility of such apodictic laws for with what right could we bring into unbounded respect as a universal precept for every rational nature that which perhaps holds only under the contingent conditions of humanity or how could laws of the determination of our will be regarded as laws of the determination of the will of rational beings generally and for us only as such if they were merely empirical and did not take their origin wholly à priori from pure but practical reason nor could anything be more fatal to morality than that we should wish to derive it from examples for every example of it that is set before me must be first itself tested by principles of morality whether it is worthy to serve as an original example i e as a pattern but by no means can it authoritatively furnish the conception of morality even the holy one of the gospels must first be compared with our ideal of moral perfection before we can recognise him as such and so he says of himself why call ye me whom you see good none is good the model of good but god only whom ye do not see but whence have we the conception of god as the supreme good simply from the idea of moral perfection which reason frames à priori and connects inseparably with the notion of a freewill imitation finds no place at all in morality and examples serve only for encouragement i e they put beyond doubt the feasibility of what the law commands they make visible that which the practical rule expresses more generally but they can never authorize us to set aside the true original which lies in reason and to guide ourselves by examples if then there is no genuine supreme principle of morality but what must rest simply on pure reason independent on all experience i think it is not necessary even to put the question whether it is good to exhibit these concepts in their generality in abstracto as they are established à priori along with the principles belonging to them if our knowledge is to be distinguished from the vulgar and to be called philosophical in our times indeed this might perhaps be necessary for if we collected votes whether pure rational knowledge separated from everything empirical that is to say metaphysic of morals or whether popular practical philosophy is to be preferred it is easy to guess which side would preponderate this descending to popular notions is certainly very commendable if the ascent to the principles of pure reason has first taken place and been satisfactorily accomplished this implies that we first found ethics on metaphysics and then when it is firmly established procure a hearing for it by giving it a popular character but it is quite absurd to try to be popular in the first inquiry on which the soundness of the principles depends it is not only that this proceeding can never lay claim to the very rare merit of a true philosophical popularity since there is no art in being intelligible if one renounces all thoroughness of insight but also it produces a disgusting medley of compiled observations and halfreasoned principles shallow pates enjoy this because it can be used for everyday chat but the sagacious find in it only confusion and being unsatisfied and unable to help themselves they turn away their eyes while philosophers who see quite well through this delusion are little listened to when they call men off for a time from this pretended popularity in order that they might be rightfully popular after they have attained a definite insight we need only look at the attempts of moralists in that favourite fashion and we shall find at one time the special constitution of human nature including however the idea of a rational nature generally at one time perfection at another happiness here moral sense there fear of god a little of this and a little of that in marvellous mixture without its occurring to them to ask whether the principles of morality are to be sought in the knowledge of human nature at all which we can have only from experience and if this is not so if these principles are to be found altogether à priori free from everything empirical in pure rational concepts only and nowhere else not even
