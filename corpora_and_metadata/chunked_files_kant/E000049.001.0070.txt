of the subject and produces a feeling conducive to the influence of the law on the will there is here in the subject no antecedent feeling tending to morality for this is impossible since every feeling is sensible and the motive of moral intention must be free from all sensible conditions on the contrary while the sensible feeling which is at the bottom of all our inclinations is the condition of that impression which we call respect the cause that determines it lies in the pure practical reason and this impression therefore on account of its origin must be called not a pathological but a practical effect for by the fact that the conception of the moral law deprives selflove of its influence and selfconceit of its allusion it lessons the obstacle to pure practical reason and produces the conception of the superiority of its objective law to the impulses of the sensibility and thus by removing the counterpoise it gives relatively greater weight to the law in the judgment of reason in the case of a will affected by the aforesaid impulses thus the respect for the law is not a motive to morality but is morality itself subjectively considered as a motive inasmuch as pure practical reason 0 by rejecting all the rival pretensions of selflove gives authority to the law which now alone has influence now it is to be observed that as respect is an effect on feeling and therefore on the sensibility of a rational being it presupposes this sensibility and therefore also the finiteness of such beings on whom the moral law imposes respect and that respect for the law can not be attributed to a supreme being or to any being free from all sensibility and in whom therefore this sensibility can not be an obstacle to practical reason this feeling sentiment which we call the moral feeling is therefore produced simply by reason it does not serve for the estimation of actions nor for the foundation of the objective moral law itself but merely as a motive to make this of itself a maxim but what name could we more suitably apply to this singular feeling which can not be compared to any pathological feeling it is of such a peculiar kind that it seems to be at the disposal of reason only and that pure practical reason respect applies always to persons onlyâ€”not to things the latter may arouse inclination and if they are animals e g horses dogs c even love or fear like the sea a volcano a beast of prey but never respect something that comes nearer to this feeling is admiration and this as an affection astonishment can apply to things also e g lofty mountains the magnitude number and distance of the heavenly bodies the strength and swiftness of many animals c but all this is not respect a man also may be an object to me of love fear or admiration even to astonishment and yet not be an object of respect his jocose humour his courage and strength his power from the rank he has amongst others 0 may inspire me with sentiments of this kind but still inner respect for him is wanting fontenelle says i bow before a great man but my mind does not bow i would add before an humble plain man in whom i perceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than i am conscious of in myself my mind bows whether i choose it or not and though i bear my head never so high that he may not forget my superior rank why is this because his example exhibits to me a law that humbles my selfconceit when i compare it with my conduct a law the practicability of obedience to which i see proved by fact before my eyes now i may even be conscious of a like degree of uprightness and yet the respect remains for since in man all good is defective the law made visible by an example still humbles my pride my standard being furnished by a man whose imperfections whatever they may be are not known to me as my own are and who therefore appears to me in a more favourable light respect is a tribute which we can not refuse 0 to merit whether we will or not we may indeed outwardly withhold it but we can not help feeling it inwardly respect is so far from being a feeling of pleasure that we only reluctantly give way to it as regards a man we try to find out something that may lighten the burden of it some fault to compensate us for the humiliation which such an example causes even the dead are not always secure from this criticism especially if their example appears inimitable even the moral law itself in its solemn majesty is exposed to this endeavour to save oneself from yielding it respect 0 can it be thought that it is for any other reason that we are so ready to reduce it to the level of our familiar inclination or that it is for any other reason that we all take such trouble to make it out to be the chosen precept of our own interest well understood but that we want to be free from the deterrent respect which shows us our own unworthiness with such severity nevertheless on the other hand so little is there pain in it that if once one has laid aside selfconceit and allowed practical influence to that respect he can never be satisfied with contemplating the majesty of this law and the soul believes itself elevated in proportion as it sees the holy law elevated above it and its frail nature no doubt great talents and activity proportioned to them may also occasion respect or an analogous feeling it is very proper to yield it to them and then it appears as if this sentiment were
