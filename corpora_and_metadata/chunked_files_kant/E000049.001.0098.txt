which alone make maxims properly moral and give them a moral worth namely the direct conception of the law and the objective necessity of obeying it as our duty must be regarded as the proper springs of actions since otherwise legality of actions might be produced but not morality of character but it is not so clear on the contrary it must at first sight seem to everyone very improbable that even subjectively that exhibition of pure virtue can have more power over the human mind 0 and supply a far stronger spring even for effecting that legality of actions and can produce more powerful resolutions 00 to prefer the law from pure respect for it to every other consideration than all the deceptive allurements of pleasure or of all that may be reckoned as happiness or even than all threatenings of pain and misfortune nevertheless this is actually the case and if human nature were not so constituted no mode of presenting the law by roundabout ways and indirect recommendations would ever produce morality of character all would be simple hypocrisy the law would be hated or at least despised while it was followed for the sake of ones own advantage the letter of the law legality would be found in our actions but not the spirit of it in our minds morality and as with all our efforts we could not quite free ourselves from reason in our judgment we must inevitably appear in our own eyes worthless depraved men even though we should seek to compensate ourselves for this mortification before the inner tribunal by enjoying the pleasure that a supposed natural or divine law might be imagined to have connected with a sort of police machinery regulating its operations by what was done without troubling itself about the motives for doing it it can not indeed be denied that in order to bring an uncultivated or degraded mind into the track of moral goodness some preparatory guidance is necessary to attract it by a view of its own advantage or to alarm it by fear of loss but as soon as this mechanical work these leadingstrings have produced some effect then we must bring before the mind the pure moral motive which not only because it is the only one that can be the foundation of a character a practically consistent habit of mind with unchangeable maxims 0 but also because it teaches a man to feel his own dignity gives the mind a power unexpected even by himself to tear himself from all sensible attachments so far as they would fain have the rule and to find a rich compensation for the sacrifice he offers in the independence of his rational nature and the greatness of soul to which he sees that he is destined we will therefore show by such observations as every one can make that this property of our minds this receptivity for a pure moral interest and consequently the moving force of the pure conception of virtue when it is properly applied to the human heart is the most powerful spring and when a continued and punctual observance of moral maxims is in question the only spring of good conduct it must however be remembered that if these observations only prove the reality of such a feeling but do not show any moral improvement brought about by it this is no argument against the only method that exists of making the objectively practical laws of pure reason subjectively practical through the mere force of the conception of duty nor does it prove that this method is a vain delusion for as it has never yet come into vogue experience can say nothing of its results one can only ask for proofs of the receptivity for such springs and these i will now briefly present and then sketch the method of founding and cultivating genuine moral dispositions when we attend to the course of conversation in mixed companies consisting not merely of learned persons and subtle reasoners but also of men of business or of women we observe that besides storytelling and jesting another kind of entertainment finds a place in them namely argument for stories if they are to have novelty and interest are soon exhausted and jesting is likely to become insipid 0 now of all argument there is none in which persons are more ready to join who find any other subtle discussion tedious none that brings more liveliness into the company than that which concerns the moral worth of this or that action by which the character of some person is to be made out persons to whom in other cases anything subtle and speculative in theoretical questions is dry and irksome presently join in when the question is to make out the moral import of a good or bad action that has been related and they display an exactness a refinement a subtlety in excogitating everything that can lessen the purity of purpose and consequently the degree of virtue in it which we do not expect from them in any other kind of speculation in these criticisms persons who are passing judgment on others often reveal their own character some in exercising their judicial office especially upon the dead seem inclined chiefly to defend the goodness that is related of this or that deed against all injurious charges of insincerity and ultimately to defend the whole moral worth of the person against the reproach of dissimulation and secret wickedness others on the contrary turn their thoughts more upon attacking this worth by accusation and faultfinding we can not always however attribute to these latter the intention of arguing away virtue altogether out of all human examples in order to make it an empty name often on the contrary it is only wellmeant strictness in determining the true moral import of actions according to an uncompromising law comparison with such a law instead of with examples lowers selfconceit
