may expect similar cases just as animals do that is that we reject the notion of cause altogether as false and a mere delusion as to attempting to remedy this want of objective and consequent universal validity by saying that we can see no ground for attributing any other sort of knowledge to other rational beings if this reasoning were valid our ignorance would do more for the enlargement of our knowledge than all our meditation for then on this very ground that we have no knowledge of any other rational beings besides man we should have a right to suppose them to be of the same nature as we know ourselves to be that is we should really know them i omit to mention that universal assent does not prove the objective validity of a judgment ie its validity as a cognition and although this universal assent should accidentally happen it could furnish no proof of agreement with the object on the contrary it is the objective validity which alone constitutes the basis of a necessary universal consent hume would be quite satisfied with this system of universal empiricism for as is well known he desired nothing more than that instead of ascribing any objective meaning to the necessity in the concept of cause a merely subjective one should be assumed viz custom in order to deny that reason could judge about god freedom and immortality and if once his principles were granted he was certainly well able to deduce his conclusions therefrom with all logical coherence but even hume did not make his empiricism so universal as to include mathematics he holds the principles of mathematics to be analytical and if this were correct they would certainly be apodictic also but we could not infer from this that reason has the faculty of forming apodictic judgments in philosophy also—that is to say those which are synthetical judgments like the judgment of causality but if we adopt a universal empiricism then mathematics will be included now if this science is in contradiction with a reason that 00 admits only empirical principles as it inevitably is in the antinomy in which mathematics prove the infinite divisibility of space which empiricism can not admit then the greatest possible evidence of demonstration is in manifest contradiction with the alleged conclusions from experience and we are driven to ask like cheseldens blind patient which deceives me sight or touch for empiricism is based on a necessity felt rationalism on a necessity seen and thus universal empiricism reveals itself as absolute scepticism it is erroneous to attribute this in such an unqualified sense to hume since he left at least one certain touchstone of experience namely mathematics whereas thorough scepticism admits no such touchstone which can only be found in à priori principles although experience consists not only of feelings but also of judgments however as in this philosophical and critical age such empiricism can scarcely be serious and it is probably put forward only as an intellectual exercise and for the purpose of putting in a clearer light by contrast the necessity of rational à priori principles we can only be grateful to those who employ themselves in this otherwise uninstructive labour 0 introduction of the idea of a critique of practical reason the theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the cognitive faculty only and a critical examination of it with reference to this use applied properly only to the pure faculty of cognition because this raised the suspicion which was afterwards confirmed that it might easily pass beyond its limits and be lost among unattainable objects or even contradictory notions it is quite different with the practical use of reason in this reason is concerned with the grounds of determination of the will which is a faculty either to produce objects corresponding to ideas or to determine ourselves to the effecting of such objects whether the physical power is sufficient or not that is to determine our causality for here reason can at least attain so far as to determine the will and has always objective reality in so far as it is the volition only that is in question the first question here then is whether pure reason of itself alone suffices to determine the will or whether it can be a ground of determination only as dependent on empirical conditions 0 now here there comes in a notion of causality justified by the critique of the pure reason although not capable of being presented empirically viz that of freedom and if we can now discover means of proving that this property does in fact belong to the human will and so to the will of all rational beings then it will not only be shown that pure reason can be practical but that it alone and not reason empirically limited is indubitably practical consequently we shall have to make a critical examination not of pure practical reason but 0 only of practical reason generally for when once pure reason is shown to exist it needs no critical examination for reason itself contains the standard for the critical examination of every use of it the critique then of practical reason generally is bound to prevent the empirically conditioned reason from claiming exclusively to furnish the ground of determination of the will if it is proved that there is a practical reason its employment is alone immanent the empirically conditioned use which claims supremacy is on the contrary transcendent and expresses itself in demands and precepts which go quite beyond its sphere this is just the opposite of what might be said of pure reason in its speculative employment however as it is still pure reason the knowledge of which is here the foundation of its practical employment the general outline of the classification of a critique of practical reason must be arranged in accordance with that of the speculative we must then have the elements and the methodology
