alone among all possible imperatives can be unconditional or still better converting the proposition if there is a categorical imperative i e a law for the will of every rational being it can only command that everything be done from maxims of ones will regarded as a will which could at the same time will that it should itself give universal laws for in that case only the practical principle and the imperative which it obeys are unconditional since they can not be based on any interest looking back now on all previous attempts to discover the principle of morality we need not wonder why they all failed it was seen that man was bound to laws by duty but it was not observed that the laws to which he is subject are only those of his own giving though at the same time they are universal and that he is only bound to act in conformity with his own will a will however which is designed by nature to give universal laws for when one has conceived man only as subject to a law no matter what then this law required some interest either by way of attraction or constraint since it did not originate as a law from his own will but this will was according to a law obliged by something else to act in a certain manner now by this necessary consequence all the labour spent in finding a supreme principle of duty was irrevocably lost for men never elicited duty but only a necessity of acting from a certain interest whether this interest was private or otherwise in any case the imperative must be conditional and could not by any means be capable of being a moral command i will therefore call this the principle of autonomy of the will in contrast with every other which i accordingly reckon as heteronomy the conception of every rational being as one which must consider itself as giving in all the maxims of its will universal laws so as to judge itself and its actions from this point of viewâ€”this conception leads to another which depends on it and is very fruitful namely that of a kingdom of ends by a kingdom i understand the union of different rational beings in a system by common laws now since it is by laws that ends are determined as regards their universal validity hence if we abstract from the personal differences of rational beings and likewise from all the content of their private ends we shall be able to conceive all ends combined in a systematic whole including both rational beings as ends in themselves and also the special ends which each may propose to himself that is to say we can conceive a kingdom of ends which on the preceding principles is possible for all rational beings come under the law that each of them must treat itself and all others never merely as means but in every case at the same time as ends in themselves hence results a systematic union of rational beings by common objective laws ie a kingdom which may be called a kingdom of ends since what these laws have in view is just the relation of these beings to one another as ends and means it is certainly only an ideal a rational being belongs as a member to the kingdom of ends when although giving universal laws in it he is also himself subject to these laws he belongs to it as sovereign when while giving laws he is not subject to the will of any other a rational being must always regard himself as giving laws either as member or as sovereign in a kingdom of ends which is rendered possible by the freedom of will he can not however maintain the latter position merely by the maxims of his will but only in case he is a completely independent being without wants and with unrestricted power adequate to his will morality consists then in the reference of all action to the legislation which alone can render a kingdom of ends possible this legislation must be capable of existing in every rational being and of emanating from his will so that the principle of this will is never to act on any maxim which could not without contradiction be also a universal law and accordingly always so to act that the will could at the same time regard itself as giving in its maxims universal laws if now the maxims of rational beings are not by their own nature coincident with this objective principle then the necessity of acting on it is called practical necessitation ie duty duty does not apply to the sovereign in the kingdom of ends but it does to every member of it and to all in the same degree the practical necessity of acting on this principle ie duty does not rest at all on feelings impulses or inclinations but solely on the relation of rational beings to one another a relation in which the will of a rational being must always be regarded as legislative since otherwise it could not be conceived as an end in itself reason then refers every maxim of the will regarding it as legislating universally to every other will and also to every action towards oneself and this not on account of any other practical motive or any future advantage but from the idea of the dignity of a rational being obeying no law but that which he himself also gives in the kingdom of ends everything has either value or dignity whatever has a value can be replaced by something else which is equivalent whatever on the other hand is above all value and therefore admits of no equivalent has a dignity whatever has reference to the general inclinations and wants of mankind has a market value whatever without presupposing a want corresponds to a certain taste that is
