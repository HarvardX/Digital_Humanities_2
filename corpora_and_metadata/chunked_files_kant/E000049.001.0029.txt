desires and inclinations arise and from these again maxims by the cooperation of reason for all this belongs to an empirical psychology which would constitute the second part of physics if we regard physics as the philosophy of nature so far as it is based on empirical laws but here we are concerned with objective practical laws and consequently with the relation of the will to itself so far as it is determined by reason alone in which case whatever has reference to anything empirical is necessarily excluded since if reason of itself alone determines the conduct and it is the possibility of this that we are now investigating it must necessarily do so Ã  priori the will is conceived as a faculty of determining oneself to action in accordance with the conception of certain laws and such a faculty can be found only in rational beings now that which serves the will as the objective ground of its selfdetermination is the end and if this is assigned by reason alone it must hold for all rational beings on the other hand that which merely contains the ground of possibility of the action of which the effect is the end this is called the means the subjective ground of the desire is the spring the objective ground of the volition is the motive hence the distinction between subjective ends which rest on springs and objective ends which depend on motives valid for every rational being practical principles are formal when they abstract from all subjective ends they are material when they assume these and therefore particular springs of action the ends which a rational being proposes to himself at pleasure as effects of his actions material ends are all only relative for it is only their relation to the particular desires of the subject that gives them their worth which therefore can not furnish principles universal and necessary for all rational beings and for every volition that is to say practical laws hence all these relative ends can give rise only to hypothetical imperatives supposing however that there were something whose existence has in itself an absolute worth something which being an end in itself could be a source of definite laws then in this and this alone would lie the source of a possible categorical imperative ie a practical law now i say man and generally any rational being exists as an end in himself not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will but in all his actions whether they concern himself or other rational beings must be always regarded at the same time as an end all objects of the inclinations have only a conditional worth for if the inclinations and the wants founded on them did not exist then their object would be without value but the inclinations themselves being sources of want are so far from having an absolute worth for which they should be desired that on the contrary it must be the universal wish of every rational being to be wholly free from them thus the worth of any object which is to be acquired by our action is always conditional beings whose existence depends not on our will but on natures have nevertheless if they are irrational beings only a relative value as means and are therefore called things rational beings on the contrary are called persons because their very nature points them out as ends in themselves that is as something which must not be used merely as means and so far therefore restricts freedom of action and is an object of respect these therefore are not merely subjective ends whose existence has a worth for us as an effect of our action but objective ends that is things whose existence is an end in itself an end moreover for which no other can be substituted which they should subserve merely as means for otherwise nothing whatever would possess absolute worth but if all worth were conditioned and therefore contingent then there would be no supreme practical principle of reason whatever if then there is a supreme practical principle or in respect of the human will a categorical imperative it must be one which being drawn from the conception of that which is necessarily an end for every one because it is an end in itself constitutes an objective principle of will and can therefore serve as a universal practical law the foundation of this principle is rational nature exists as an end in itself man necessarily conceives his own existence as being so so far then this is a subjective principle of human actions but every other rational being regards its existence similarly just on the same rational principle that holds for me so that it is at the same time an objective principle from which as a supreme practical law all laws of the will must be capable of being deduced accordingly the practical imperative will be as follows so act as to treat humanity whether in thine own person or in that of any other in every case as an end withal never as means only we will now inquire whether this can be practically carried out to abide by the previous examples firstly under the head of necessary duty to oneself he who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself if he destroys himself in order to escape from painful circumstances he uses a person merely as a mean to maintain a tolerable condition up to the end of life but a man is not a thing that is to say something which can be used merely as means but must in all his actions be always considered as an end in himself i can not therefore dispose in any way of a man in my own person so as to mutilate him to damage or kill him
