synthetical judgment about them nor determine their application theoretically consequently we can make no theoretical rational use of them at all in which use all speculative knowledge of reason consists nevertheless the theoretical knowledge not indeed of these objects but of reason generally is so far enlarged by this that by the practical postulates objects were given to those ideas a merely problematical thought having by this means first acquired objective reality there is therefore no extension of the knowledge of given supersensible objects but an extension of theoretical reason and of its knowledge in respect of the supersensible generally inasmuch as it is compelled to admit that there are such objects although it is not able to define them more closely so as itself to extend this knowledge of the objects which have now been given it on practical grounds and only for practical use for this accession then pure theoretical reason for which all those ideas are transcendent and without object has simply to thank its practical faculty in this they become immanent and constitutive being the source of the possibility of realizing the necessary object of pure practical reason the summum bonum whereas apart from this they are transcendent and merely regulative principles of speculative reason which do not require it to assume a new object beyond experience but only to bring its use in experience nearer to completeness but when once reason is in possession of this accession it will go to work with these ideas as speculative reason properly only to assure the certainty of its practical use in a negative manner that is not extending but clearing up its knowledge so as on one side to keep off anthropomorphism as the source of superstition or seeming extension of these conceptions by supposed experience and on the other side fanaticism which promises the same by means of supersensible intuition or feelings of the like kind all these are hindrances to the practical use of pure reason so that the removal of them may certainly be considered an extension of our knowledge in a practical point of view without contradicting the admission that for speculative purposes reason has not in the least gained by this every employment of reason in respect of an object requires pure concepts of the understanding categories without which no object can be conceived these can be applied to the theoretical employment of reason i e to that kind of knowledge only in case an intuition which is always sensible is taken as a basis and therefore merely in order 0 to conceive by means of them an object of possible experience now here what have to be thought by means of the categories in order to be known are ideas of reason which can not be given in any experience only we are not here concerned with the theoretical knowledge of the objects of these ideas but only with this whether they have objects at all this reality is supplied by pure practical reason and theoretical reason has nothing further to do in this but to think those objects by means of categories this as we have elsewhere clearly shown can be done well enough without needing any intuition either sensible or supersensible because the categories have their seat and origin in the pure understanding simply as the faculty of thought before and independently on any intuition and they always only signify an object in general no matter in what way it may be given to us now when the categories are to be applied to these ideas it is not possible to give them any object in intuition but that such an object actually exists and consequently that the category as a mere form of thought is here not empty but has significance this is sufficiently assured them by an object which practical reason presents beyond doubt in the concept of the summum bonum namely the reality of the conceptions which are required for the possibility of the summum bonum without however effecting by this accession the least extension of our knowledge on theoretical principles when these ideas of god of an intelligible world the kingdom of god and of immortality are further determined by predicates taken from our own nature we must not regard this determination as a sensualizing of those pure rational ideas anthropomorphism nor as a transcendent knowledge of supersensible objects for these predicates are no others than understanding and will considered too in the relation to each other in which they must be conceived in the moral law and therefore only so far as a pure practical use is made of them as to all the rest that belongs to these conceptions psychologically that is so far as we observe these faculties of ours empirically in their exercise eg that the understanding of man is discursive and its notions therefore not intuitions but thoughts that these follow one another in time that his will has its satisfaction always dependent on the existence of its object c which can not be the case in the supreme being from all this we abstract in that case and then there remains of the notions by which we conceive a pure intelligence nothing more than just what is required for the possibility of conceiving a moral law there is then a knowledge of god indeed but only for practical purposes and if we attempt to extend it to a theoretical knowledge we find an understanding that has intuitions not thoughts a will that is directed to objects on the existence of which its satisfaction does not in the least depend not to mention the transcendental predicates as for example a magnitude of existence that is duration which however is not in time the only possible means we have of conceiving existence as magnitude now these are all attributes of which we can form no conception that would help to the knowledge of the object and we learn from this that
