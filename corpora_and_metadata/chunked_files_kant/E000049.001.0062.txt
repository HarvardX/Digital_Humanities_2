conception of a law the objective reality of a pure will or what is the same thing of a pure practical reason is given in the moral law à priori as it were by a fact for so we may name a determination of the will which is inevitable although it does not rest on empirical principles now in the notion of a will the notion of causality is already contained and hence the notion of a pure will contains that of a causality accompanied with freedom that is one which is not determinable by physical laws and consequently is not capable of any empirical intuition in proof of its reality but nevertheless completely justifies its objective reality à priori in the pure practical law not indeed as is easily seen for the purposes of the theoretical but of the practical use of reason now the notion of a being that has free will is the notion of a causa noumenon and that this notion involves no contradiction we are already assured by the fact—that inasmuch as the concept of cause has arisen wholly from pure understanding and has its objective reality assured by the deduction as it is moreover in its origin independent on any sensible conditions it is therefore not restricted to phenomena unless we wanted to make a definite theoretic use of it but can be applied equally to things that are objects of the pure understanding but since this application can not rest on any intuition for intuition can only be sensible therefore causa noumenon as regards the theoretic use of reason although a possible and thinkable is yet an empty notion now i do not desire by means of this to understand theoretically the nature of a being in so far as it has a pure will it is enough for me to have thereby designated it as such and hence to combine the notion of causality with that of freedom and what is inseparable from it the moral law as its determining principle now this right i certainly have by virtue of the pure notempirical origin of the notion of cause since i do not consider myself entitled to make any use of it except in reference to the moral law which determines its reality that is only a practical use if with hume i had denied to the notion of causality all objective reality in its theoretic use not merely with regard to things in themselves the supersensible but also with regard to the objects of the senses it would have lost all significance and being a theoretically impossible notion would have been declared to be quite useless and since what is nothing can not be made any use of the practical use of a concept theoretically null would have been absurd but as it is the concept of a causality free from empirical conditions although empty i e without any appropriate intuition is yet theoretically possible and refers to an indeterminate object but in compensation significance is given to it in the moral law and consequently in a practical sense i have indeed no intuition which should determine its objective theoretic reality but not the less it has a real application which is exhibited in concreto in intentions or maxims that is it has a practical reality which can be specified and this is sufficient to justify it even with a view to noumena now this objective reality of a pure concept of the understanding in the sphere of the supersensible once brought in gives an objective reality also to all the other categories although only so far as they stand in necessary connexion with the determining principle of the will the moral law a reality only of practical application which has not the least effect in enlarging our theoretical knowledge of these objects or the discernment of their nature by pure reason so we shall find also in the sequel that these categories refer only to beings as intelligences and in them only to the relation of reason to the will consequently always only to the practical and beyond this can not pretend to any knowledge of these beings and whatever other properties belonging to the theoretical representation of supersensible things may be brought into connexion with these categories this is not to be reckoned as knowledge but only as a right in a practical point of view however it is a necessity to admit and assume such beings even in the case where we conceive supersensible beings e g god according to analogy that is a purely rational relation of which we make a practical use with reference to what is sensible and thus the application to the supersensible solely in a practical point of view does not give pure theoretic reason the least encouragement to run riot into the transcendent chapter ii of the concept of an object of pure practical reason by a concept of the practical reason i understand the idea of an object as an effect possible to be produced through freedom to be an object of practical knowledge as such signifies therefore only the relation of the will to the action by which the object or its opposite would be realized and to decide whether something is an object of pure practical reason or not is only to discern the possibility or impossibility of willing the action by which if we had the required power about which experience must decide a certain object would be realized if the object be taken as the determining principle of our desire it must first be known whether it is physically possible by the free use of our powers before we decide whether it is an object of practical reason or not on the other hand if the law can be considered à priori as the determining principle of the action and the latter therefore as determined by pure practical reason the judgment whether a thing is an object
