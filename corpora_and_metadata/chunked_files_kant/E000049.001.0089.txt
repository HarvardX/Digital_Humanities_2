of god as a postulate of pure practical reason in the foregoing analysis the moral law led to a practical problem which is prescribed by pure reason alone without the aid of any sensible motives namely that of the necessary completeness of the first and principal element of the summum bonum viz morality and as this can be perfectly solved only in eternity to the postulate of immortality the same law must also lead us to affirm the possibility of the second element of the summum bonum viz happiness proportioned to that morality and this on grounds as disinterested as before and solely from impartial reason that is it must lead to the supposition of the existence of a cause adequate to this effect in other words it must postulate the existence of god as the necessary condition of the possibility of the summum bonum an object of the will which is necessarily connected with the moral legislation of pure reason we proceed to exhibit this connexion in a convincing manner happiness is the condition of a rational being in the world with whom everything goes according to his wish and will it rests therefore on the harmony of physical nature with his whole end and likewise with the essential determining principle of his will now the moral law as a law of freedom commands by determining principles which ought to be quite independent on nature and on its harmony with our faculty of desire as springs but the acting rational being in the world is not the cause of the world and of nature itself there is not the least ground therefore in the moral law for a necessary connexion between morality and proportionate happiness in a being that belongs to the world as part of it and therefore dependent on it and which for that reason can not by his will be a cause of this nature nor by his own power make it thoroughly harmonize as far as his happiness is concerned with his practical principles nevertheless in the practical problem of pure reason ie the necessary pursuit of the summum bonum such a connexion is postulated as necessary we ought to endeavour to promote the summum bonum which therefore must be possible accordingly the existence of a cause of all nature distinct from nature itself and containing the principle of this connexion namely of the exact harmony of happiness with morality is also postulated now this supreme cause must contain the principle of the harmony of nature not merely with a law of the will of rational beings but with the conception of this law in so far as they make it the supreme determining principle of the will and consequently not merely with the form of morals but with their morality as their motive that is with their moral character therefore the summum bonum is possible in the world only on the supposition of a supreme being having a causality corresponding to moral character now a being that is capable of acting on the conception of laws is an intelligence a rational being and the causality of such a being according to this conception of laws is his will therefore the supreme cause of nature which must be presupposed as a condition of the summum bonum is a being which is the cause of nature by intelligence and will consequently its author that is god it follows that the postulate of the possibility of the highest derived good the best world is likewise the postulate of the reality of a highest original good that is to say of the existence of god now it was seen to be a duty for us to promote the summum bonum consequently it is not merely allowable but it is a necessity connected with duty as a requisite that we should presuppose the possibility of this summum bonum and as this is possible only on condition of the existence of god it inseparably connects the supposition of this with duty that is it is morally necessary to assume the existence of god it must be remarked here that this moral necessity is subjective that is it is a want and not objective that is itself a duty for there can not be a duty to suppose the existence of anything since this concerns only the theoretical employment of reason moreover it is not meant by this that it is necessary to suppose the existence of god as a basis of all obligation in general for this rests as has been sufficiently proved simply on the autonomy of reason itself what belongs to duty here is only the endeavour to realize and promote the summum bonum in the world the possibility of which can therefore be postulated and as our reason finds it not conceivable except on the supposition of a supreme intelligence the admission of this existence is therefore connected with the consciousness of our duty although the admission itself belongs to the domain of speculative reason considered in respect of this alone as a principle of explanation it may be called a hypothesis but in reference to the intelligibility of an object given us by the moral law the summum bonum and consequently of a requirement for practical purposes it may be called faith that is to say a pure rational faith since pure reason both in its theoretical and its practical use is the sole source from which it springs from this deduction it is now intelligible why the greek schools could never attain the solution of their problem of the practical possibility of the summum bonum because they made the rule of the use which the will of man makes of his freedom the sole and sufficient ground of this possibility thinking that they had no need for that purpose of the existence of god no doubt they were so far right that they established the principle of morals of itself independently on this postulate from
