principle which contains the medium of its application he adduces p the doctrine of equality as the first link forming the social chain p namely that no man can be bound by any laws except those to the formation of which he has contributed in a very contracted society this principle may be directly applied and become the ordinary rule without requiring any middle principle but in a very numerous society we must add a new principle to that which we here state this middle principle is that the individuals may contribute to the formation of the laws either in their own person or by representatives whoever would try to apply the first principle to a numerous society without taking in the middle principle would infallibly bring about its destruction but this circumstance which would only show the ignorance or incompetence of the lawgiver would prove nothing against the principle itself he concludes p thus a principle recognised as truth must therefore never be abandoned however obviously danger may seem to be involved in it and yet the good man himself abandoned the unconditional principle of veracity on account of the danger to society because he could not discover any middle principle would serve to prevent this danger and in fact no such principle is to be interpolated here retaining the names of the persons as they have been here brought forward the french philosopher confounds the action by which one does harm nocet to another by telling the truth the admission of which he can not avoid with the action by which he does him wrong lædit it was merely an accident casus that the truth of the statement did harm to the inhabitant of the house it was not a free deed in the juridicial sense for to admit his right to require another to tell a lie for his benefit would be to admit a claim opposed to all law every man has not only a right but the strictest duty to truthfulness in statements which he can not avoid whether they do harm to himself or others he himself properly speaking does not do harm to him who suffers thereby but this harm is caused by accident for the man is not free to choose since if he must speak at all veracity is an unconditional duty the german philosopher will therefore not adopt as his principle the proposition p it is a duty to speak the truth but only to him who has a right to the truth first on account of the obscurity of the expression for truth is not a possession the right to which can be granted to one and refused to another and next and chiefly because the duty of veracity of which alone we are speaking here makes no distinction between persons towards whom we have this duty and towards whom we may be free from it but is an unconditional duty which holds in all circumstances now in order to proceed from a metaphysic of right which abstracts from all conditions of experience to a principle of politics which implies these notions to cases of experience and by means of this to the solution of a problem of the latter in accordance with the general principle of right the philosopher will enunciate— an axiom that is an apodictically certain proposition which follows directly from the definition of external right harmony of the freedom of each with the freedom of all by a universal law a postulate of external public law as the united will of all on the principle of equality without which there could not exist the freedom of all a problem how it is to be arranged that harmony may be maintained in a society however large on principles of freedom and equality namely by means of a representative system and this will then become a principle of the political system the establishment and arrangement of which will contain enactments which drawn from practical knowledge of men have in view only the mechanism of administration of justice and how this is to be suitably carried out justice must never be accommodated to the political system but always the political system to justice a principle recognised as true i add recognised à priori and therefore apodictic must never be abandoned however obviously danger may seem to be involved in it says the author only here we must not understand the danger of doing harm accidentally but of doing wrong and this would happen if the duty of veracity which is quite unconditional and constitutes the supreme condition of justice in utterances were made conditional and subordinate to other considerations and although by a certain lie i in fact do no wrong to any person yet i infringe the principle of justice in regard to all indispensably necessary statements generally i do wrong formally though not materially and this is much worse than to commit an injustice to any individual because such a deed does not presuppose any principle leading to it in the subject the man who when asked whether in the statement he is about to make he intends to speak truth or not does not receive the question with indignation at the suspicion thus expressed towards him that he might be a liar but who asks permission first to consider possible exceptions is already a liar in potentia since he shows that he does not recognize veracity as a duty in itself but reserves exceptions from a rule which in its nature does not admit of exceptions since to do so would be selfcontradictory all practical principles of justice must contain strict truths and the principles here called middle principles can only contain the closer definition of their application to actual cases according to the rules of politics and never exceptions from them since exceptions destroy the universality an account of which alone they bear the name of principles ii —on the saying necessity has no
