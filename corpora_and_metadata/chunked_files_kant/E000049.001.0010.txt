the most delicate manner possible for the purchase of a new one kant however preferred to retain his shabby coat rather than incur debt xlix or lose his independence in his old age he boasted that he had never owed any man a penny so that when a knock came to his door he was never afraid to say come in when his means had increased chiefly through the profits on his writings he assisted such of his relatives as were in want in the most liberal manner on the death of his brother he assigned to the widow a pension of 00 thalers many poor persons also received a weekly allowance from him and wasianski who in later years managed kants affairs for him states that his charitable expenses amounted to about 00 thalers annually his kindness was shown in his last will in which he left an annual sum to a servant who had treated him shamefully but who had served him not indeed faithfully for thirty years kant had dismissed him two years before with a pension on condition of his never setting foot inside the house again after some other small legacies the residue was left to the children of his brother and sisters the whole amount was under four thousand pounds the principal questions on the theory of morals may with sufficient accuracy for the present purpose be said to be these first the purely speculative question what is the essential nature of moral rightness secondly the practical questions what is to man the criterion of his duty and what is the foundation of obligation the additional question by what faculty do we discern right and wrong is properly a psychological one l if we had only to do with a being in whom reason was irresistibly dominant we should not need to raise any further questions but having to treat of a being with affections and appetites distinct from reason and not of themselves dependent on it we must answer the further question how is reason to maintain its authority in spite of these resisting forces ie what is the motive lastly since we have to deal with a corrupt creature a new question arises how is such a creature to be reformed now how does kant deal with these questions his categorical imperative—act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature—gives perhaps not the essence of virtue but a property of it which may indeed serve as a subjective criterion that this criterion is formal only and therefore empty is hardly of itself a valid objection the test of valid reasoning the syllogism is equally empty the categorical imperative is however rather negative than positive and it is far from being sufficiently clear as a test of the morality of actions this appears even in the examples which kant himself gives for example treating of compassion he supposes that if a man refuses aid to the distressed it is out of selfishness and then shows that if selfishness was the ruling principle it would contradict itself but why assume a motive for refusing help what we want is a motive for giving help there is nothing contradictory in willing that none should help others so in the case of gratitude there is no contradiction in willing that those who receive benefits should entertain no peculiar feeling toward their benefactor it is true we should look li for it ourselves but this implies that such a feeling is natural to man and that we approve it again put the case of selfsacrifice of a man giving his life to save his friend it would seem as easy on kants principle to prove this a vice as a virtue kant has in fact treated human nature too abstractly in eliminating the matter he has eliminated that on which frequently the whole question turns indeed in some of the instances he himself chooses he elicits a contradiction only by bringing in a teleological consideration e g as to suicide he brings in the end for which selflove was given the will to destroy ones own life is not contradictory of the will to sustain it unless the circumstances be supposed the same these remarks however only show that the formula is not a mechanical rule of conduct they do not disprove its scientific value in fact precisely similar objections have been alleged against the logical analysis of speculative reasoning that it leaves untouched what in practice is the most difficult part of the problem if all poisonous substances could be brought under a single chemical formula the generalization would be of value both theoretically and practically although its application to particular cases might be difficult and uncertain kant never attempted to deduce a complete code of duty from a purely formal principle he expressly states that lii this is only a negative principle and that the matter of practical maxims is to be derived from a different source cf the present work p nor is it to be supposed that kant was not fully aware of the difficulty of applying his formula to the complex circumstances of actual life in his metaphysic of morals he states a great number of questions of casuistry which he leaves undecided as puzzles or exercises to the reader and indeed similar difficulties might be raised from a speculative point of view respecting the rule whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you even so do unto them—a rule of which we may nevertheless say that in practice it probably never misled anyone for everyone sees that the essence of it is the elimination of selfpartiality and inward dishonesty the scientific basis of it is stated by clarke in language nearly equivalent to kants the reason of it says the former is the same as that which forces us in speculation to affirm that if one line or number be
