making an exception in our own favour or just for this time only in favour of our inclination consequently if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view namely that of reason we should find a contradiction in our own will namely that a certain principle should be objectively necessary as a universal law and yet subjectively should not be universal but admit of exceptions as however we at one moment regard our action from the point of view of a will wholly conformed to reason and then again look at the same action from the point of view of a will affected by inclination there is not really any contradiction but an antagonism of inclination to the precept of reason whereby the universality of the principle is changed into a mere generality so that the practical principle of reason shall meet the maxim half way now although this can not be justified in our own impartial judgment yet it proves that we do really recognise the validity of the categorical imperative and with all respect for it only allow ourselves a few exceptions which we think unimportant and forced from us we have thus established at least this much that if duty is a conception which is to have any import and real legislative authority for our actions it can only be expressed in categorical and not at all in hypothetical imperatives we have also which is of great importance exhibited clearly and definitely for every practical application the content of the categorical imperative which must contain the principle of all duty if there is such a thing at all we have not yet however advanced so far as to prove à priori that there actually is such an imperative that there is a practical law which commands absolutely of itself and without any other impulse and that the following of this law is duty with the view of attaining to this it is of extreme importance to remember that we must not allow ourselves to think of deducing the reality of this principle from the particular attributes of human nature for duty is to be a practical unconditional necessity of action it must therefore hold for all rational beings to whom an imperative can apply at all and for this reason only be also a law for all human wills on the contrary whatever is deduced from the particular natural characteristics of humanity from certain feelings and propensions nay even if possible from any particular tendency proper to human reason and which need not necessarily hold for the will of every rational being this may indeed supply us with a maxim but not with a law with a subjective principle on which we may have a propension and inclination to act but not with an objective principle on which we should be enjoined to act even though all our propensions inclinations and natural dispositions were opposed to it in fact the sublimity and intrinsic dignity of the command in duty are so much the more evident the less the subjective impulses favour it and the more they oppose it without being able in the slighest degree to weaken the obligation of the law or to diminish its validity here then we see philosophy brought to a critical position since it has to be firmly fixed notwithstanding that it has nothing to support it either in heaven or earth here it must show its purity as absolute dictator of its own laws not the herald of those which are whispered to it by an implanted sense or who knows what tutelary nature although these may be better than nothing yet they can never afford principles dictated by reason which must have their source wholly à priori and thence their commanding authority expecting everything from the supremacy of the law and the due respect for it nothing from inclination or else condemning the man to selfcontempt and inward abhorrence thus every empirical element is not only quite incapable of being an aid to the principle of morality but is even highly prejudicial to the purity of morals for the proper and inestimable worth of an absolutely good will consists just in this that the principle of action is free from all influence of contingent grounds which alone experience can furnish we can not too much or too often repeat our warning against this lax and even mean habit of thought which seeks for its principle amongst empirical motives and laws for human reason in its weariness is glad to rest on this pillow and in a dream of sweet illusions in which instead of juno it embraces a cloud it substitutes for morality a bastard patched up from limbs of various derivation which looks like anything one chooses to see in it only not like virtue to one who has once beheld her in her true form the question then is this is it a necessary law for all rational beings that they should always judge of their actions by maxims of which they can themselves will that they should serve as universal laws if it is so then it must be connected altogether à priori with the very conception of the will of a rational being generally but in order to discover this connexion we must however reluctantly take a step into metaphysic although into a domain of it which is distinct from speculative philosophy namely the metaphysic of morals in a practical philosophy where it is not the reasons of what happens that we have to ascertain but the laws of what ought to happen even although it never does i e objective practical laws there it is not necessary to inquire into the reasons why anything pleases or displeases how the pleasure of mere sensation differs from taste and whether the latter is distinct from a general satisfaction of reason on what the feeling of pleasure or pain rests and how from it
