object of all my conduct but i can not hope to effect this otherwise than by the harmony of my will with that of a holy and good author of the world and although the conception of the summum bonum as a whole in which the greatest happiness is conceived as combined in the most exact proportion with the highest degree of moral perfection possible in creatures includes my own happiness yet it is not this that is the determining principle of the will which is enjoined to promote the summum bonum but the moral law which on the contrary limits by strict conditions my unbounded desire of happiness hence also morality is not properly the doctrine how we should make ourselves happy but how we should become worthy of happiness it is only when religion is added that there also comes in the hope of participating some day in happiness in proportion as we have endeavoured to be not unworthy of it a man is worthy to possess a thing or a state when his possession of it is in harmony with the summum bonum we can now easily see that all worthiness depends on moral conduct since in the conception of the summum bonum this constitutes the condition of the rest which belongs to ones state namely the participation of happiness now it follows from this that morality should never be treated as a doctrine of happiness that is an instruction how to become happy for it has to do simply with the rational condition conditio sine qua non of happiness not with the means of attaining it but when morality has been completely expounded which merely imposes duties instead of providing rules for selfish desires then first after the moral desire to promote the summum bonum to bring the kingdom of god to us has been awakened a desire founded on a law and which could not previously arise in any selfish mind and when for the behoof of this desire the step to religion has been taken then this ethical doctrine may be also called a doctrine of happiness because the hope of happiness first begins with religion only we can also see from this that when we ask what is gods ultimate end in creating the world we must not name the happiness of the rational beings in it but the summum bonum which adds a further condition to that wish of such beings namely the condition of being worthy of happiness that is the morality of these same rational beings a condition which alone contains the rule by which only they can hope to share in the former at the hand of a wise author for as wisdom theoretically considered signifies the knowledge of the summum bonum and practically the accordance of the will with the summum bonum we can not attribute to a supreme independent wisdom an end based merely on goodness for we can not conceive the action of this goodness in respect of the happiness of rational beings as suitable to the highest original good except under the restrictive conditions of harmony with the holiness of his will therefore those who placed the end of creation in the glory of god provided that this is not conceived anthropomorphically as a desire to be praised have perhaps hit upon the best expression for nothing glorifies god more than that which is the most estimable thing in the world respect for his command the observance of the holy duty that his law imposes on us when there is added thereto his glorious plan of crowning such a beautiful order of things with corresponding happiness if the latter to speak humanly makes him worthy of love by the former he is an object of adoration even men can never acquire respect by benevolence alone though they may gain love so that the greatest beneficence only procures them honour when it is regulated by worthiness that in the order of ends man and with him every rational being is an end in himself that is that he can never be used merely as a means by any not even by god without being at the same time an end also himself that therefore humanity in our person must be holy to ourselves this follows now of itself because he is the subject of the moral law in other words of that which is holy in itself and on account of which and in agreement with which alone can anything be termed holy for this moral law is founded on the autonomy of his will as a free will which by its universal laws must necessarily be able to agree with that to which it is to submit itself vi â€”of the postulates of pure practical reason in general they all proceed from the principle of morality which is not a postulate but a law by which reason determines the will directly which will because it is so determined as a pure will requires these necessary conditions of obedience to its precept these postulates are not theoretical dogmas but suppositions practically necessary while then they do not extend our speculative knowledge they give objective reality to the ideas of speculative reason in general by means of their reference to what is practical and give it a right to concepts the possibility even of which it could not otherwise venture to affirm these postulates are those of immortality freedom positively considered as the causality of a being so far as he belongs to 0 the intelligible world and the existence of god the first results from the practically necessary condition of a duration adequate to the complete fulfilment of the moral law the second from the necessary supposition of independence on the sensible world and of the faculty of determining ones will according to the law of an intelligible world that is of freedom the third from the necessary condition of the existence of the summum bonum
