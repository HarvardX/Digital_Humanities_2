is not a part but a subjective exposition of the metaphysic of morals in which the emotions that accompany the necessitating force of the moral law make the efficiency of that force to be felt for example disgust horror c which give a sensible form to the moral aversion in order to gain the precedence from the merely sensible incitement xv —of the principle on which ethics is separated from jurisprudence this separation on which the subdivision of moral philosophy in general rests is founded on this that the notion of freedom which is common to both makes it necessary to divide duties into those of external and those of internal freedom the latter of which alone are ethical hence this internal freedom which is the condition of all ethical duty must be discussed as a preliminary discursus præliminaris just as above the doctrine of conscience was discussed as the condition of all duty remarks of the doctrine of virtue on the principle of internal freedom habit habitus is a facility of action and a subjective perfection of the elective will but not every such facility is a free habit habitus libertatis for if it is custom assuetudo that is a uniformity of action which by frequent repetition has become a necessity then it is not a habit proceeding from freedom and therefore not a moral habit virtue therefore can not be defined as a habit of free lawabiding actions unless indeed we add determining itself in its action by the idea of the law and then this habit is not a property of the elective will but of the rational will which is a faculty that in adopting a rule also declares it to be a universal law and it is only such a habit that can be reckoned as virtue two things are required for internal freedom to be master of ones self in a given case animus sui compos and to have command over ones self imperium in semetipsum that is to subdue his emotions and to govern his passions with these conditions the character indoles is noble erecta in the opposite case it is ignoble indoles abjecta serva xvi —virtue requires first of all command over ones self emotions and passions are essentially distinct the former belong to feeling in so far as this coming before reflection makes it more difficult or even impossible hence emotion is called hasty jäh animus præceps and reason declares through the notion of virtue that a man should collect himself but this weakness in the life of ones understanding joined with the strength of a mental excitement is only a lack of virtue untugend and as it were a weak and childish thing which may very well consist with the best will and has further this one good thing in it that this storm soon subsides a propensity to emotion ex gr resentment is therefore not so closely related to vice as passion is passion on the other hand is the sensible appetite grown into a permanent inclination ex gr hatred in contrast to resentment the calmness with which one indulges it leaves room for reflection and allows the mind to frame principles thereon for itself and thus when the inclination falls upon what contradicts the law to brood on it to allow it to root itself deeply and thereby to take up evil as of set purpose into ones maxim and this is then specifically evil that is it is a true vice virtue therefore in so far as it is based on internal freedom contains a positive command for man namely that he should bring all his powers and inclinations under his rule that of reason and this is a positive precept of command over himself which is additional to the prohibition namely that he should not allow himself to be governed by his feelings and inclinations the duty of apathy since unless reason takes the reins of government into its own hands the feelings and inclinations play the master over the man xvii —virtue necessarily presupposes apathy considered as strength this word apathy has come into bad repute just as if it meant want of feeling and therefore subjective indifference with respect to the objects of the elective will it is supposed 0 to be a weakness this misconception may be avoided by giving the name moral apathy to that want of emotion which is to be distinguished from indifference in the former the feelings arising from sensible impressions lose their influence on the moral feeling only because the respect for the law is more powerful than all of them together it is only the apparent strength of a fever patient that makes even the lively sympathy with good rise to an emotion or rather degenerate into it such an emotion is called enthusiasm and it is with reference to this that we are to explain the moderation which is usually recommended in virtuous practices— insani sapiens nomen ferat æquus iniqui ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam —hor for otherwise it is absurd to imagine that one could be too wise or too virtuous the emotion always belongs to the sensibility no matter by what sort of object it may be excited the true strength of virtue is the mind at rest with a firm deliberate resolution to bring its law into practice that is the state of health in the moral life on the contrary the emotion even when it is excited by the idea of the good is a momentary glitter which leaves exhaustion after it we may apply the term fantastically virtuous to the man who will admit nothing to be indifferent in respect of morality adiaphora and who strews all his steps with duties as with traps and will not allow it to be indifferent whether a man eat fish or flesh drink beer or wine when both agree with him—a micrology which if adopted into the doctrine of virtue would
