not my happiness but my morality to maintain which in its integrity is at once my aim and my duty vi —ethics does not supply laws for actions which is done by jurisprudence but only for the maxims of action the notion of duty stands in immediate relation to a law even though i abstract from every end which is the matter of the law as is shown by the formal principle of duty in the categorical imperative act so that the maxims of thy action might become a universal law but in ethics this is conceived as the law of thy own will not of will in general which might be that of others for in the latter case it would give rise to a judicial duty which does not belong to the domain of ethics in ethics maxims are regarded as those subjective laws which merely have the specific character of universal legislation which is only a negative principle not to contradict a law in general how then can there be further a law for the maxims of actions it is the notion of an end which is also a duty a notion peculiar to ethics that alone is the foundation of a law for the maxims of actions by making the subjective end that which every one has subordinate to the objective end that which every one ought to make his own the imperative thou shalt make this or that thy end ex gr the happiness of others applies to the matter of the elective will an object now since no free action is possible without the agent having in view in it some 00 end as matter of his elective will it follows that if there is an end which is also a duty the maxims of actions which are means to ends must contain only the condition of fitness for a possible universal legislation on the other hand the end which is also a duty can make it a law that we should have such a maxim whilst for the maxim itself the possibility of agreeing with a universal legislation is sufficient for maxims of actions may be arbitrary and are only limited by the condition of fitness for a universal legislation which is the formal principle of actions but a law abolishes the arbitrary character of actions and is by this distinguished from recommendation in which one only desires to know the best means to an end vii —ethical duties are of indeterminate juridical duties of strict obligation this proposition is a consequence of the foregoing for if the law can only command the maxim of the actions not the actions themselves this is a sign that it leaves in the observance of it a latitude latitudo for the elective will that is it can not definitely assign how and how much we should do by the action towards the end which is also duty but by an indeterminate duty is not meant a permission to make exceptions from the maxim of the actions but only the permission to limit one maxim of duty by another ex gr the general love of our neighbour by the love of parents and this in fact enlarges the field for the practice of virtue the more indeterminate the duty and the more imperfect accordingly the obligation of the man to the action and the closer he nevertheless brings this maxim of obedience thereto in his own mind to the strict duty of justice des rechts so much the more perfect is his virtuous action hence it is only imperfect duties that are duties of virtue the fulfilment of them is merit meritum a but their transgression is not necessarily demerit demeritum a but only moral unworth 0 unless the agent made it a principle not to conform to those duties the strength of purpose in the former case is alone properly called virtue tugend virtus the weakness 0 in the latter case is not vice vitium but rather only lack of virtue untugend a want of moral strength defectus moralis as the word tugend is derived from taugen to be good for something untugend by its etymology signifies good for nothing every action contrary to duty is called transgression peccatum deliberate transgression which has become a principle is what properly constitutes what is called vice vitium although the conformity of actions to justice recht i e to be an upright rechtlicher man is nothing meritorious yet the conformity of the maxim of such actions regarded as duties that is reverence for justice is meritorious for by this the man makes the right of humanity or of men his own end and thereby enlarges his notion of duty beyond that of indebtedness officium debiti since although another man by virtue of his rights can demand that my actions shall conform to the law he can not demand that the law shall also contain the spring of these actions the same thing is true of the general ethical command act dutifully from a sense of duty to fix this disposition firmly in ones mind and to quicken it is as in the former case meritorious because it goes beyond the law of duty in actions and makes the law in itself the spring but just for this reason those duties also must be reckoned as of indeterminate obligation in respect of which there exists a subjective principle which ethically rewards them or to bring them as near as possible to the notion of a strict obligation a principle of susceptibility of this reward according to the law of virtue namely a moral pleasure which goes beyond mere satisfaction with ones self which may be merely negative and of which it is proudly said that in this consciousness virtue is its own reward when this merit is a merit of the man in respect of other men of promoting their natural ends which are recognized as such by all men
