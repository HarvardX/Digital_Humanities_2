portrait london longmans green co paternosterrow iv for heavens sake buy two books kants fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals and kants critical examination of the practical reason kant is not a light of the world but a whole solar system at once jean paul richter first edition of this translation second edition enlarged third edition further enlarged fourth edition dublin printed at the university press by ponsonby and weldrick v translators preface to third edition this volume contains the whole of kants works on the general theory of ethies it consists of four parts— i a complete translation of the grundlegung zur metaphysik der sitten this work was first published in ii a complete translation of the kritik der praktischen vernunft first published in iii a translation of the general introduction to the metaphysical elements of moral philosophy metaphysische anfangsgrunde der sittenlehre and of the preface and introduction to the metaphysical elements of ethics metaph anfangsgründe der tugendlehre iv the first portion of die religion innerhalb der grenzen der blossen vernunft otherwise named philosophische religionslehre this portion was first published vi by kant himself separately in and it appears to me to be indispensable to a complete view of kants ethics the remainder of the work first edition does not come within the sphere of ethics proper i have added in an appendix a translation of kants essay—ueber ein vermeintes recht aus menschenliebe zu lügen werke ed rosenkr vol vii which is interesting as throwing further light on kants application of his principles the first of these treatises and half of the second were translated by mr semple edinburgh reprinted in connexion with the greater part of the metaphysik der sitten which is concerned with the discussion of particular virtues and vices mr semple has also translated in a distinct volume the religion u s w the edition which i have used is that of kants whole works by rosenkranz and schubert vol viii of which contains the grundlegung and the kritik and vol x the religion for convenience of reference to the original i have given at the top of each page the corresponding pages of rosenkranz edition it is not very accurately printed and where the errors are obvious i have silently corrected them others i have vii noticed in footnotes many of these errors seem to have been handed down through all editions from the first hartensteins edition is more carefully revised and i have referred to it and to kirchmanns in cases of doubt kants grammatical errors partly provincialisms partly due to his age are usually corrected by hartenstein but silently which is a somewhat questionable proceeding in an editor amongst these errors are uncertainty in the use of the indicative and conjunctive an almost thoroughgoing misuse of prepositions hartenstein and irregularities in the gender of substantives his use of vor for für has been generally corrected by editors where vor remains the reader must remember that its retention is a matter of judgment i have to express my obligation to professor selss for his kindness in revising the proofs and for many valuable suggestions the memoir prefixed will it is hoped prove interesting in the present fourth edition some corrections have been made the portrait prefixed is from a photograph of an oilpainting in the possession of gräfe and unzer booksellers of königsberg it is inferior as a work of art to the portrait engraved in the former edition viii but as it represents kant in the vigour of his age and unlike the former has never appeared in any book readers will probably be pleased with the substitution i possess also a copy of a rare fulllength silhouette photographic copies of which can be supplied my notes are in square brackets ix xiii memoir of kant immanuel kant was born in königsberg on the nd of april thirteen years after hume and fourteen after reid his family was of scottish origin his grandfather having been one of the many scotchmen who emigrated from scotland at the end of the seventeenth century some settling in prussia and some in sweden and he is said to have been himself the first to change the spelling of the name from cant which he did in order to avoid the mispronunciation zant his father was a saddler in modest if not humble circumstances both parents were persons of simple and sincere piety kant himself although he did not sympathize with their religious views bears the strongest testimony to the practical effect of their religion on their life although said he speaking warmly the religious ideas of that time and the notions of what was called virtue and piety were far from being distinct and satisfactory yet such persons had the root of the matter in them let men decry pietism as they may the people who were in earnest with it were honourably distinguished they possessed the highest that man can possess—that calm that serenity that inward peace which is not disturbed by any passion no trouble no persecution dismayed them no contest had the power to stir xiv them up to anger or hostility in a word even the mere observer was involuntarily compelled to respect them i still remember added he how a quarrel once broke out between the harnessmakers and the saddlers about their respective privileges my father suffered considerably nevertheless even in conversation amongst his own family he spoke about this quarrel with such forbearance and love towards his opponents and with such firm trust in providence that although i was then only a boy i shall never forget it of his mother especially he ever retained a tender and grateful memory saying i shall never forget my mother for she planted and fostered the first germ of good in
