we search we shall find for all actions that are worthy of praise a law of duty which commands and does not leave us to choose what may be agreeable to our inclinations this is the only way of representing things that can give a moral training to the soul because it alone is capable of solid and accurately defined principles if fanaticism in its most general sense is a deliberate overstepping of the limits of human reason then moral fanaticism is such an overstepping of the bounds that practical pure reason sets to mankind in that it forbids us to place the subjective determining principle of correct actions that is their moral motive in anything but the law itself or to place the disposition which is thereby brought into the maxims in anything but respect for this law and hence commands us to take as the supreme vital principle of all morality in men the thought of duty which strikes down all arrogance as well as vain selflove if this is so it is not only writers of romance or sentimental educators although they may be zealous opponents of sentimentalism but sometimes even philosophers nay even the severest of all the stoics that have brought in moral fanaticism instead of a sober but wise moral discipline although the fanaticism of the latter was more heroic that of the former of an insipid effeminate character and we may without hypocrisy say of the moral teaching of the gospel that it first by the purity of its moral principle and at the same time by its suitability to the limitations of finite beings brought all the good conduct of men under the discipline of a duty plainly set before their eyes which does not permit them to indulge in dreams of imaginary moral perfections and that it also set the bounds of humility that is selfknowledge to selfconceit as well as to selflove both which are ready to mistake their limits 0 duty thou sublime and mighty name that dost embrace nothing charming or insinuating but requirest submission and yet seekest not to move the will by threatening aught that would arouse natural aversion or terror but merely holdest forth a law which of itself finds entrance into the mind and yet gains reluctant reverence though not always obedience a law before which all inclinations are dumb even though they secretly counterwork it what origin is there worthy of thee and where is to be found the root of thy noble descent which proudly rejects all kindred with the inclinations a root to be derived from which is the indispensable condition of the only worth which men can give themselves it can be nothing less than a power which elevates man above himself as a part of the world of sense a power which connects him with an order of things that only the understanding can conceive with a world which at the same time commands the whole sensible world and with it the empirically determinable existence of man in time as well as the sum total of all ends which totality alone suits such unconditional practical laws as the moral this power is nothing but personality that is freedom and independence on the mechanism of nature yet regarded also as a faculty of a being which is subject to special laws namely pure practical laws given by its own reason so that the person as belonging to the sensible world is subject to his own personality as belonging to the intelligible supersensible world it is then not to be wondered at that man as belonging to both worlds must regard his own nature in reference to its second and highest characteristic only with reverence and its laws with the highest respect on this origin are founded many expressions which designate the worth of objects according to moral ideas the moral law is holy inviolable man is indeed unholy enough but he must regard humanity in his own person as holy in all creation every thing one chooses and over which one has any power may be used merely as means man alone and with him every rational creature is an end in himself by virtue of the autonomy of his freedom he is the subject of the moral law which is holy just for this reason every will even every persons own individual will in relation to itself is restricted to the condition of agreement with the autonomy of the rational being that is to say that it is not to be subject to any purpose which can not accord with a law which might arise from the will of the passive subject himself the latter is therefore never to be employed merely as means but as itself also concurrently an end we justly attribute this condition even to the divine will with regard to the rational beings in the world which are his creatures since it rests on their personality by which alone they are ends in themselves this respectinspiring idea of personality which sets before our eyes the sublimity of our nature in its higher aspect while at the same time it shows us the want of accord of our conduct with it and thereby strikes down selfconceit is even natural to the commonest reason and easily observed has not every even moderately honourable man sometimes found that where by an otherwise inoffensive lie he might either have withdrawn himself from an unpleasant business or even have procured some advantages for a loved and welldeserving friend he has avoided it solely lest he should despise himself secretly in his own eyes when an upright man is in the greatest distress which he might have avoided if he could only have disregarded duty is he not sustained by the consciousness that he has maintained humanity in its proper dignity in his own person and honoured it that he has no reason to be ashamed of himself in his own
