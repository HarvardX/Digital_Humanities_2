determined by it an obligation they say that something would be good to do or to forbear but they say it to a will which does not always do a thing because it is conceived to be good to do it that is practically good however which determines the will by means of the conceptions of reason and consequently not from subjective causes but objectively that is on principles which are valid for every rational being as such it is distinguished from the pleasant as that which influences the will only by means of sensation from merely subjective causes valid only for the sense of this or that one and not as a principle of reason which holds for every one a perfectly good will would therefore be equally subject to objective laws viz laws of good but could not be conceived as obliged thereby to act lawfully because of itself from its subjective constitution it can only be determined by the conception of good therefore no imperatives hold for the divine will or in general for a holy will ought is here out of place because the volition is already of itself necessarily in unison with the law therefore imperatives are only formulæ to express the relation of objective laws of all volition to the subjective imperfection of the will of this or that rational being e g the human will now all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically the former represent the practical necessity of a possible action as means to something else that is willed or at least which one might possibly will the categorical imperative would be that which represented an action as necessary of itself without reference to another end ie as objectively necessary since every practical law represents a possible action as good and on this account for a subject who is practically determinable by reason necessary all imperatives are formulæ determining an action which is necessary according to the principle of a will good in some respects if now the action is good only as a means to something else then the imperative is hypothetical if it is conceived as good in itself and consequently as being necessarily the principle of a will which of itself conforms to reason then it is categorical thus the imperative declares what action possible by me would be good and presents the practical rule in relation to a will which does not forthwith perform an action simply because it is good whether because the subject does not always know that it is good or because even if it know this yet its maxims might be opposed to the objective principles of practical reason accordingly the hypothetical imperative only says that the action is good for some purpose possible or actual in the first case it is a problematical in the second an assertorial practical principle the categorical imperative which declares an action to be objectively necessary in itself without reference to any purpose ie without any other end is valid as an apodictic practical principle whatever is possible only by the power of some rational being may also be conceived as a possible purpose of some will and therefore the principles of action as regards the means necessary to attain some possible purpose are in fact infinitely numerous all sciences have a practical part consisting of problems expressing that some end is possible for us and of imperatives directing how it may be attained these may therefore be called in general imperatives of skill here there is no question whether the end is rational and good but only what one must do in order to attain it the precepts for the physician to make his patient thoroughly healthy and for a poisoner to ensure certain death are of equal value in this respect that each serves to effect its purpose perfectly since in early youth it can not be known what ends are likely to occur to us in the course of life parents seek to have their children taught a great many things and provide for their skill in the use of means for all sorts of arbitrary ends of none of which can they determine whether it may not perhaps hereafter be an object to their pupil but which it is at all events possible that he might aim at and this anxiety is so great that they commonly neglect to form and correct their judgment on the value of the things which may be chosen as ends 0 there is one end however which may be assumed to be actually such to all rational beings so far as imperatives apply to them viz as dependent beings and therefore one purpose which they not merely may have but which we may with certainty assume that they all actually have by a natural necessity and this is happiness the hypothetical imperative which expresses the practical necessity of an action as means to the advancement of happiness is assertorial we are not to present it as necessary for an uncertain and merely possible purpose but for a purpose which we may presuppose with certainty and à priori in every man because it belongs to his being now skill in the choice of means to his own greatest wellbeing may be called prudence in the narrowest sense and thus the imperative which refers to the choice of means to ones own happiness i e the precept of prudence is still always hypothetical the action is not commanded absolutely but only as means to another purpose finally there is an imperative which commands a certain conduct immediately without having as its condition any other purpose to be attained by it this imperative is categorical it concerns not the matter of the action or its intended result but its form and the principle of which it is itself a result and what is essentially good in it consists in the mental disposition let the consequence be what it may this
