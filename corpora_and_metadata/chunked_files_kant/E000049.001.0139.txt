of categories which contain nothing empirical such precaution is very desirable in all philosophy and yet is often neglected namely not to prejudge questions by adventuring definitions before the notion has been completely analysed which is often very late it may be observed through the whole course of the critical philosophy of the theoretical as well as the practical reason that frequent opportunity offers of supplying defects in the old dogmatic method of philosophy and of correcting errors which are not observed until we make such rational use of these notions viewing them as a whole i am more afraid in the present treatise of occasional misconception in respect of some expressions which i have chosen with the greatest care in order that the notion to which they point may not be missed thus in the table of categories of the practical reason under the title of modality the permitted and forbidden in a practical objective point of view possible and impossible have almost the same meaning in common language as the next category duty and contrary to duty here however the former means what coincides with or contradicts a merely possible practical precept for example the solution of all problems of geometry and mechanics the latter what is similarly related to a law actually present in the reason and this distinction is not quite foreign even to common language although somewhat unusual for example it is forbidden to an orator as such to forge new words or constructions in a certain degree this is permitted to a poet in neither case is there any question of duty for if anyone chooses to forfeit his reputation as an orator no one can prevent him we have here only to do with the distinction of imperatives into problematical assertorial and apodictic similarly in the note in which i have compared the moral ideas of practical perfection in different philosophical schools i have distinguished the idea of wisdom from that of holiness although i have stated that essentially and objectively they are the same but in that place i understand by the former only that wisdom to which man the stoic lays claim therefore i take it subjectively as an attribute alleged to belong to man perhaps the expression virtue with which also the stoic made great show would better mark the characteristic of his school the expression of a postulate of pure practical reason might give most occasion to misapprehension in case the reader confounded it with the signification of the postulates in pure mathematics which carry apodictic certainty with them these however postulate the possibility of an action the object of which has been previously recognised à priori in theory as possible and that with perfect certainty but the former postulates the possibility of an object itself god and the immortality of the soul from apodictic practical laws and therefore only for the purposes of a practical reason this certainty of the postulated possibility then is not at all theoretic and consequently not apodictic that is to say it is not a known necessity as regards the object but a necessary supposition as regards the subject necessary for the obedience to its objective but practical laws it is therefore merely a necessary hypothesis i could find no better expression for this rational necessity which is subjective but yet true and unconditional names that designate the followers of a sect have always been accompanied with much injustice just as if one said n is an idealist for although he not only admits but even insists that our ideas of external things have actual objects of external things corresponding to them yet he holds that the form of the intuition does not depend on them but on the human mind n is clearly kant himself the original has pure an obvious error literally to have a firm seat in any saddle it may be noted that kants father was a saddler not in the original text propositions which in mathematics or physics are called practical ought properly to be called technical for they have nothing to do with the determination of the will they only point out how a certain effect is to be produced and are therefore just as theoretical as any propositions which express the connexion of a cause with an effect now whoever chooses the effect must also choose the cause the original sentence is defective hartenstein supplies enthält reading empfindet instead of empfiehlt the original text is i think corrupt the original text has practical obviously an error by immanent kant means what is strictly confined within the limits of experience by transcendent what pretends to overpass these bounds cf kritik der reinen vernunft ed rosenkr p 0 meiklejohns transl p 0 is a verstandeswesen the original has practical clearly an error the verb indispensable to the sense is absent from the original text or immediately i e without reference to any ulterior result the original has objects objecte which makes no sense i have therefore ventured to correct it besides this the expression sub ratione boni is also ambiguous for it may mean we represent something to ourselves as good when and because we desire will it or we desire something because we represent it to ourselves as good so that either the desire determines the notion of the object as a good or the notion of good determines the desire the will so that in the first case sub ratione boni would mean we will something under the idea of the good in the second in consequence of this idea which as determining the volition must precede it the english language marks the distinction in question though not perfectly evil is not absolutely restricted to moral evil we speak also of physical evils but certainly when not so qualified it applies usually as an adjective perhaps exclusively to moral evil bad is more general but when used with a word connoting moral qualities it expresses moral
