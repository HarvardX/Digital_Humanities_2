applied to a holy being the objective necessity of actions from obligation is called duty from what has just been said it is easy to see how it happens that although the conception of duty implies subjection to the law we yet ascribe a certain dignity and sublimity to the person who fulfils all his duties there is not indeed any sublimity in him so far as he is subject to the moral law but inasmuch as in regard to that very law he is likewise a legislator and on that account alone subject to it he has sublimity we have also shown above that neither fear nor inclination but simply respect for the law is the spring which can give actions a moral worth our own will so far as we suppose it to act only under the condition that its maxims are potentially universal laws this ideal will which is possible to us is the proper object of respect and the dignity of humanity consists just in this capacity of being universally legislative though with the condition that it is itself subject to this same legislation the autonomy of the will as the supreme principle of morality autonomy of the will is that property of it by which it is a law to itself independently on any property of the objects of volition the principle of autonomy then is always so to choose that the same volition shall comprehend the maxims of our choice as a universal law we can not prove that this practical rule is an imperative ie that the will of every rational being is necessarily bound to it as a condition by a mere analysis of the conceptions which occur in it since it is a synthetical proposition we must advance beyond the cognition of the objects to a critical examination of the subject that is of the pure practical reason for this synthetic proposition which commands apodictically must be capable of being cognised wholly à priori this matter however does not belong to the present section but that the principle of autonomy in question is the sole principle of morals can be readily shown by mere analysis of the conceptions of morality for by this analysis we find that its principle must be a categorical imperative and that what this commands is neither more nor less than this very autonomy heteronomy of the will as the source of all spurious principles of morality if the will seeks the law which is to determine it anywhere else than in the fitness of its maxims to be universal laws of its own dictation consequently if it goes out of itself and seeks this law in the character of any of its objects there always results heteronomy the will in that case does not give itself the law but it is given by the object through its relation to the will this relation whether it rests on inclination or on conceptions of 0 reason only admits of hypothetical imperatives i ought to do something because i wish for something else on the contrary the moral and therefore categorical imperative says i ought to do so and so even though i should not wish for anything else ex gr the former says i ought not to lie if i would retain my reputation the latter says i ought not to lie although it should not bring me the least discredit the latter therefore must so far abstract from all objects that they shall have no influence on the will in order that practical reason will may not be restricted to administering an interest not belonging to it but may simply show its own commanding authority as the supreme legislation thus ex gr i ought to endeavour to promote the happiness of others not as if its realization involved any concern of mine whether by immediate inclination or by any satisfaction indirectly gained through reason but simply because a maxim which excludes it can not be comprehended as a universal law in one and the same volition classification of all principles of morality which can be founded on the conception of heteronomy here as elsewhere human reason in its pure use so long as it was not critically examined has first tried all possible wrong ways before it succeeded in finding the one true way all principles which can be taken from this point of view are either empirical or rational the former drawn from the principle of happiness are built on physical or moral feelings the latter drawn from the principle of perfection are built either on the rational conception of perfection as a possible effect or on that of an independent perfection the will of god as the determining cause of our will empirical principles are wholly incapable of serving as a foundation for moral laws for the universality with which these should hold for all rational beings without distinction the unconditional practical necessity which is thereby imposed on them is lost when their foundation is taken from the particular constitution of human nature or the accidental circumstances in which it is placed the principle of private happiness however is the most objectionable not merely because it is false and experience contradicts the supposition that prosperity is always proportioned to good conduct nor yet merely because it contributes nothing to the establishment of morality—since it is quite a different thing to make a prosperous man and a good man or to make one prudent and sharpsighted for his own interests and to make him virtuous—but because the springs it provides for morality are such as rather undermine it and destroy its sublimity since they put the motives to virtue and to vice in the same class and only teach us to make a better calculation the specific difference between virtue and vice being entirely extinguished on the other hand as to moral feeling this supposed special sense the appeal to it is indeed superficial when those
