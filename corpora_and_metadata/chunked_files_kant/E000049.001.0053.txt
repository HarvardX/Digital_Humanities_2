internal but intellectual compulsion in the supreme intelligence the elective will is rightly conceived as incapable of any maxim which could not at the same time be objectively a law and the notion of holiness which on that account belongs to it places it not indeed above all practical laws but above all pratically restrictive laws and consequently above obligation and duty this holiness of will is however a practical idea which must necessarily serve as a type to which finite rational beings can only approximate indefinitely and which the pure moral law which is itself on this account called holy constantly and rightly holds before their eyes the utmost that finite practical reason can effect is to be certain of this indefinite progress of ones maxims and of their steady disposition to advance this is virtue and virtue at least as a naturally acquired faculty can never be perfect because assurance in such a case never becomes apodictic certainty and when it only amounts to persuasion is very dangerous § viii — theorem iv the autonomy of the will is the sole principle of all moral laws and of all duties which conform to them on the other hand heteronomy of the elective will not only can not be the basis of any obligation but is on the contrary opposed to the principle thereof and to the morality of the will in fact the sole principle of morality consists in the independence on all matter of the law namely a desired object and in the determination of the elective will by the mere universal legislative form of which its maxim must be capable now this independence is freedom in the negative sense and this selflegislation of the pure and therefore practical reason is freedom in the positive sense thus the moral law expresses nothing else than the autonomy of the pure practical reason that is freedom and this is itself the formal condition of all maxims and on this condition only can they agree with the supreme practical law if therefore the matter of the volition which can be nothing else than the object of a desire that is connected with the law enters into the practical law as the condition of its possibility there results heteronomy of the elective will namely dependence on the physical law that we should follow some impulse or inclination in that case the will does not give itself the law but only the precept how rationally to follow pathological law and the maxim which in such a case never contains the universally legislative form not only produces no obligation but is itself opposed to the principle of a pure practical reason and therefore also to the moral disposition even though the resulting action may be conformable to the law remark i hence a practical precept which contains a material and therefore empirical condition must never be reckoned a practical law for the law of the pure will which is free brings the will into a sphere quite different from the empirical and as the necessity involved in the law is not a physical necessity it can only consist in the formal conditions of the possibility of a law in general all the matter of practical rules rests on subjective conditions which give them only a conditional universality in case i desire this or that what i must do in order to obtain it and they all turn on the principle of private happiness now it is indeed undeniable that every volition must have an object and therefore a matter but it does not follow that this is the determining principle and the condition of the maxim for if it is so then this can not be exhibited in a universally legislative form since in that case the expectation of the existence of the object would be the determining cause of the choice and the volition must presuppose the dependence of the faculty of desire on the existence of something but this dependence can only be sought in empirical conditions and therefore can never furnish a foundation for a necessary and universal rule thus the happiness of others may be the object of the will of a rational being but if it were the determining principle of the maxim we must assume that we find not only a rational satisfaction in the welfare of others but also a want such as the sympathetic disposition in some men occasions but i can not assume the existence of this want in every rational being not at all in god the matter then of the maxim may remain but it must not be the condition of it else the maxim could not be fit for a law hence the mere form of law which limits the matter must also be a reason for adding this matter to the will not for presupposing it for example let the matter be my own happiness this rule if i attribute it to everyone as in fact i may in the case of every finite being can become an objective practical law only if i include the happiness of others therefore the law that we should promote the happiness of others does not arise from the assumption that this is an object of everyones choice but merely from this that the form of universality which reason requires as the condition of giving to a maxim of selflove the objective validity of a law is the principle that determines the will therefore it was not the object the happiness of others that determined the pure will but it was the form of law only by which i restricted my maxim founded on inclination so as to give it the universality of a law and thus to adapt it to the practical reason and it is this restriction alone and not the adddition of an external spring that can give rise to the notion of the obligation to extend the maxim of my
