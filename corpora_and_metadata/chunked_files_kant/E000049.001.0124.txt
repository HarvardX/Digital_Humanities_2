have a subjective ground additional to personality and so this ground seems therefore to deserve the name of a capacity belonging to personality if we consider these three capacities according to the conditions of their possibility we find that the first requires no reason the second is based on reason which though practical is at the service of other motives the third has as its root reason which is practical of itself that is unconditionally legislative all these capacities in man are not only negatively good not resisting the moral law but are also capacities for good promoting obedience to it they are original for they appertain to the possibility of human nature man can use the two former contrary to their end but can not destory them by the capacities of a being we understand both its constituent elements and also the forms of their combination which make it such and such a being they are original if they are essentially necessary to the possibility of such a being contingent if the being would be in itself possible without them it is further to be observed that we are speaking here only of those capacities which have immediate reference to the faculty of desire and to the use of the elective will ii of the propensity to evil in human nature by propensity propensio i understand the subjective source of possibility of an inclination habitual desire concupiscentia so far as this latter is as regards man generally contingent it is distinguished from a capacity by this that although it may be innate it need not be conceived as such but may be regarded as acquired when it is good or when it is bad as drawn by the person on himself here however we are speaking only of the propensity to what is properly ie morally bad which as it is possible only as a determination of free elective will and this can be adjudged to be good or bad only by its maxims must consist in the subjective ground of the possibility of a deviation of the maxims from the moral law and if this propensity may be assumed as belonging to man universally and therefore to the characteristics of his race will be called a natural propensity of man to evil we may add further that the capability or incapability of the elective will to adopt the moral law into its maxims or not arising from natural propensity is called a good or bad heart we may conceive three distinct degrees of thisâ€”first it is the weakness of the human heart in following adopted maxims generally or the frailty of human nature secondly the propensity to mingle nonmoral motives with the moral even when it is done with a good purpose and under maxims of good that is impurity thirdly the propensity to adopt bad maxims that is the depravity of human nature or of the human heart first the frailty fragilitas of human nature is expressed even in the complaint of an apostle to will is present with me but how to perform i find not that is i adopt the good the law into the maxim of my elective will but this which objectively in its ideal conception in thesi is an irresistible spring is subjectively in hypothesi when the maxim is to be carried out weaker than inclination secondly the impurity impuritas improbitas of the human heart consists in this that although the maxim is good in its object the intended obedience to the law and perhaps also powerful enough for practice yet it is not purely moral that is does not as ought to be the case involve the law alone as its sufficient spring but frequently perhaps always has need of other springs beside it to determine the elective will to what duty demands in other words that dutiful actions are not done purely from duty thirdly the depravity vitiositas pravitas or if it is preferred the corruption corruptio of the human heart is the propensity of the elective will to maxims which prefer other not moral springs to that which arises from the moral law it may also be called the perversity perversitas of the human heart because it reverses the moral order in respect of the springs of a free elective will and although legally good actions may be consistent with this the moral disposition is thereby corrupted in its root and the man is therefore designated bad it will be remarked that the propensity to evil in man is here ascribed even to the best best in action which must be the case if it is to be proved that the propensity to evil amongst men is universal or what here signifies the same thing that it is interwoven with human nature however a man of good morals bene moratus and a morally good man moraliter bonus do not differ or at least ought not to differ as regards the agreement of their actions with the law only that in the one these actions have not always the law for their sole and supreme spring in the other it is invariably so we may say of the former that he obeys the law in the letter that is as far as the act is concerned which the law commands but of the latter that he observes it in the spirit the spirit of the moral law consists in this that it is alone an adequate spring whatever is not done from this faith is sin in the disposition of mind for if other springs beside the law itself are necessary to determine the elective will to actions conforming to the law ex gr desire of esteem selflove in general or even goodnatured instinct such as compassion then it is a mere accident that they agree with the law for they might just as well urge to its transgression the maxim then the goodness of which is the measure of
