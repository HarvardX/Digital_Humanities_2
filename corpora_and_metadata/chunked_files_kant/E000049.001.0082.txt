could not however make a similar step as regards the second dynamical idea namely that of a necessary being we could not rise to it from the sensible world without the aid of the first dynamical idea for if we attempted to do so we should have ventured to leave at a bound all that is given to us and to leap to that of which nothing is given us that can help us to effect the connexion of such a supersensible being with the world of sense since the necessary being would have to be known as given outside ourselves on the other hand it is now obvious that this connexion is quite possible in relation to our own subject inasmuch as i know myself to be on the one side as an intelligible supersensible being determined by the moral law by means of freedom and on the other side as acting in the world of sense it is the concept of freedom alone that enables us to find the unconditioned and intelligible supersensible for the conditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves for it is our own reason that by means of the supreme and unconditional practical law knows that itself and the being that is conscious of this law our own person belongs to the pure world of understanding and moreover defines the manner in which as such it can be active in this way it can be understood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason only that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us knowledge of a supersensible order and connexion which however 0 for this very reason can not be extended further than is necessary for pure practical purposes let me be permitted on this occasion to make one more remark namely that every step that we make with pure reason even in the practical sphere where no attention is paid to subtile speculation nevertheless accords with all the material points of the critique of the theoretical reason as closely and directly as if each step had been thought out with deliberate purpose to establish this confirmation such a thorough agreement wholly unsought for and quite obvious as any one can convince himself if he will only carry moral inquiries up to their principles between the most important propositions of practical reason and the often seemingly too subtile and needless remarks of the critique of the speculative reason occasions surprise and astonishment and confirms the maxim already recognized and praised by others namely that in every scientific inquiry we should pursue our way steadily with all possible exactness and frankness without caring for any objections that may be raised from outside its sphere but as far as we can to carry out our inquiry truthfully and completely by itself frequent observation has convinced me that when such researches are concluded that which in one part of them appeared to me very questionable 0 considered in relation to other extraneous doctrines when i left this doubtfulness out of sight for a time and only attended to the business in hand until it was completed at last was unexpectedly found to agree perfectly with what had been discovered separately without the least regard to those doctrines and without any partiality or prejudice for them authors would save themselves many errors and much labour lost because spent on a delusion if they could only resolve to go to work with more frankness 0 book ii dialectic of pure practical reason chapter i of a dialectic of pure practical reason generally pure reason always has its dialectic whether it is considered in its speculative or its practical employment for it requires the absolute totality of the conditions of what is given conditioned and this can only be found in things in themselves but as all conceptions of things in themselves must be referred to intuitions and with us men these can never be other than sensible and hence can never enable us to know objects as things in themselves but only as appearances and since the unconditioned can never be found in this chain of appearances which consists only of conditioned and conditions thus from applying this rational idea of the totality of the conditions in other words of the unconditioned to appearances there arises an inevitable illusion as if these latter were things in themselves for in the absence of a warning critique they are always regarded as such this illusion would never be noticed as delusive if it did not betray itself by a conflict of reason with itself when it applies to appearances its fundamental principle of presupposing the unconditioned to everything conditioned by this however reason is compelled to trace this illusion to its source and search how it can be removed and this can only be done by a complete critical examination of the whole pure faculty of reason so that the 0 antinomy of the pure reason which is manifest in its dialectic is in fact the most beneficial error into which human reason could never have fallen since it at last drives us to search for the key to escape from this labyrinth and when this key is found it further discovers that which we did not seek but yet had need of namely a view into a higher and an immutable order of things in which we even now are and in which we are thereby enabled by definite precepts to continue to live according to the highest dictates of reason it may be seen in detail in the critique of pure reason how in its speculative employment this natural dialectic is to be solved and how the error which arises from a very natural illusion may be guarded against but reason in its practical use is not a whit better off as pure practical reason it likewise seeks to find the unconditioned for the practically conditioned which rests
