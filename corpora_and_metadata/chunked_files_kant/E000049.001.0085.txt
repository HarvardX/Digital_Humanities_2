not rest on any empirical principle it follows that the deduction legitimation of this concept must be transcendental it is à priori morally necessary to produce the summum bonum by freedom of will therefore the condition of its possibility must rest solely on à priori principles of cognition i —the antinomy of practical reason in the summum bonum which is practical for us i e to be realised by our will virtue and happiness are thought as necessarily combined so that the one can not be assumed by pure practical reason without the other also being attached to it now this combination like every other is either analytical or synthetical it has been shown that it can not be analytical it must then be synthetical and more particularly must be conceived as the connexion of cause and effect since it concerns a practical good i e one that is possible by means of action consequently either the desire of happiness must be the motive to maxims of virtue or the maxim of virtue must be the efficient cause of happiness the first is absolutely impossible because as was proved in the analytic maxims which place the determining principle of the will in the desire of personal happiness are not moral at all and no virtue can be founded on them but the second is also impossible because the practical connexion of causes and effects in the world as the result of the determination of the will does not 0 depend upon the moral dispositions of the will but on the knowledge of the laws of nature and the physical power to use them for ones purposes consequently we can not expect in the world by the most punctilious observance of the moral laws any necessary connexion of happiness with virtue adequate to the summum bonum now as the promotion of this summum bonum the conception of which contains this connexion is à priori a necessary object of our will and inseparably attached to the moral law the impossibility of the former must prove the falsity of the latter if then the supreme good is not possible by practical rules then the moral law also which commands us to promote it is directed to vain imaginary ends and must consequently be false ii —critical solution of the antinomy of practical reason the antinomy of pure speculative reason exhibits a similar conflict between freedom and physical necessity in the causality of events in the world it was solved by showing that there is no real contradiction when the events and even the world in which they occur are regarded as they ought to be merely as appearances since one and the same acting being as an appearance even to his own inner sense has a causality in the world of sense that always conforms to the mechanism of nature but with respect to the same events so far as the acting person regards himself at the same time as a noumenon as pure intelligence in an existence not dependent on the condition of time he can contain a principle by which that causality acting according to laws of nature is determined but which is itself free from all laws of nature it is just the same with the foregoing antinomy of pure practical reason the first of the two propositions—that the endeavour after happiness produces a virtuous mind is absolutely false but the second that a virtuous mind necessarily produces happiness is not absolutely false but only in so far as virtue is considered as a form of causality in the sensible world and consequently only if i suppose existence in it to be the only sort of existence of a rational being it is then only conditionally false but as i am not only justified in thinking that i exist also as a noumenon in a world of the understanding but even have in the moral law a purely intellectual determining principle of my causality in the sensible world it is not impossible that morality of mind should have a connexion as cause with happiness as an effect in the sensible world if not immediate yet mediate viz through an intelligent author of nature and moreover necessary while in a system of nature which is merely an object of the senses this combination could never occur except contingently and therefore could not suffice for the summum bonum thus notwithstanding this seeming conflict of practical reason with itself the summum bonum which is the necessary supreme end of a will morally determined is a true object thereof for it is practically possible and the maxims of the will which as regards their matter refer to it have objective reality which at first was threatened by the antinomy that appeared in the connexion of morality with happiness by a general law but this was merely from a misconception because the relation between appearances was taken for a relation of the things in themselves to these appearances when we find ourselves obliged to go so far namely to the connexion with an intelligible world to find the possibility of the summum bonum which reason points out to all rational beings as the goal of all their moral wishes it must seem strange that nevertheless the philosophers both of ancient and modern times have been able to find happiness in accurate proportion to virtue even in this life in the sensible world or have persuaded themselves that they were conscious thereof for epicurus as well as the stoics extolled above everything the happiness that springs from the consciousness of living virtuously and the former was not so base in his practical precepts as one might infer from the principles of his theory which he used for explanation and not for action or as they were interpreted by many who were misled by his using the term pleasure for contentment on the contrary he reckoned the most disinterested practice of good amongst the ways of enjoying
