of pure practical reason or not does not depend at all on the comparison with our physical power and the question is only whether we should will an action that is directed to the existence of an object if the object were in our power hence the previous question is only as to the moral possibility of the action for in this case it is not the object but the law of the will that is the determining principle of the action the only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil for by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason by the latter one necessarily shunned also according to a principle of reason if the notion of good is not to be derived from an antecedent practical law but on the contrary is to serve as its foundation it can only be the notion of something whose existence promises pleasure and thus determines the causality of the subject to produce it that is to say determines the faculty of desire now since it is impossible to discern à priori what idea will be accompanied with pleasure and what with pain it will depend on experience alone to find out what is primarily good or evil the property of the subject with reference to which alone this experiment can be made is the feeling of pleasure and pain a receptivity belonging to the internal sense thus that only would be primarily good with which the sensation of pleasure is immediately connected and that simply evil which immediately excites pain since however this is opposed even to the usage of language which distinguishes the pleasant from the good the unpleasant from the evil and requires that good and evil shall always be judged by reason and therefore by concepts which can be communicated to everyone and not by mere sensation which is limited to individual subjects and their susceptibility and since nevertheless pleasure or pain can not be connected with any idea of an object à priori the philosopher who thought himself obliged to make a feeling of pleasure the foundation of his practical judgments would call that good which is a means to the pleasant and evil what is a cause of unpleasantness and pain for the judgment on the relation of means to ends certainly belongs to reason but although reason is alone capable of discerning the connexion of means with their ends so that the will might even be defined as the faculty of ends since these are always determining principles of the desires yet the practical maxims which would follow from the aforesaid principle of the good being merely a means would never contain as the object of the will anything good in itself but only something good for something the good would always be merely the useful and that for which it is 0 useful must always lie outside the will in sensation now if this as a pleasant sensation were to be distinguished from the notion of good then there would be nothing primarily good at all but the good would have to be sought only in the means to something else namely some pleasantness it is an old formula of the schools nihil appetimus nisi sub ratione boni nihil aversamur nisi sub ratione mali and it is used often correctly but often also in a manner injurious to philosophy because the expressions boni and mali are ambiguous owing to the poverty of language in consequence of which they admit a double sense and therefore inevitably bring the practical laws into ambiguity and philosophy which in employing them becomes aware of the different meanings in the same word but can find no special expressions for them is driven to subtile distinctions about which there is subsequently no unanimity because the distinction could not be directly marked by any suitable expression the german language has the good fortune to possess expressions which do not allow this difference to be overlooked it possesses two very distinct concepts and especially distinct expressions for that which the latins express by a single word bonum for bonum it has das gute good and das wohl well weal for malum das böse evil and das übel ill bad or das weh woe so that we express two quite distinct judgments when we consider in an action the good and evil of it or our weal and woe ill hence it already follows that the above quoted psychological proposition is at least very doubtful if it is translated we desire nothing except with a view to our weal or woe on the other hand if we render it thus under the direction of reason we desire nothing except so far as we esteem it good or evil it is indubitably certain and at the same time quite clearly expressed well or ill always implies only a reference to our condition as pleasant or unpleasant as one of pleasure or pain and if we desire or avoid an object on this account it is only so far as it is referred to our sensibility and to the feeling of pleasure or pain that it produces but good or evil always implies a reference to the will as determined by the law of reason to make something its object 0 for it is never determined directly by the object and the idea of it but is a faculty of taking a rule of reason for the motive of an action by which an object may be realized good and evil therefore are properly referred to actions not to the sensations of the person and if anything is to be good or evil absolutely i e in every respect and without any further condition or is to be so esteemed it can only be the manner of acting the maxim of the will and consequently the acting person himself as a good or evil man
