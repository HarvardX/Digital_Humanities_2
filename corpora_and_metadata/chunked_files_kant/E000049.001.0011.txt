equal to another that other is equal to it whatever relation or proportion one man in any case bears to another the same that other when put in like circumstances bears to him whatever i judge reasonable or unreasonable for another to do for me that by the same judgment i declare reasonable or unreasonable that i in the like case should do for him kants rule is a generalization of this so as to include duties to ourselves as well as to others as such it has a real scientific value practically its value liii consists like that of the golden rule in the elimination of inward dishonesty mr mills criticism on kants formula is that when we speak of a maxim being fit to be a universal law it is obvious that some test of fitness is required and that kant in fact tests the maxims by their consequences as if the whole gist of kants argument were not that the only test of this fitness is logical possibility or as if this were not the one thing expressed in his formula as to testing maxims by consequences he does so in the same sense in which euclid in indirect demonstrations tests a hypothesis by its consequences and in no other i e by the logical consequences not the practical take the case of a promise in kants view the argument against the law permitting unfaithfulness is not that it would be attended with consequences injurious to society but that it would annihilate all promises the present included and therefore annihilate itself of inconvenience to society not a word is said or implied hence kants objection rests wholly on the absolute universality of the supposed law whereas the utilitarian objection from practical consequences would be applicable in a proportionate degree to a law not supposed universal hence also kants test would hold even if the present promise were never to be followed by another nay it would be of equal force even though it should be proved that it would be better for society that there should be no verbal promises it has been said that in applying kants formula liv we must qualify it by introducing the consideration of the probability that our example or rule will be generally followed and the instance of celibacy has been suggested which it is said would be necessarily condemned as a crime if tested by kants rule pure and simple for if all men practised celibacy there would be an end of the race and on the greatest happiness principle to effect this would be the worst of crimes now if a qualification were required or admissible kants formula would be deprived of all scientific significance and its application made dependent on private and uncertain opinion as to the example of celibacy kant has himself indicated how he would dispose of it by the way in which he treats suicide he does not show its unlawfulness by alleging that if everyone committed suicide the human race would come to an end but by exposing the inconsistency in the principle of action which would lead to suicide in every case it is the mental principle which is to be tested not the mere external action bearing this in mind we shall find no difficulty in the case of celibacy it may proceed from motives which there would be no absurdity in supposing universal because the circumstances which give them this particular direction could only be exceptional but suppose celibacy recommended on grounds which are in their own nature universal eg as a condition of moral perfection then kants formula would properly lv apply for moral perfection is an end to be aimed at by all one might just as well say that kants rule would make all killing criminal whereas kant would obviously require us to take into account the motive selfdefence or other on the other hand apply mr sidgwicks qualification and what would result why that we might innocently kill provided the action were not likely to be generally imitated if occasional celibacy is justified only because there exists a natural passion which is sure to be usually powerful enough to prevent the example being followed then we may equally justify occasional violence or murder on the ground that fear or benevolence will naturally prevent the action from being extensively imitated kants view of the source of obligation in the autonomy of the will appears to require qualification if we would avoid a contradiction a law must be above the nature to which it is a law and which is subject to it a being which gave itself the moral law and whose freedom therefore is autonomy would not be conscious of obligation or duty since the moral law would coincide with its will kant draws the apparently selfcontradictory conclusion that we though willing the law yet resist it even if this be granted it would follow not that we should feel obliged but that either no action at all would follow or the more powerful side would prevail that we condemn ourselves when we have violated the law is an important fact on which kant very strongly insists but which his theory fails to explain is it not a far simpler and truer explanation to say that this selfcondemnation this humiliation in the presence of an unbending judge is a proof that we have not given ourselves the law lvi that we are subjects of a higher power there is indeed a sense in which autonomy may be truly vindicated to man the moral law is not a mere precept imposed upon us from without nor is it forced upon us by our sensitive nature it is a law prescribed to us or more correctly speaking revealed to us by our own reason but reason is not our own in the sense in which our appetites or sensations are our own it is not under our own control
