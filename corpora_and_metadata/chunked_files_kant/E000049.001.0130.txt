it is then only the restoration of its purity as the supreme principle of all our maxims by which it is adopted into these not merely in combination with other springs or as subordinate to these the inclinations as conditions but in its entire purity as a spring sufficient of itself to determine the elective will the original good is holiness of maxims in following ones duty by which the man who adopts this purity into his maxims although he is not himself as yet on that account holy for there is still a long interval between maxim and act nevertheless is on the way to approximate to holiness by an endless progress firmness of purpose in following duty when it has become a habit is called also virtue as far as legality is concerned which is its empirical character virtus phenomenon it has then the steady maxim of conformity of actions to the law whatever may be the source of the spring required for this hence virtue in this sense is gradually acquired and is described by some as a long practice in observing the law by which a man has passed from the propensity to vice by gradual reform of his conduct and strengthening of his maxims into an opposite propensity this does not require any change of heart but only a change of morals a man regards himself as virtuous when he feels himself confirmed in the maxims of observance of duty although this be not from the supreme principle of all maxims but the intemperate man for instance returns to temperance for the sake of health the liar to truth for the sake of reputation the unjust man to common fairness for the sake of peace or of gain c all on the muchlauded principle of happiness but that a man should become not merely a legally but a morally good godpleasing man that is virtuous in his intelligible character virtus noumenon a man who when he recognises a thing as his duty needs no other spring than this conception of duty itself this is not to be effected by gradual reform as long as the principle of his maxims remains impure but requires a revolution in the mind a transition to the maxim of holiness of mind and he can only become a new man by a kind of new birth as it were by a new creation gospel of john iii compared with gen i and a change of heart but if a man is corrupt in the very foundation of his maxims how is it possible that he should effect this revolution by his own power and become a good man of himself and yet duty commands it and duty commands nothing that is not practicable for us the only way this difficulty can be got over is that a revolution is necessary for the mental disposition but a gradual reform for the sensible temperament which opposes obstacles to the former and being necessary must therefore be possible that is when a man reverses the ultimate principle of his maxims by which he is a bad man by a single immutable resolution and in so doing puts on a new man then so far he is in principle and disposition a subject susceptible of good but it is only in continued effort and growth that he is a good man that is he may hope with such purity of the principle that he has taken as the supreme maxim of his elective will and by its stability that he is on the good though narrow road of a constant progress from bad to better in the eyes of one who penetrates the intelligible principle of the heart of all maxims of elective will and to whom therefore this endless progress is a unity that is in the eyes of god this comes to the same as being actually a good man pleasing to him and in so far this change may be considered as a revolution but in the judgment of men who can estimate themselves and the strength of their maxims only by the superiority which they gain over sensibility in time it is only to be viewed as an ever continuing struggle for improvement in other words as a gradual reform of the perverse disposition the propensity to evil hence it follows that the moral culture of man must begin not with improvement in morals but with a transformation of the mind and the foundation of a character although men usually proceed otherwise and contend against vices singly leaving the general root of them untouched now even a man of the most limited intellect is capable of the impression of an increased respect for an action conformable to duty in proportion as he withdraws from it in thought all other springs which could have influenced the maxim of the action by means of selflove and even children are capable of finding out even the least trace of a mixture of spurious springs of action in which case the action instantly loses all moral worth in their eyes this capacity for good is admirably cultivated by adducing the example of even good men good as regards their conformity to law and allowing ones moral pupils to estimate the impurity of many maxims from the actual springs of their actions and it gradually passes over into the character so that duty simply of itself commences to acquire considerable weight in their hearts but to teach them to admire virtuous actions however great the sacrifice they may cost is not the right way to maintain the feeling of the pupil for moral good for however virtuous anyone may be all the good he can ever do is only duty and to do his duty is no more than to do what is in the common moral order and therefore does not deserve to be admired on the contrary this admiration is a lowering of
