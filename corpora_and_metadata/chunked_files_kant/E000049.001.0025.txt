imperative may be called that of morality there is a marked distinction also between the volitions on these three sorts of principles in the dissimilarity of the obligation of the will in order to mark this difference more clearly i think they would be most suitably named in their order if we said they are either rules of skill or counsels of prudence or commands laws of morality for it is law only that involves the conception of an unconditional and objective necessity which is consequently universally valid and commands are laws which must be obeyed that is must be followed even in opposition to inclination counsels indeed involve necessity but one which can only hold under a contingent subjective condition viz they depend on whether this or that man reckons this or that as part of his happiness the categorical imperative on the contrary is not limited by any condition and as being absolutely although practically necessary may be quite properly called a command we might also call the first kind of imperatives technical belonging to art the second pragmatic to welfare the third moral belonging to free conduct generally that is to morals now arises the question how are all these imperatives possible this question does not seek to know how we can conceive the accomplishment of the action which the imperative ordains but merely how we can conceive the obligation of the will which the imperative expresses no special explanation is needed to show how an imperative of skill is possible whoever wills the end wills also so far as reason decides his conduct the means in his power which are indispensably necessary thereto this proposition is as regards the volition analytical for in willing an object as my effect there is already thought the causality of myself as an acting cause that is to say the use of the means and the imperative educes from the conception of volition of an end the conception of actions necessary to this end synthetical propositions must no doubt be employed in defining the means to a proposed end but they do not concern the principle the act of the will but the object and its realization ex gr that in order to bisect a line on an unerring principle i must draw from its extremities two interesecting ares this no doubt is taught by mathematics only in synthetical propositions but if i know that it is only by this process that the intended operation can be performed then to say that if i fully will the operation i also will the action required for it is an analytical proposition for it is one and the same thing to conceive something as an effect which i can produce in a certain way and to conceive myself as acting in this way if it were only equally easy to give a definite conception of happiness the imperatives of prudence would correspond exactly with those of skill and would likewise be analytical for in this case as in that it could be said whoever wills the end wills also according to the dictate of reason necessarily the indispensable means thereto which are in his power but unfortunately the notion of happiness is so indefinite that although every man wishes to attain it yet he never can say definitely and consistently what it is that he really wishes and wills the reason of this is that all the elements which belong to the notion of happiness are altogether empirical ie they must be borrowed from experience and nevertheless the idea of happiness requires an absolute whole a maximum of welfare in my present and all future circumstances now it is impossible that the most clearsighted and at the same time most powerful being supposed finite should frame to himself a definite conception of what he really wills in this does he will riches how much anxiety envy and snares might he not thereby draw upon his shoulders does he will knowledge and discernment perhaps it might prove to be only an eye so much the sharper to show him so much the more fearfully the evils that are now concealed from him and that can not be avoided or to impose more wants on his desires which already give him concern enough would he have long life who guarantees to him that it would not be a long misery would he at least have health how often has uneasiness of the body restrained from excesses into which perfect health would have allowed one to fall and so on in short he is unable on any principle to determine with certainty what would make him truly happy because to do so he would need to be omniscient we can not therefore act on any definite principles to secure happiness but only on empirical counsels ex gr of regimen frugality courtesy reserve c which experience teaches do on the average most promote wellbeing hence it follows that the imperatives of prudence do not strictly speaking command at all that is they can not present actions objectively as practically necessary that they are rather to be regarded as counsels consilia than precepts pr√¶cepta of reason that the problem to determine certainly and universally what action would promote the happiness of a rational being is completely insoluble and consequently no imperative respecting it is possible which should in the strict sense command to do what makes happy because happiness is not an ideal of reason but of imagination resting solely on empirical grounds and it is vain to expect that these should define an action by which one could attain the totality of a series of consequences which is really endless this imperative of prudence would however be an analytical proposition if we assume that the means to happiness could be certainly assigned for it is distinguished from the imperative of skill only by this that in the latter the end is merely possible in the former
