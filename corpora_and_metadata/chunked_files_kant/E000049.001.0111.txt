is with law ethics on the contrary supplies us with a matter an object of the free elective will an end of pure reason which is at the same time conceived as an objectively necessary end i e as duty for all men for as the sensible inclinations mislead us to ends which are the matter of the elective will that may contradict duty the legislating reason can not otherwise guard against their influence than by an opposite moral end which therefore must be given à priori independently on inclination an end is an object of the elective will of a rational being by the idea of which this will is determined to an action for the production of this object now i may be forced by others to actions which are directed to an end as means but i can not be forced to have an end i can only make something an end to myself if however i am also bound to make something which lies in the notions of practical reason an end to myself and therefore besides the formal determining principle of the elective will as contained in law to have also a material principle an end which can be opposed to the end derived from sensible impulses then this gives the notion of an end which is in itself a duty the doctrine of this can not belong to jurisprudence but to ethics since this alone includes in its conception selfconstraint according to moral laws for this reason ethics may also be defined as the system of the ends of the pure practical reason the two parts of moral philosophy are distinguished as treating respectively of ends and of duties of constraint that ethics contains duties to the observance of which one can not be physically forced by others is merely the consequence of this that it is a doctrine of ends since to be forced to have ends or to set them before ones self is a contradiction now that ethics is a doctrine of virtue doctrina officiorum virtutis follows from the definition of virtue given above compared with the obligation the peculiarity of which has just been shown there is in fact no other determination of the elective will except that to an end which in the very notion of it implies that i can not even physically be forced to it by the elective will of others another may indeed force me to do something which is not my end but only means to the end of another but he can not force me to make it my own end and yet i can have no end except of my own making the latter supposition would be a contradiction—an act of freedom which yet at the same time would not be free but there is no contradiction in setting before ones self an end which is also a duty for in this case i constrain myself and this is quite consistent with freedom but how is such an end possible that is now the question for the possibility of the notion of the thing viz that it is not selfcontradictory is not enough to prove the possibility of the thing itself the objective reality of the notion ii —exposition of the notion of an end which is also a duty we can conceive the relation of end to duty in two ways either starting from the end to find the maxim of the dutiful actions or conversely setting out from this to find the end which is also duty jurisprudence proceeds in the former way it is left to every ones free elective will what end he will choose for his action but its maxim is determined à priori namely that the freedom of the agent must be consistent with the freedom of every other according to a universal law ethics however proceeds in the opposite way it can not start from the ends which the man may propose to himself and hence give directions as to the maxims he should adopt that is as to his duty for that would be to take empirical principles of maxims and these could not give any notion of duty since this the categorical ought has its root in pure reason alone indeed if the maxims were to be adopted in accordance with those ends which are all selfish we could not properly speak of the notion of duty at all hence in ethics the notion of duty must lead to ends and must on moral principles give the foundation of maxims with respect to the ends which we ought to propose to ourselves setting aside the question what sort of end that is which is in itself a duty and how such an end is possible it is here only necessary to show that a duty of this kind is called a duty of virtue and why it is so called to every duty corresponds a right of action facultas moralis generatim but all duties do not imply a corresponding right facultas juridica of another to compel any one but only the duties called legal duties similarly to all ethical obligation corresponds the notion of virtue but it does not follow that all ethical duties are duties of virtue those in fact are not so which do not concern so much a certain end matter object of the elective will but merely that which is formal in the moral determination of the will ex gr that the dutiful action must also be done from duty it is only an end which is also duty that can be called a duty of virtue hence there are several of the latter kind and thus there are distinct virtues on the contrary there is only one duty of the former kind but it is one which is valid for all actions only one virtuous disposition the duty of virtue is essentially distinguished from the duty of justice
