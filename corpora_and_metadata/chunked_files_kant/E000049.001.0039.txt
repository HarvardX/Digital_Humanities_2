actions as belonging to the sensible world must be viewed as determined by other phenomena namely desires and inclinations if therefore i were only a member of the world of understanding then all my actions would perfectly conform to the principle of autonomy of the pure will if i were only a part of the world of sense they would necessarily be assumed to conform wholly to the natural law of desires and inclinations in other words to the heteronomy of nature the former would rest on morality as the supreme principle the latter on happiness since however the world of understanding contains the foundation of the world of sense and consequently of its laws also and accordingly gives the law to my will which belongs wholly to the world of understanding directly and must be conceived as doing so it follows that although on the one side i must regard myself as a being belonging to the world of sense yet on the other side i must recognise myself as subject as an intelligence to the law of the world of understanding ie to reason which contains this law in the idea of freedom and therefore as subject to the autonomy of the will consequently i must regard the laws of the world of understanding as imperatives for me and the actions which conform to them as duties and thus what makes categorical imperatives possible is this that the idea of freedom makes me a member of an intelligible world in consequence of which if i were nothing else all my actions would always conform to the autonomy of the will but as i at the same time intuite myself as a member of the world of sense they ought so to conform and this categorical ought implies a synthetic à priori proposition inasmuch as besides my will as affected by sensible desires there is added further the idea of the same will but as belonging to the world of the understanding pure and practical of itself which contains the supreme condition according to reason of the former will precisely as to the intuitions of sense there are added concepts of the understanding which of themselves signify nothing but regular form in general and in this way synthetic à priori propositions become possible on which all knowledge of physical nature rests the practical use of common human reason confirms this reasoning there is no one not even the most consummate villain provided only that he is otherwise accustomed to the use of reason who when we set before him examples of honesty of purpose of steadfastness in following good maxims of sympathy and general benevolence even combined with great sacrifices of advantages and comfort does not wish that he might also possess these qualities only on account of his inclinations and impulses he can not attain this in himself but at the same time he wishes to be free from such inclinations which are bundensome to himself he proves by this that he transfers himself in thought with a will free from the impulses of the sensibility into an order of things wholly different from that of his desires in the field of the sensibility since he can not expect to obtain by that wish any gratification of his desires nor any position which would satisfy any of his actual or supposable inclinations for this would destroy the preeminence of the very idea which wrests that wish from him he can only expect a greater intrinsic worth of his own person this better person however he imagines himself to be when he transfers himself to the point of view of a member of the world of the understanding to which he is involuntarily forced by the idea of freedom ie of independence on determining causes of the world of sense and from this point of view he is conscious of a good will which by his own confession constitutes the law for the bad will that he possesses as a member of the world of sense—a law whose authority he recognises while transgressing it what he morally ought is then what he necessarily would as a member of the world of the understanding and is conceived by him as an ought only inasmuch as he likewise considers himself as a member of the world of sense on the extreme limits of all practical philosophy all men attribute to themselves freedom of will hence come all judgments upon actions as being such as ought to have been done although they have not been done however this freedom is not a conception of experience nor can it be so since it still remains 0 even though experience shows the contrary of what on supposition of freedom are conceived as its necessary consequences on the other side it is equally necessary that everything that takes place should be fixedly determined according to laws of nature this necessity of nature is likewise not an empirical conception just for this reason that it involves the motion of necessity and consequently of à priori cognition but this conception of a system of nature is confirmed by experience and it must even be inevitably presupposed if experience itself is to be possible that is a connected knowledge of the objects of sense resting on general laws therefore freedom is only an idea ideal conception of reason and its objective reality in itself is doubtful while nature is a concept of the understanding which proves and must necessarily prove its reality in examples of experience there arises from this a dialectic of reason since the freedom attributed to the will appears to contradict the necessity of nature and placed between these two ways reason for speculative purposes finds the road of physical necessity much more beaten and more appropriate than that of freedom yet for practical purposes the narrow footpath of freedom is the only one on which it is possible to make use of reason in
