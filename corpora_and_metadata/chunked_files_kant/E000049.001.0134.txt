law there is no casus necessitatis except in the case where an unconditional duty conflicts with a duty which though perhaps great is yet conditional e g if the question is about preserving the state from disaster by betraying a person who stands towards another in a relation such as for example that of father and son to save the state from harm is an unconditional duty to save an individual is only a conditional duty namely provided he has not been guilty of a crime against the state the information given to the authorities may be given with the greatest reluctance but it is given under pressure namely moral necessity but if a shipwrecked man thrusts another from his plank in order to save his own life and it is said that he had the right of necessity i e physical necessity to do so this is wholly false for to maintain my own life is only a conditional duty viz if it can be done without crime but it is an unconditional duty not to take the life of another who does not injure me nay does not even bring me into peril of losing it however the teachers of general civil right proceed quite consistently in admitting this right of necessity for the sovereign power could not connect any punishment with the prohibition for this punishment would necessarily be death but it would be an absurd law that would threaten death to a man if when in danger he did not voluntarily submit to death—from das mag in der theorie richtig seyn u s w rosenkr vii p the two cases here considered were probably suggested by cicero who quotes them from hecato a disciple of panætius—de off iii printed by ponsonby and weldrick dublin i e religion so far as it lies within the limits of reason alone not pure reason as some german and perhaps all english writers on the history of philosophy have it kant himself indeed writes reiner in one place p 0 note but this is doubtless a slip if not a printers error slips of the same kind are frequent us my footnotes show so marked in kans first edition the circumstances are worth recording here this friend had fallen into a fever in consequence of being abandoned by her betrothed lover to whom she was deeply attached she could not be induced to swallow the nauseous draughts prescribed for her and kants mother who nursed her having failed in her attempt at persuasion thought to succeed by setting the example of taking the medicine herself when she had done so she was seized with nausea and shivering and at the same time observing spots on her friends body which she took for feverspots or petechiæ her imagination was excited thinking that she had caught the infection she was seized with fever the same day and died a few days after see an essay by the present writer on the theory of the tides in the philosophical magazine january 0 february and january and in the quarterly journal of mathematics march and on the amount of the retardation hermathena these essays have now been published in a volume kant subsequently thought of another cause which might operate in the opposite direction viz the condensation of the interior parts of the earth he did not however publish the suggestion i do not suppose it likely that laplace should have seen kants anonymous book but it must be remembered that kant mentioned his theory in several publications and probably referred to it in his lectures kant assumed too hastily that keplers third law applies to the particles of the ring which amounts to supposing that their mutual disturbances are negligible yet considering the form of the rings this is not a violent hypothesis phys geogr p wrights work was entitled an original theory or a new hypothesis of the universe founded on the laws of nature by thomas wright of durham london 0 it is singular that the speculations of this ingenious and original writer have been saved from oblivion in his own country by kant who was indebted for his knowledge of them to a german periodical prof de morgan has described wrights work at some length in the philosophical magazine for april but de morgans attention was drawn to it by aragos notice in the annuaire for and arago who had not seen the book only knew it through kants reference there is an account of wright in the gentlemans magazine p vol this suggestion of kants anticipated lamberts similar suggestion by six years this conception is alluded to in the critique of practical reason p humboldt erroneously identifies kants view of the nebulæ with that of lambert and halley cosmos sabines transl vol iii p compare bishop butlers second sermon on the love of god where he speaks of viewing the scheme of the universe in the mind that projected it quoted by kant from a german translation this suggestion also has been lately developed in a popular manner as a novelty in he repeated the substance of it in the treatise der einsig mogliche beweisgrund zu einer demonstration des daseyns gottes he there mentions that the former work was comparatively little known as it had been published anonymously in he caused an extract from it containing what he thought worth preserving to be appended to sommers translation of herschel on the structure of the heavens this conjecture also has been confirmed philos trans vol xvi a short time previously one dr lister propounded the singular theory that the trade winds were caused by the breath of the marine plant sargasso—ibid vol xiv kant himself says that as far as he knew no previous writer had stated this principle and he was well read in such subjects at that time it had however been stated by geo hadley
