in which he is said to have often thrown out profound and suggestive remarks with extraordinary richness until his sixtythird year not having a house of his own he dined at a public restaurant which however he occasionally found it necessary to change in consequence of persons coming for the purpose of discussing philosophical questions with him he considered that mealtime ought to be a time of perfect mental relaxation and was not disposed to turn the dinner table into a lecture pulpit his afternoons were however often spent at the houses of his friends where he enjoyed meeting foreign merchants sea captains and travelled scholars from whom he might learn much about foreign nations and countries his instructive and entertaining conversation flavoured with mild satiric humour made him a welcome guest and even with the children he was a favourite after he became famous he declined invitations if he thought he was to be made a lion of xlvi when he had a house of his own he had every day a few friends to dine with him he liked to have a mixed company—merchants professional men and especially a few younger men after dinner followed regularly his daily walk for an hour or more along what was from him named the philosophers walk until he was driven from it by the number of beggars whom his habit of almsgiving had attracted there even the severest weather did not interfere with this daily walk in which in his earlier years he usually had companions after sixty years of age he walked alone for the reason already mentioned he had on one occasion a narrow escape from assassination a lunatic who had made up his mind to kill some one waylaid kant for the purpose and followed him for three miles but on reflection thinking it a pity to kill an old professor who must have so many sins on his head the unfortunate madman killed a child instead the evening was devoted to lighter reading and meditation he would read over and over again such books as don quixote hudibras swifts tale of a tub juvenal and horace in his later years he was especially fond of reading books on physical science and books of travel purely speculative works he cared little for but liked to read locke hutcheson pope hume montaigne rousseau how unwilling kant was to depart from his regular routine appears from a characteristic anecdote one day as he was returning from his walk a nobleman xlvii who was driving came up with him and politely invited him to take a drive with him as the evening was fine kant yielded to the first impulse of politeness and consented the count after driving over some of his property near the city proposed to visit a friend some miles from the town and kant of course could not refuse at last kant was set down at his own door near ten oclock full of vexation at this violation of his regular habits he thereupon made it a fixed rule never to get into a carriage that he had not hired himself so that he could manage it as he pleased when once he had made such a resolution he was satisfied that he could not be taken by surprise and nothing would make him depart from it so his life passed says one of his biographers like the most regular of regular verbs punctual however as he was his punctuality did not come up to the standard of his friend green one evening kant had promised that he would accompany green in a drive the next morning at eight at a quarter before eight green was walking up and down his room watch in hand at fifty minutes past seven he put on his coat at fiftyfive he took his stick and at the first stroke of eight entered his carriage and drove off and although he met kant who was a couple of minutes late he would not stop for him because this was against the agreement and against his rule this gentleman for whom kant had a great esteem served as the model for the description of the english character in the anthropologie kants savings were invested with this mr green and allowed to accumulate at per cent interest kant is said to have been on two occasions on the xlviii point of marrying or at least of making a proposal but he took so long to calculate his incomings and outgoings with exactness in order to see whether he could afford it that the lady in the first case was married and in the second had left königsberg before he had made up his mind when he was seventy years of age an officious friend actually printed a dialogue on marriage with a view to persuade the philosopher to marry kant reimbursed him for the expense of printing but at that age not unnaturally thought the advice rather too late how sensible he was to the charms of female society appears from the essay on the sublime and beautiful p ff where he discusses the difference between the sublime and beautiful in the natural relations of the sexes kants personal character is described by those who knew him best as truly childlike he was kindhearted and actively benevolent of rare candour in estimating the abilities of other men with high respect for every thing that was noble or deserving always disposed to recognise the good rather than the bad in mens characters he was always ready with counsel and assistance for the young his modesty towards scholars of great fame almost degenerated into shyness as may be supposed from the regularity of his habits he never allowed himself to run into debt when
