a causality of reason which we designate a will namely a faculty of so acting that the principle of the actions shall conform to the essential character of a rational motive i e the condition that the maxim have universal validity as a law but were it to borrow an object of will that is a motive from the world of understanding then it would overstep its bounds and pretend to be acquainted with something of which it knows nothing the conception of a world of the understanding is then only a point of view which reason finds itself compelled to take outside the appearances in order to conceive itself as practical which would not be possible if the influences of the sensibility had a determining power on man but which is necessary unless he is to be denied the consciousness of himself as an intelligence and consequently as a rational cause energizing by reason that is operating freely this thought certainly involves the idea of an order and a system of laws different from that of the mechanism of nature which belongs to the sensible world and it makes the conception of an intelligible world necessary that is to say the whole system of rational beings as things in themselves but it does not in the least authorize us to think of it further than as to its formal condition only that is the universality of the maxims of the will as laws and consequently the autonomy of the latter which alone is consistent with its freedom whereas on the contrary all laws that refer to a definite object give heteronomy which only belongs to laws of nature and can only apply to the sensible world but reason would overstep all its bounds if it undertook to explain how pure reason can be practical which would be exactly the same problem as to explain how freedom is possible for we can explain nothing but that which we can reduce to laws the object of which can be given in some possible experience but freedom is a mere idea ideal conception the objective reality of which can in no wise be shown according to laws of nature and consequently not in any possible experience and for this reason it can never be comprehended or understood because we can not support it by any sort of example or analogy it holds good only as a necessary hypothesis of reason in a being that believes itself conscious of a will that is of a faculty distinct from mere desire namely a faculty of determining itself to action as an intelligence in other words by laws of reason independently on natural instincts now where determination according to laws of nature ceases there all explanation ceases also and nothing remains but defence i e the removal of the objections of those who pretend to have seen deeper into the nature of things and thereupon boldly declare freedom impossible we can only point out to them that the 0 supposed contradiction that they have discovered in it arises only from this that in order to be able to apply the law of nature to human actions they must necessarily consider man as an appearance then when we demand of them that they should also think of him qua intelligence as a thing in itself they still persist in considering him in this respect also as an appearance in this view it would no doubt be a contradiction to suppose the causality of the same subject that is his will to be withdrawn from all the natural laws of the sensible world but this contradiction disappears if they would only bethink themselves and admit as is reasonable that behind the appearances there must also lie at their root although hidden the things in themselves and that we can not expect the laws of these to be the same as those that govern their appearances the subjective impossibility of explaining the freedom of the will is identical with the impossibility of discovering and explaining an interest which man can take in the moral law nevertheless he does actually take an interest in it the basis of which in us we call the moral feeling which some have falsely assigned as the standard of our moral judgment whereas it must rather be viewed as the subjective effect that the law exercises on the will the objective principle of which is furnished by reason alone in order indeed that a rational being who is also affected through the senses should will what reason alone directs such beings that they ought to will it is no doubt requisite that reason should have a power to infuse a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction in the fulfilment of duty that is to say that it should have a causality by which it determines the sensibility according to its own principles but it is quite impossible to discern i e to make it intelligible à priori how a mere thought which itself contains nothing sensible can itself produce a sensation of pleasure or pain for this is a particular kind of causality of which as of every other causality we can determine nothing whatever à priori we must only consult experience about it but as this can not supply us with any relation of cause and effect except between two objects of experience whereas in this case although indeed the effect produced lies within experience yet the cause is supposed to be pure reason acting through mere ideas which offer no object to experience it follows that for us men it is quite impossible to explain how and why the universality of the maxim as a law that is morality interests this only is certain that it is not because it interests us that it has validity for us for that would be heteronomy and dependence of practical reason on sensibility namely on a feeling as its principle in which case it could
