in this we have the first perhaps the only instance in which we are able from à priori considerations to determine the relation of a cognition in this case of pure practical reason to the feeling of pleasure or displeasure all the inclinations together which can be reduced to a tolerable system in which case their satisfaction is called happiness constitute selfregard solipsismus this is either the selflove that consists in an excessive fondness for oneself philautia or satisfaction with oneself arrogantia the former is called particularly selfishness the latter selfconceit pure practical reason only checks selfishness looking on it as natural and active in us even prior to the moral law so far as to limit it to the condition of agreement with this law and then it is called rational selflove but selfconceit reason strikes down altogether since all claims to selfesteem which precede agreement with the moral law are vain and unjustifiable for the certainty of a state of mind that coincides with this law is the first condition of personal worth as we shall presently show more clearly and prior to this conformity any pretension to worth is false and unlawful now the propensity to selfesteem is one of the inclinations which the moral law checks inasmuch as that esteem rests only on morality therefore the moral law breaks down selfconceit but as this law is something positive in itself namely the form of an intellectual causality that is of freedom it must be an object of respect for by opposing the subjective antagonism of the inclinations it weakens selfconceit and since it even breaks down that is humiliates this conceit it is an object of the highest respect and consequently is the foundation of a positive feeling which is not of empirical origin but is known à priori therefore respect for the moral law is a feeling which is produced by an intellectual cause and this feeling is the only one that we know quite à priori and the necessity of which we can perceive in the preceding chapter we have seen that everything that presents itself as an object of the will prior to the moral law is by that law itself which is the supreme condition of practical reason excluded from the determining principles of the will which we have called the unconditionally good and that the mere practical form which consists in the adaptation of the maxims to universal legislation first determines what is good in itself and absolutely and is the basis of the maxims of a pure will which alone is good in every respect however we find that our nature as sensible beings is such that the matter of desire objects of inclination whether of hope or fear first presents itself to us and our pathologically affected self although it is in its maxims quite unfit for universal legislation yet just as if it constituted our entire self strives to put its pretensions forward first and to have them acknowledged as the first and original this propensity to make ourselves in the subjective determining principles of our choice serve as the objective determining principle of the will generally may be called selflove and if this pretends to be legislative as an unconditional practical principle it may be called selfconceit now the moral law which alone is truly objective namely in every respect entirely excludes the influence of selflove on the supreme practical principle and indefinitely checks the selfconceit that prescribes the subjective conditions of the former as laws now whatever checks our selfconceit in our own judgment humiliates therefore the moral law inevitably humbles every man when he compares with it the physical propensities of his nature that the idea of which as a determining principle of our will humbles us in our selfconsciousness awakes respect for itself so far as it is itself positive and a determining principle therefore the moral law is even subjectively a cause of respect now since everything that enters into selflove belongs to inclination and all inclination rests on feelings and consequently whatever checks all the feelings together in selflove has necessarily by this very circumstance an influence on feeling hence we comprehend how it is possible to perceive à priori that the moral law can produce an effect on feeling in that it excludes the inclinations and the propensity to make them the supreme practical condition i e selflove from all participation in the supreme legislation this effect is on one side merely negative but on the other side relatively to the restricting principle of pure practical reason it is positive no special kind of feeling need be assumed for this under the name of a practical or moral feeling as antecedent to the moral law and serving as its foundation the negative effect on feeling unpleasantness is pathological like every influence on feeling and like every feeling generally but as an effect of the consciousness of the moral law and consequently in relation to a supersensible cause namely the subject of pure practical reason which is the supreme lawgiver this feeling of a rational being affected by inclinations is called humiliation intellectual selfdepreciation but with reference to the positive source of this humiliation the law it is respect for it there is indeed no feeling for this law 00 but inasmuch as it removes the resistance out of the way this removal of an obstacle is in the judgment of reason esteemed equivalent to a positive help to its causality therefore this feeling may also be called a feeling of respect for the moral law and for both reasons together a moral feeling while the moral law therefore is a formal determining principle of action by practical pure reason and is moreover a material though only objective determining principle of the objects of action as called good and evil it is also a subjective determining principle that is a motive to this action inasmuch as it has influence on the morality
