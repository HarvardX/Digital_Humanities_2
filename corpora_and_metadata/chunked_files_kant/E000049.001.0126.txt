not to mention the vices of those who do not conceal them because we are satisfied to call a man good who is a bad man of the average class this will give one enough of the vices of culture and civilization the most mortifying of all to make him turn away his eye from the conduct of men lest he should fall into another vice namely misanthropy if he is not yet satisfied however he need only take into consideration a condition strangely compounded of both namely the external condition of nations—for the relation of civilized nations to one another is that of a rude state of nature a state of perpetual preparation for war and they are also firmly resolved never to abandon it—and he will become aware of principles adopted by the great societies called states which directly contradict the public profession and yet are never to be laid aside principles which no philsopher has yet been able to bring into agreement with morals nor sad to say can they propose any better which would be reconcilable with human nature so that the philosophical millennium which hopes for a state of perpetual peace founded on a union of nations as a republic of the world is generally ridiculed as visionary just as much as the theological which looks for the complete moral improvement of the whole human race now the source of this badness can not as is usually done be placed in the sensibility of man and the natural inclinations springing therefrom for not only have these no direct reference to badness on the contrary they afford the occasion for the moral character to show its power occasion for virtue but further we are not responsible for their existence we can not be for being implanted in us they have not us for their authors whereas we are accountable for the propensity to evil for as this concerns the morality of the subject and is consequently found in him as a freely acting being it must be imputed to him as his own fault notwithstanding its being so deeply rooted in the elective will that it must be said to be found in man by nature the source of this evil can not be placed in a corruption of reason which gives the moral law as if reason could abolish the authority of the law in itself and disown its obligation for this is absolutely impossible to conceive ones self as a freely acting being and yet released from the law which is appropriate to such a being the moral law would be the same as to conceive a cause operating without any law for determination by natural laws is excluded by freedom and this would be a contradiction for the purpose then of assigning a source of the moral evil in man sensibility contains too little for in taking away the motives which arise from freedom it makes him a mere animal being on the other hand a reason releasing from the moral law a malignant reason as it were a simply bad rational will wille involves too much for by this antagonism to the law would itself be made a spring of action for the elective will can not be determined without some spring so that the subject would be made a devilish being neither of these views however is applicable to man now although the existence of this propensity to evil in human nature can be shown by experience from the actual antagonism in time between human will and the law yet this proof does not teach us its proper nature and the source of this antagonism this propensity concerns a relation of the free elective will an elective will therefore the conception of which is not empirical to the moral law as a spring the conception of which is likewise purely intellectual its nature then must be cognized à priori from the concept of the bad so far as the laws of freedom obligation and accountability bear upon it the following is the development of the concept— man even the worst does not in any maxim as it were rebelliously abandon the moral law and renounce obedience to it 0 on the contrary this forces itself upon him irresistibly by virtue of his moral nature and if no other spring opposed it he would also adopt it into his ultimate maxim as the adequate determining principle of his elective will that is he would be morally good but by reason of his physical nature which is likewise blameless he also depends on sensible springs of action and adopts them also into his maxim by the subjective principle of selflove if however he adopted them into his maxim as adequate of themselves alone to determine his will without regarding the moral law which he has within then he would be morally bad now as he naturally adopts both into his maxim and as he would find each if it were alone sufficient to determine his will it follows that if the distinction of the maxims depended merely on the distinction of the springs the matter of the maxims namely according as they were furnished by the law or by an impulse of sense he would be morally good and bad at once which as we saw in the introduction is a contradiction hence the distinction whether the man is good or bad must lie not in the distinction of the springs that he adopts into his maxim but in the subordination i e which of the two he makes the condition of the other that is not in the matter of the maxim but in its form consequently a man even the best is bad only by this that he reverses the moral order of the springs in adopting them into his maxims he adopts indeed the moral law along with that of selflove but perceiving that they can not subsist together on
