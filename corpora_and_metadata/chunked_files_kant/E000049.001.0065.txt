be the foundation but only after it and by means of it in fact even if we did not know that the principle of morality is a pure à priori law determining the will yet that we may not assume principles quite gratuitously we must at least at first leave it undecided whether the will has merely empirical principles of determination or whether it has not also pure à priori principles for it is contrary to all rules of philosophical method to assume as decided that which is the very point in question supposing that we wished to begin with the concept of good in order to deduce from it the laws of the will then this concept of an object as a good would at the same time assign to us this object as the sole determining principle of the will now since this concept had not any practical à priori law for its standard the criterion of good or evil could not be placed in anything but the agreement of the object with our feeling of pleasure or pain and the use of reason could only consist in determining in the first place this pleasure or pain in connexion with all the sensations of my existence and in the second place the means of securing to myself the object of the pleasure now as experience alone can decide what conforms to the feeling of pleasure and by hypothesis the practical law is to be based on this as a condition it follows that the possibility of à priori practical laws would be at once excluded because it was imagined to be necessary first of all to find an object the concept of which as a good should constitute the universal though empirical principle of determination of the will but what it was necessary to inquire first of all was whether there is not an à priori determining principle of the will and this could never be found anywhere but in a pure practical law in so far as this law prescribes to maxims merely their form without regard to an object since however we laid the foundation of all practical law in an object determined by our conceptions of good and evil whereas without a previous law that object could only be conceived by empirical concepts we have deprived ourselves beforehand of the possibility of even conceiving a pure practical law on the other hand if we had first investigated the latter analytically we should have found that it is not the concept of good as an object that determines the moral law and makes it possible but that on the contrary it is the moral law that first determines the concept of good and makes it possible so far as it deserves the name of good absolutely this remark which only concerns the method of ultimate ethical inquiries is of importance it explains at once the occasion of all the mistakes of philosophers with respect to the supreme principle of morals for they sought for an object of the will which they could make the matter and principle of a law which consequently could not determine the will directly but by means of that object referred to the feeling of pleasure or pain whereas they ought first to have searched for a law that would determine the will à priori and directly and afterwards determine the object in accordance with the will now whether they placed this object of pleasure which was to supply the supreme conception of goodness in happiness in perfection in moral feeling or in the will of god their principle in every case implied heteronomy and they must inevitably come upon empirical conditions of a moral law since their object which was to be the immediate principle of the will could not be called good or bad except in its immediate relation to feeling which is always empirical it is only a formal law—that is one which prescribes to reason nothing more than the form of its universal legislation as the supreme condition of its maxims—that can be à priori a determining principle of practical reason the ancients avowed this error without concealment by directing all their moral inquiries to the determination of the notion of the summum bonum which they intended afterwards to make the determining principle of the will in the moral law whereas it is only far later when the moral law has been first established for itself and shown to be the direct determining principle of the will that this object can be presented to the will whose form is now determined à priori and this we shall undertake in the dialectic of the pure practical reason the moderns with whom the question of the summum bonum has gone out of fashion or at least seems to have become a secondary matter hide the same error under vague expressions as in many other cases it shows itself nevertheless in their systems as it always produces heteronomy of practical reason and from this can never be derived a moral law giving universal commands now since the notions of good and evil as consequences of the à priori determination of the will imply also a pure practical principle and therefore a causality of pure reason hence they do not originally refer to objects so as to be for instance special modes of the synthetic unity of the manifold of given intuitions in one consciousness like the pure concepts of the understanding or categories of reason in its theoretic employment on the contrary they presuppose that objects are given but they are all modes modi of a single category namely that of causality the determining principle of which consists in the rational conception of a law which as a law of freedom reason gives to itself thereby à priori proving itself practical however as the actions on the one side come under a law which is not a physical law but a
