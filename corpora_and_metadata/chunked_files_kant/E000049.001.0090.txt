the relation of reason only to the will and consequently made it the supreme practical condition of the summum bonum but it was not therefore the whole condition of its possibility the epicureans had indeed assumed as the supreme principle of morality a wholly false one namely that of happiness and had substituted for a law a maxim of arbitrary choice according to every mans inclination they proceeded however consistently enough in this that they degraded their summum bonum likewise just in proportion to the meanness of their fundamental principle and looked for no greater happiness than can be attained by human prudence including temperance and moderation of the inclinations and this as we know would be scanty enough and would be very different according to circumstances not to mention the exceptions that their maxims must perpetually admit and which make them incapable of being laws the stoics on the contrary had chosen their supreme practical principle quite rightly making virtue the condition of the summum bonum but when they represented the degree of virtue required by its pure law as fully attainable in this life they not only strained the moral powers of the man whom they called the wise beyond all the limits of his nature and assumed a thing that contradicts all our knowledge of men but also and principally they would not allow the second element of the summum bonum namely happiness to be properly a special object of human desire but made their wise man like a divinity in his consciousness of the excellence of his person wholly independent on nature as regards his own contentment they exposed him indeed to the evils of life but made him not subject to them at the same time representing him also as free from moral evil they thus in fact left out the second element of the summum bonum namely personal happiness placing it solely in action and satisfaction with ones own personal worth thus including it in the consciousness of being morally minded in which they might have been sufficiently refuted by the voice of their own nature the doctrine of christianity even if we do not yet consider it as a religious doctrine gives touching this point a conception of the summum bonum the kingdom of god which alone satisfies the strictest demand of practical reason the moral law is holy unyielding and demands holiness of morals although all the moral perfection to which man can attain is still only virtue that is a rightful disposition arising from respect for the law implying consciousness of a constant propensity to transgression or at least a want of purity that is a mixture of many spurious not moral motives of obedience to the law consequently a selfesteem combined with humility in respect then of the holiness which the christian law requires this leaves the creature nothing but a progress in infinitum but for that very reason it justifies him in hoping for an endless duration of his existence the worth of a character perfectly accordant with the moral law is infinite since 0 the only restriction on all possible happiness in the judgment of a wise and allpowerful distributor of it is the absence of conformity of rational beings to their duty but the moral law of itself does not promise any happiness for according to our conceptions of an order of nature in general this is not necessarily connected with obedience to the law now christian morality supplies this defect of the second indispensable element of the summum bonum by representing the world in which rational beings devote themselves with all their soul to the moral law as a kingdom of god in which nature and morality are brought into a harmony foreign to each of itself by a holy author who makes the derived summum bonum possible holiness of life is prescribed to them as a rule even in this life while the welfare proportioned to it namely bliss is represented as attainable only in an eternity because the former must always be the pattern of their conduct in every state and progress towards it is already possible and necessary in this life while the latter under the name of happiness can not be attained at all in this world so far as our own power is concerned and therefore is made simply an object of hope nevertheless the christian principle of morality itself is not theological so as to be heteronomy but is autonomy of pure practical reason since it does not make the knowledge of god and his will the foundation of these laws but only of the attainment of the summum bonum on condition of following these laws and it does not even place the proper spring of this obedience in the desired results but solely in the conception of duty as that of which the faithful observance alone constitutes the worthiness to obtain those happy consequences in this manner the moral laws lead through the conception of the summum bonum as the object and final end of pure practical reason to religion that is to the recognition of all duties as divine commands not as sanctions that is to say arbitrary ordinances of a foreign will and contingent in themselves but as essential laws of every free will in itself which nevertheless must be regarded as commands of the supreme being because it is only from a morally perfect holy and good and at the same time allpowerful will and consequently only through harmony with this will that we can hope to attain the summum bonum which the moral law makes it our duty to take as the object of our endeavours here again then all remains disinterested and founded merely on duty neither fear nor hope being made the fundamental springs which if taken as principles would destroy the whole moral worth of actions the moral law commands me to make the highest possible good in a world the ultimate
