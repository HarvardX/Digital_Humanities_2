he said it not in debate of the members of the house of commons adding that he knew the price of each the proper proof of this condemnation pronounced by the morally judging reason is not contained in this section but in the preceding this contains only the confirmation of it by experience which however could never discover the root of the evil in the supreme maxim of free elective will in relation to the law this being an intelligible act which is antecedent to all experience from this that is from the unity of the supreme maxim the law to which it refers being one it may also be seen why in forming a purely intellectual judgment of men the principle of exclusion of a mean between good and bad must be assumed whereas in forming the empirical judgment from sensible acts actual conduct the principle may be assumed that there is a mean between these extremes on one side a negative mean of indifference previous to all cultivation and on the other side a positive mean of mixture so as to be partly good and partly bad but the latter is only an estimation of the morality of man in appearance and is in the final judgment subject to the former the three socalled higher faculties would explain this inheritance each in its own way namely as a hereditary malady or hereditary guilt or hereditary sin the medical faculty would regard hereditary evil as something like the tapeworm respecting which some naturalists are actually of opinion that as it is not found in any element outside us nor of the same kind in any other animal it must have been present in our first parents the legal faculty would regard it as the legitimate consequence of entering on an inheritance left to us by them but burdened with a heavy crime for to be born is nothing else but to obtain the use of the goods of earth so far as they are indispensable to our subsistence we must therefore pay the debt expiate and shall in the end be dispossessed by death right legally the theological faculty would view this evil as a personal participation of our first parents in the revolt of a reprobate rebel either that we though now unconscious of it did then cooperate in it ourselves or that now being born under his dominion as prince of this world we prefer its goods to the command of the heavenly ruler and have not loyalty enough to tear ourselves from them for which we must hereafter share his lot with him as long as the moral law is not allowed the predominance in ones maxims above all other determining principles of the elective will as the spring sufficient of itself all profession of respect for it is feigned and the propensity to this is inward falsehood that is a propensity to deceive ones self to the prejudice of the moral law in interpreting it iii on which account the bible christian part calls the author of evil residing in ourselves the liar from the beginning and thus characterizes man in respect of what appears to be the main principle of evil in him rom v vulgate luthers version is correct jerome also gives the correct interpretation although he retains the in quo of the old version probably this was meant by the original translator as a literal rendering of the greek ἐϕ editor illegible character in that it is a very common supposition of moral philosophy that it is very easy to explain the existence of moral evil in man namely that it arises from the strength of the sensible springs of action on the one hand and the feebleness of the rational spring respect for the law on the other that is from weakness but in that case it should be still easier to explain the moral good in man in his moral capacity for one can not be conceived to be comprehensible without the other but the faculty of reason to become master over all opposing springs of action by the mere idea of the law is absolutely inexplicable it is then equally incomprehensible how the sensible springs can become masters of a reason which commands with such authority for if all the world acted according to the precept of the law it would be said that everything was going on in the natural order and it would not occur to anyone to inquire the cause—religion c pp note these remarks must not be regarded as intended to be an interpretation of scripture—a thing that lies outside the province of mere reason we explain the manner in which a moral use may be made of a historical statement without deciding whether this was the meaning of the writer or whether we only introduce it provided only that it is true in itself without needing any historical proof and that it is at the same time the only way in which we can derive something for our own improvement from a passage of scripture which would otherwise be only an unprofitable addition to our historical knowledge we must not without necessity contend about the historical authority of a matter which whether it be understood in this way or in that does not help us to become better men 0 when what does help can and must be known without historical proof historical knowledge which has no such inner reference that can hold good for every man belongs to the adiaphora with respect to which everyone may judge as he finds most edifying for himself in the first edition this appears simply as no v the tree that is good as to its capacities is not yet so in fact for if it were so it certainly could not bring forth bad fruit it is only when the man has adopted into his maxim the spring which is placed in him for the moral
