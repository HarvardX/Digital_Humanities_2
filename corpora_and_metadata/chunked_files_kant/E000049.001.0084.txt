for to need happiness to deserve it and yet at the same time not to participate in it can not be consistent with the perfect volition of a rational being possessed at the same time of all power if for the sake of experiment we conceive such a being now inasmuch as virtue and happiness together constitute the possession of the summum bonum in a person and the distribution of happiness in exact proportion to morality which is the worth of the person and his worthiness to be happy constitutes the summum bonum of a possible world hence this summum bonum expresses the whole the perfect good in which however virtue as the condition is always the supreme good since it has no condition above it whereas happiness while it is pleasant to the possessor of it is not of itself absolutely and in all respects 0 good but always presupposes morally right behaviour as its condition when two elements are necessarily united in one concept they must be connected as reason and consequence and this either so that their unity is considered as analytical logical connexion or as synthetical real connexion—the former following the law of identity the latter that of causality the connexion of virtue and happiness may therefore be understood in two ways either the endeavour to be virtuous and the rational pursuit of happiness are not two distinct actions but absolutely identical in which case no maxim need be made the principle of the former other than what serves for the latter or the connexion consists in this that virtue produces happiness as something distinct from the consciousness of virtue as a cause produces an effect the ancient greek schools were properly speaking only two and in determining the conception of the summum bonum these followed in fact one and the same method inasmuch as they did not allow virtue and happiness to be regarded as two distinct elements of the summum bonum and consequently sought the unity of the principle by the rule of identity but they differed as to which of the two was to be taken as the fundamental notion the epicurean said to be conscious that ones maxims lead to happiness is virtue the stoic said to be conscious of ones virtue is happiness with the former prudence was equivalent to morality with the latter who chose a higher designation for virtue morality alone was true wisdom while we must admire the men who in such early times tried all imaginable ways of extending the domain of philosophy we must at the same time lament that their acuteness was unfortunately misapplied in trying to trace out identity between two extremely heterogeneous notions those of happiness and virtue but it agreed with the dialectical spirit of their times and subtle minds are even now sometimes misled in the same way to get rid of irreconcilable differences in principle by seeking to change them into a mere contest about 0 words and thus apparently working out the identity of the notion under different names and this usually occurs in cases where the combination of heterogeneous principles lies so deep or so high or would require so complete a transformation of the doctrines assumed in the rest of the philosophical system that men are afraid to penetrate deeply into the real difference and prefer treating it as a difference in matters of form while both schools sought to trace out the identity of the practical principles of virtue and happiness they were not agreed as to the way in which they tried to force this identity but were separated infinitely from one another the one placing its principle on the side of sense the other on that of reason the one in the consciousness of sensible wants the other in the independence of practical reason on all sensible grounds of determination according to the epicurean the notion of virtue was already involved in the maxim to promote ones own happiness according to the stoics on the other hand the feeling of happiness was already contained in the consciousness of virtue now whatever is contained in another notion is identical with part of the containing notion but not with the whole and moreover two wholes may be specifically distinct although they consist of the same parts namely if the parts are united into a whole in totally different ways the stoic maintained that virtue was the whole summum bonum and happiness only the consciousness of possessing it as making part of the state of the subject the epicurean maintained that happiness was the whole summum bonum and virtue only the form of the maxim for its pursuit viz the rational use of the means for attaining it now it is clear from the analytic that the maxims of virtue and those of private happiness are quite heterogeneous as to their supreme practical principle and although they belong to one summum bonum which together they make possible yet they are so far from coinciding that they restrict and check one another very much in the same subject thus the question how is the summum bonum practically possible still remains an unsolved problem notwithstanding all the attempts at coalition 0 that have hitherto been made the analytic has however shown what it is that makes the problem difficult to solve namely that happiness and morality are two specifically distinct elements of the summum bonum and therefore their combination can not be analytically cognised as if the man that seeks his own happiness should find by mere analysis of his conception that in so acting he is virtuous or as if the man that follows virtue should in the consciousness of such conduct find that he is already happy ipso facto 0 but must be a synthesis of concepts now since this combination is recognised as à priori and therefore as practically necessary and consequently not as derived from experience so that the possibility of the summum bonum does
