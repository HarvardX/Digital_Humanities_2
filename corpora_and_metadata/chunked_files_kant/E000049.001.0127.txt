equal terms but that one must be subordinate to the other as its supreme condition he makes the spring of selflove and its inclinations the condition of obedience to the moral law whereas on the contrary the latter ought to be adopted into the general maxims of the elective will as the sole spring being the supreme condition of the satisfaction of the former the springs being thus reversed by his maxim contrary to the moral order his actions may nevertheless conform to the law just as though they had sprung from genuine principles provided reason employs the unity of maxims in general which is proper to the moral law merely for the purpose of introducing into the springs of inclination a unity that does not belong to them under the name of happiness ex gr that truthfulness if adopted as a principle relieves us of the anxiety to maintain consistency in our lies and to escape being entangled in their serpent coils in which case the empirical character is good but the intelligible character bad now if there is in human nature a propensity to this then there is in man a natural propensity to evil and since this propensity itself must ultimately be sought in a free elective will and therefore can be imputed it is morally bad this badness is radical because it corrupts the source of all maxims and at the same time being a natural propensity it can not be destroyed by human powers since this could only be done by good maxims and when by hypothesis the ultimate subjective source of all maxims is corrupt these can not exist nevertheless it must be possible to overcome it since it is found in man as a freely acting being the depravity of human nature then is not so much to be called badness if this word is taken in its strict sense namely as a disposition subjective principle of maxims to adopt the bad as bad into ones maxims as a spring for that is devilish but rather perversity of heart which on account of the result is also called a bad heart this may coexist with a will wille good in general and arises from the frailty of human nature which is not strong enough to follow its adopted principles combined with its impurity in not distinguishing the springs even of wellintentioned actions from one another by moral rule so that ultimately it looks at best only to the conformity of its actions with the law not to their derivation from it that is to the law itself as the only spring now although this does not always give rise to wrong actions and a propensity thereto that is to vice yet the habit of regarding the absence of vice as a conformity of the mind to the law of duty as virtue must itself be designated a radical perversity of the human heart since in this case the spring in the maxims is not regarded at all but only the obedience to the letter of the law this is called innate guilt reatus because it can be perceived as soon as ever the use of freedom manifests itself in man and nevertheless must have arisen from freedom and therefore may be imputed it may in its two first degrees of frailty and impurity be viewed as unintentional guilt culpa but in the third as intentional dolus and it is characterized by a certain malignancy of the human heart dolus malus deceiving itself as to its own good or bad dispositions and provided only its actions have not the bad result which by their maxims they might well have then not disquieting itself about its dispositions but on the contrary holding itself to be justified before the law hence comes the peace of conscience of so many in their own opinion conscientious men when amidst actions in which the law was not taken into counsel or at least was not the most important consideration they have merely had the good fortune to escape bad consequences perhaps they even imagine they have merit not feeling themselves guilty of any of the transgressions in which they see others involved without inquiring whether fortune is not to be thanked for this and whether the disposition which if they would they could discover within would not have led them to the practice of the like vices had they not been kept away from them by want of power by temperament education circumstances of time and place which lead into temptation all things that can not be imputed to us this dishonesty in imposing on ourselves which hinders the establishment of genuine moral principle in us extends itself then outwardly also to falsehood and deception of others which if it is not to be called badness at least deserves to be called worthlessness and has its root in the radical badness of human nature which inasmuch as it perverts the moral judgment in respect of the estimation to be formed of a man and renders imputation quite uncertain both internally and externally constitutes the corrupt spot in our nature which as long as we do not extirpate it hinders the source of good from developing itself as it otherwise would a member of the english parliament uttered in the heat of debate the declaration every man has his price if this is true which every one may decide for himself—if there is no virtue for which a degree of temptation can not be found which is capable of overthrowing it—if the question whether the good or the bad spirit shall gain us to its side only depends on which bids highest and offers most prompt payment—then what the apostle says might well be true of men universally there is no difference they are altogether sinners there is none that doeth good according to the spirit of the law no not one iv on the origin of the evil in
