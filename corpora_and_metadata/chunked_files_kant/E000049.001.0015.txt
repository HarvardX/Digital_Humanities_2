must admit that if a law is to have moral force i e to be the basis of an obligation it must carry with it absolute necessity that for example the precept thou shalt not lie is not valid for men alone as if other rational beings had no need to observe it and so with all the other moral laws properly so called that therefore the basis of obligation must not be sought in the nature of man or in the circumstances in the world in which he is placed but à priori simply in the conceptions of pure reason and although any other precept which is founded on principles of mere experience may be in certain respects universal yet in as far as it rests even in the least degree on an empirical basis perhaps only as to a motive such a precept while it may be a practical rule can never be called a moral law thus not only are moral laws with their principles essentially distinguished from every other kind of practical knowledge in which there is anything empirical but all moral philosophy rests wholly on its pure part when applied to man it does not borrow the least thing from the knowledge of man himself anthropology but gives laws à priori to him as a rational being no doubt these laws require a judgment sharpened by experience in order on the one hand to distinguish in what cases they are applicable and on the other to procure for them access to the will of the man and effectual influence on conduct since man is acted on by so many inclinations that though capable of the idea of a practical pure reason he is not so easily able to make it effective in concreto in his life a metaphysic of morals is therefore indispensably necessary not merely for speculative reasons in order to investigate the sources of the practical principles which are to be found à priori in our reason but also because morals themselves are liable to all sorts of corruption as long as we are without that clue and supreme canon by which to estimate them correctly for in order that an action should be morally good it is not enough that it conform to the moral law but it must also be done for the sake of the law otherwise that conformity is only very contingent and uncertain since a principle which is not moral although it may now and then produce actions conformable to the law will also often produce actions which contradict it now it is only in a pure philosophy that we can look for the moral law in its purity and genuineness and in a practical matter this is of the utmost consequence we must therefore begin with pure philosophy metaphysic and without it there can not be any moral philosophy at all that which mingles these pure principles with the empirical does not deserve the name of philosophy for what distinguishes philosophy from common rational knowledge is that it treats in separate sciences what the latter only comprehends confusedly much less does it deserve that of moral philosophy since by this confusion it even spoils the purity of morals themselves and counteracts its own end let it not be thought however that what is here demanded is already extant in the propædeutic prefixed by the celebrated wolf to his moral philosophy namely his socalled general practical philosophy and that therefore we have not to strike into an entirely new field just because it was to be a general practical philosophy it has not taken into consideration a will of any particular kind—say one which should be determined solely from à priori principles without any empirical motives and which we might call a pure will but volition in general with all the actions and conditions which belong to it in this general signification by this it is distinguished from a metaphysic of morals just as general logic which treats of the acts and canons of thought in general is distinguished from transcendental philosophy which treats of the particular acts and canons of pure thought ie that whose cognitions are altogether à priori for the metaphysic of morals has to examine the idea and the principles of a possible pure will and not the acts and conditions of human volition generally which for the most part are drawn from psychology it is true that moral laws and duty are spoken of in the general practical philosophy contrary indeed to all fitness but this is no objection for in this respect also the authors of that science remain true to their idea of it they do not distinguish the motives which are prescribed as such by reason alone altogether à priori and which are properly moral from the empirical motives which the understanding raises to general conceptions merely by comparison of experiences but without noticing the difference of their sources and looking on them all as homogeneous they consider only their greater or less amount it is in this way they frame their notion of obligation which though anything but moral is all that can be asked for in a philosophy which passes no judgment at all on the origin of all possible practical concepts whether they are à priori or only à posteriori intending to publish hereafter a metaphysic of morals i issue in the first instance these fundamental principles indeed there is properly no other foundation for it than the critical examination of a pure practical reason just as that of metaphysics is the critical examination of the pure speculative reason already published but in the first place the former is not so absolutely necessary as the latter because in moral concerns human reason can easily be brought to a high degree of correctness and completeness even in the commonest understanding while on the contrary in its theoretic but pure use it is wholly dialectical and in the second
