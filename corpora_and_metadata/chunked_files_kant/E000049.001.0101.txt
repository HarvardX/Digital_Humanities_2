may be produced in us the method then takes the following course at first we are only concerned to make the judging of actions by moral laws a natural employment accompanying all our own free actions as well as the observation of those of others and to make it as it were a habit and to sharpen this judgment asking first whether the action conforms objectively to the moral law and to what law and we distinguish the law that merely furnishes a principle of obligation from that which is really obligatory leges obligandi a legibus obligantibus as for instance the law of what mens wants require from me as contrasted with that which their rights demand the latter of which prescribes 0 essential the former only nonessential duties and thus we teach how to distinguish different kinds of duties which meet in the same action the other point to which attention must be directed is the question whether the action was also subjectively done for the sake of the moral law so that it not only is morally correct as a deed but also by the maxim from which it is done has moral worth as a disposition now there is no doubt that this practice and the resulting culture of our reason in judging merely of the practical must gradually produce a certain interest even in the law of reason and consequently in morally good actions for we ultimately take a liking for a thing the contemplation of which makes us feel that the use of our cognitive faculties is extended and this extension is especially furthered by that in which we find moral correctness since it is only in such an order of things that reason with its faculty of determining Ã  priori on principle what ought to be done can find satisfaction an observer of nature takes liking at last to objects that at first offended his senses when he discovers in them the great adaptation of their organization to design so that his reason finds food in its contemplation so leibnitz spared an insect that he had carefully examined with the microscope and replaced it on its leaf because he had found himself instructed by the view of it and had as it were received a benefit from it but this employment of the faculty of judgment which makes us feel our own cognitive powers is not yet the interest in actions and in their morality itself it merely causes us to take pleasure in engaging in such criticism and it gives to virtue or the disposition that conforms to moral laws a form of beauty which is admired but not on that account sought after laudatur et alget as everything the contemplation of which produces a consciousness of the harmony of our powers of conception and in which we feel the whole of our faculty of knowledge understanding and imagination strengthened produces a satisfaction which may also be communicated to others while nevertheless the existence of the object remains indifferent to us being only regarded as the occasion of our becoming aware of the capacities in us which are elevated above mere animal nature now however the second exercise comes in the living exhibition of morality of character by examples in which attention is directed to purity of will first only as a negative perfection in so far as in an action done from duty no motives of inclination have any influence in determining it by this the pupils attention is fixed upon the consciousness of his freedom and although this renunciation at first excites a feeling of pain nevertheless by its withdrawing the pupil from the constraint of even real wants there is proclaimed to him at the same time a deliverance from the manifold dissatisfaction in which all these wants entangle him and the mind is made capable of receiving the sensation of satisfaction from other sources the heart is freed and lightened of a burden that always secretly presses on it when instances of pure moral resolutions reveal to the man an inner faculty of which otherwise he has no right knowledge the inward freedom to release himself from the boisterous importunity of inclinations to such a degree that none of them not even the dearest shall have any influence on a resolution for which we are now to employ our reason suppose a case where i alone know that the wrong is on my side and although a free confession of it and the offer of satisfaction are so strongly opposed by vanity selfishness and even an otherwise not illegitimate antipathy to the man whose rights are impaired by me i am nevertheless able to discard all these considerations in this there is implied a consciousness of independence on inclinations and circumstances and of the possibility of being sufficient for myself which is salutary to me in general for other purposes also and now the law of duty in consequence of the positive worth which obedience to it makes us feel finds easier access through the respect for ourselves in the consciousness of our freedom when this is well established when a man dreads nothing more than to find himself on selfexamination worthless and contemptible in his own eyes then every good moral disposition can be grafted on it because this is the best nay the only guard that can keep off from the mind the pressure of ignoble and corrupting motives 0 i have only intended to point out the most general maxims of the methodology of moral cultivation and exercise as the manifold variety of duties requires special rules for each kind and this would be a prolix affair i shall be readily excused if in a work like this which is only preliminary i content myself with these outlines conclusion two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe the oftener and the more steadily we reflect on them the starry heavens above
