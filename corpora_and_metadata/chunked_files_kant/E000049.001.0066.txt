law of freedom and consequently belong to the conduct of beings in the world of intelligence yet on the other side as events in the world of sense they belong to phenomena hence the determinations of a practical reason are only possible in reference to the latter and therefore in accordance with the categories of the understanding not indeed with a view to any theoretic employment of it ie so as to bring the manifold of sensible intuition under one consciousness à priori but only to subject the manifold of desires to the unity of consciousness of a practical reason giving it commands in the moral law i e to a pure will à priori these categories of freedom—for so we choose to call them in contrast to those theoretic categories which are categories of physical nature—have an obvious advantage over the latter inasmuch as the latter are only forms of thought which designate objects in an indefinite manner by means of universal concepts for every possible intuition the former on the contrary refer to the determination of a free elective will to which indeed no exactly corresponding intuition can be assigned but which has as its foundation a pure practical à priori law which is not the case with any concepts belonging to the theoretic use of our cognitive faculties hence instead of the form of intuition space and time which does not lie in reason itself but has to be drawn from another source namely the sensibility these being elementary practical concepts have as their foundation the form of a pure will which is given in reason and therefore in the thinking faculty itself from this it happens that as all precepts of pure practical reason have to do only with the determination of the will not with the physical conditions of practical ability of the execution of ones purpose the practical à priori principles in relation to the supreme principle of freedom are at once cognitions and have not to wait for intuitions in order to acquire significance and that for this remarkable reason because they themselves produce the reality of that to which they refer the intention of the will which is not the case with theoretical concepts only we must be careful to observe that these categories only apply to the practical reason and thus they proceed in order from those which are as yet subject to sensible conditions and morally indeterminate to those which are free from sensible conditions and determined merely by the moral law table of the categories of freedom relatively to the notions of good and evil i —quantitysubjective according to maxims practical opinions of the individual objective according to principles precepts a priori both objective and subjective principles of freedom laws ii —qualitypractical rules of action præceptivæ practical rules of omission prohibitivæ practical rules of exceptions exceptivæ iii —relationto personality to the condition of the person reciprocal of one person to the condition of the others iv —modalitythe permitted and the forbidden duty and the contrary to duty perfect and imperfect duty it will at once be observed that in this table freedom is considered as a sort of causality not subject to empirical principles of determination in regard to actions possible by it which are phenomena in the world of sense and that consequently it is referred to the categories which concern its physical possibility whilst yet each category is taken so universally that the determining principle of that causality can be placed outside the world of sense in freedom as a property of a being in the world of intelligence and finally the categories of modality introduce the transition from practical principles generally to those of morality but only problematically these can be established dogmatically only by the moral law i add nothing further here in explanation of the present table since it is intelligible enough of itself a division of this kind based on principles is very useful in any science both for the sake of thoroughness and intelligibility thus for instance we know from the preceding table and its first number what we must begin from in practical inquiries namely from the maxims which everyone founds on his own inclinations the precepts which hold for a species of rational beings so far as they agree in certain inclinations and finally the law which holds for all without regard to their inclinations c in this way we survey the whole plan of what has to be done every question of practical philosophy that has to be answered and also the order that is to be followed of the typic of the pure practical judgment it is the notions of good and evil that first determine an object of the will they themselves however 0 are subject to a practical rule of reason which if it is pure reason determines the will à priori relatively to its object now whether an action which is possible to us in the world of sense comes under the rule or not is a question to be decided by the practical judgment by which what is said in the rule universally in abstracto is applied to an action in concreto but since a practical rule of pure reason in the first place as practical concerns the existence of an object and in the second place as a practical rule of pure reason implies necessity as regards the existence of the action and therefore is a practical law not a physical law depending on empirical principles of determination but a law of freedom by which the will is to be determined independently on anything empirical merely by the conception of a law and its form whereas all instances that can occur of possible actions can only be empirical that is belong to the experience of physical nature hence it seems absurd to expect to find in the world of sense a case which while as such it depends only on the law of
