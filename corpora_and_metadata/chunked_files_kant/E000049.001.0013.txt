and therefore selfwilled law which makes good a duty it is inconceivable that the pure supersensible essence could invest the sensational nature the objects of which have for it no reality with a preponderance over itself a further contradiction appears to be involved in the relation of evil to freedom for he states that freedom is as inseparably connected with the law of practical reason as the physical cause with the law of nature so that freedom without the law of practical reason is a causality without law which would be absurd and yet on the other hand he regards freedom as an ability from which proceeds contradiction to the moral law a still more insuperable difficulty meets him when he attempts to answer the question is reformation possible he replies yes for it is a duty you ought therefore you can how the return from evil lxi to good is possible can not indeed be comprehended but the original fall from good to evil is equally incomprehensible and yet is a fact now freedom which belongs to the supersensible sphere the sphere of noumena can not be determined by anything in the phenomenal world consequently if freedom has apart from time given the man a determination then no event in time can produce a change nay it would be a contradiction to suppose the removal of an act in the noumenal supersensible world by a succeeding act contrary or contradictory attributes can not be attributed to the same subject except under the condition of time if therefore the intelligent being is timeless we can not possibly attribute to it two decisions of which one annuls the other he is not even consistent for he argues that it is not possible to destroy this radical corruption by human power but only to overcome it why does he not conclude here i ought to destroy it therefore i can lastly even if this i can were granted it would be only a theoretical not a practical possibility if the man endowed with the faculties in their true subordination with reason supreme has yet not had strength or purity of will to remain so what practical possibility is there that having this subordination perverted he can restore it there is obviously an external aid necessary here not that anything wholly external could effect the change which can only be produced by something operating on mans own moral nature but there must be a moral leverage an external fulcrum a πονˆ στωˆ such aid such leverage are provided by the christian religion it has introduced a new motive perfectly original and lxii unique the overpowering force of which has been proved in many crucial instances and no more complete theoretical proof of the absolute necessity of some such revelation could be given than is supplied by the attempts of the profoundest philosopher of modern times to dispense with it kants own position with respect to christianity is that of a rationalist he accepts the whole moral and spiritual teaching of the new testament because he finds it in accordance with reason and this being so he judges that it is a matter of no practical consequence whether its introduction was supernatural or not he did not deny that divine aid was required to make reformation possible but he thought that no intellectual belief or knowledge of ours could be a condition of this aid and therefore that all historical questions were adiaphora but this is to take for granted that if god gives such aid at all it must be in a particular way butlers argument from analogy is conclusive against such assumptions and indeed it is certain that the moral and the positive in christianity can not be thus kept apart it is to the facts that the doctrines owe their life and motive power it is these that supply the leverage without which the most perfect moral teaching will fall dead on the ears at least of the masses of mankind besides as butler shows revealed facts may be the foundation of moral duties to those to whom the revelation has come it is remarkable that although kant was fond of reading english authors and was influenced in his moral discussions by english moralists butler who had written half a century before the publication of lxiii the kritik was wholly unknown to him what is more remarkable is that butler has remained equally unknown to german writers up to the present day whilst german historians of moral philosophy are careful to note the merits of even wollaston and ferguson they pass over butlers name in silence the reason of this silence doubtless is to be found in the title of his work but although foreign philosophers could not be expected to look for a treatise on moral philosophy in a book called fifteen sermons how is it that attention was not called to him by the notices in mackintosh who is largely cited e g by i h fichte which showed the high estimation in which the work was held in england it is certainly a curious and suggestive fact that writers professedly and learnedly treating of english moral philosophers should be wholly ignorant of the writer who holds by far the highest rank among them whose work is the classical work the textbook of the universities and with a wider circulation probably than the works of all the other moralists put together the most striking peculiarity of kants moral theory is its connexion with his metaphysical system it is in the moral law that he finds the means of establishing the existence and to some extent the nature of the supersensible reality he has been charged with inconsistency in this what he pulls down in the critique of the speculative reason he restores illogically it is said in that of the practical reason the fact appears to be that readers of the former work are apt to fall into two
