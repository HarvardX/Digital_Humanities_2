place if the critique of a pure practical reason is to be complete it must be possible at the same time to show its identity with the speculative reason in a common principle for it can ultimately be only one and the same reason which has to be distinguished merely in its application i could not however bring it to such completeness here without introducing considerations of a wholly different kind which would be perplexing to the reader on this account i have adopted the title of fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals instead of that of a critical examination of the pure practical reason but in the third place since a metaphysic of morals in spite of the discouraging title is yet capable of being presented in a popular form and one adapted to the common understanding i find it useful to separate from it this preliminary treatise on its fundamental principles in order that i may not hereafter have need to introduce these necessarily subtle discussions into a book of a more simple character the present treatise is however nothing more than the investigation and establishment of the supreme principle of morality and this alone constitutes a study complete in itself and one which ought to be kept apart from every other moral investigation no doubt my conclusions on this weighty question which has hitherto been very unsatisfactorily examined would receive much light from the application of the same principle to the whole system and would be greatly confirmed by the adequacy which it exhibits throughout but i must forego this advantage which indeed would be after all more gratifying than useful since the easy applicability of a principle and its apparent adequacy give no very certain proof of its soundness but rather inspire a certain partiality which prevents us from examining and estimating it strictly in itself and without regard to consequences i have adopted in this work the method which i think most suitable proceeding analytically from common knowledge to the determination of its ultimate principle and again descending synthetically from the examination of this principle and its sources to the common knowledge in which we find it employed the division will therefore be as follows 0— first section—transition from the common rational knowledge of morality to the philosophical second section—transition from popular moral philosophy to the metaphysic of morals third section—final step from the metaphysic of morals to the critique of the pure practical reason first section transition from the common rational knowledge of morality to the philosophical nothing can possibly be conceived in the world or even out of it which can be called good without qualification except a good will intelligence wit judgment and the other talents of the mind however they may be named or courage resolution perseverance as qualities of temperament are undoubtedly good and desirable in many respects but these gifts of nature may also become extremely bad and mischievous if the will which is to make use of them and which therefore constitutes what is called character is not good it is the same with the gifts of fortune power riches honour even health and the general wellbeing and contentment with ones condition which is called happiness inspire pride and often presumption if there is not a good will to correct the influence of these on the mind and with this also to rectify the whole principle of acting and adapt it to its end the sight of a being who is not adorned with a single feature of a pure and good will enjoying unbroken prosperity can never give pleasure to an impartial rational spectator thus a good will appears to constitute the indispensable condition even of being worthy of happiness there are even some qualities which are of service to this good will itself and may facilitate its action yet which have no intrinsic unconditional value but always presuppose a good will and this qualifies the esteem that we justly have for them and does not permit us to regard them as absolutely good moderation in the affections and passions selfcontrol and calm deliberation are not only good in many respects but even seem to constitute part of the intrinsic worth of the person but they are far from deserving to be called good without qualification 0 although they have been so unconditionally praised by the ancients for without the principles of a good will they may become extremely bad and the coolness of a villain not only makes him far more dangerous but also directly makes him more abominable in our eyes than he would have been without it a good will is good not because of what it performs or effects not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end but simply by virtue of the volition that is it is good in itself and considered by itself is to be esteemed much higher than all that can be brought about by it in favour of any inclination nay even of the sum total of all inclinations even if it should happen that owing to special disfavour of fortune or the niggardly provision of a stepmotherly nature this will should wholly lack power to accomplish its purpose if with its greatest efforts it should yet achieve nothing and there should remain only the good will not to be sure a mere wish but the summoning of all means in our power then like a jewel it would still shine by its own light as a thing which has its whole value in itself its usefulness or fruitlessness can neither add to nor take away anything from this value it would be as it were only the setting to enable us to handle it the more conveniently in common commerce or to attract to it the attention of those who are not yet connoisseurs but not to recommend it to true connoisseurs or to determine its value there is however something so strange
