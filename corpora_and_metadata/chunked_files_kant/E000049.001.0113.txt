it is likewise a contradiction to make the perfection of another my end and to regard myself as in duty bound to promote it for it is just in this that the perfection of another man as a person consists namely that he is able of himself to set before him his own end according to his own notions of duty and it is a contradiction to require to make it a duty for me that i should do something which no other but himself can do v —explanation of these two notions a —our own perfection the word perfection is liable to many misconceptions it is sometimes understood as a notion belonging to transcendental philosophy viz the notion of the totality of the manifold which taken together constitutes a thing sometimes again it is understood as belonging to teleology so that it signifies the correspondence of the properties of a thing to an end perfection in the former sense might be called quantitative material in the latter qualitative formal perfection the former can be one only for the whole of what belongs to the one thing is one but of the latter there may be several in one thing and it is of the latter property that we here treat when it is said of the perfection that belongs to man generally properly speaking to humanity that it is in itself a duty to make this our end it must be placed in that which may be the effect of ones deed not in that which is merely an endowment for which we have to thank nature for otherwise it would not be duty consequently it can be nothing else than the cultivation of ones power or natural capacity and also of ones will wille moral disposition to satisfy the requirement of duty in general the supreme element in the former the power is the understanding it being the faculty of concepts and therefore also of those concepts which refer to duty first it is his duty to labour to raise himself out of the rudeness of his nature out of his animal nature more and more to humanity by which alone he is capable of setting before him ends to supply the defects of his ignorance by instruction and to correct his errors he is not merely counselled to do this by reason as technically practical with a view to his purposes of other kinds as art but reason as morally practical absolutely commands him to do it and makes this end his duty in order that he may be worthy of the humanity that dwells in him secondly to carry the cultivation of his will up to the purest virtuous disposition that namely in which the law is also the spring of his dutiful actions and to obey it from duty for this is internal morally practical perfection this is called the moral sense as it were a special sense sensus moralis because it is a feeling of the effect which the legislative will within himself exercises on the faculty of acting accordingly this is indeed often misused fanatically as though like the genius of socrates it preceded reason or even could dispense with judgment of reason but still it is a moral perfection making every special end which is also a duty ones own end b —happiness of others it is inevitable for human nature that a man should wish and seek for happiness that is satisfaction with his condition with certainty of the continuance of this satisfaction but for this very reason it is not an end that is also a duty some writers still make a distinction between moral and physical happiness the former consisting in satisfaction with ones person and moral behaviour that is with what one does the other in satisfaction with that which nature confers consequently with what one enjoys as a foreign gift without at present censuring the misuse of the word which even involves a contradiction it must be observed that the feeling of the former belongs solely to the preceding head namely perfection for he who is to feel himself happy in the mere consciousness of his uprightness already possesses that perfection which in the previous section was defined as that end which is also duty if happiness then is in question which it is to be my duty to promote as my end it must be the happiness of other men whose permitted end i hereby make also mine it still remains left to themselves to decide what they shall reckon as belonging to their happiness only that it is in my power to decline many things which they so reckon but which i do not so regard supposing that they have no right to demand it from me as their own a plausible objection often advanced against the division of duties above adopted consists in setting over against that end a supposed obligation to study my own physical happiness and thus making this which is my natural and merely subjective end my duty and objective end this requires to be cleared up adversity pain and want are great temptations to transgression of ones duty accordingly it would seem that strength health a competence and welfare generally which are opposed to that influence may also be regarded as ends that are also duties that is that it is a duty to promote our own happiness not merely to make that of others our end but in that case the end is not happiness but the morality of the agent and happiness is only the means of removing the hindrances to morality permitted means since no one has a right to demand from me the sacrifice of my not immoral ends it is not directly a duty to seek a competence for ones self but indirectly it may be so namely in order to guard against poverty which is a great temptation to vice but then it is
