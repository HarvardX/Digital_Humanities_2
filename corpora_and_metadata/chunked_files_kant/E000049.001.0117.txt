juridical duty that by it ends are proposed from which jurisprudence altogether abstracts in the case of the moral imperative and the supposition of freedom which it necessarily involves the law the power to fulfil it and the rational will that determines the maxim constitute all the elements that form the notion of juridical duty but in the imperative which commands the duty of virtue there is added besides the notion of selfconstraint that of an end not one that we have but that we ought to have which therefore pure practical reason has in itself whose highest unconditional end which however continues to be duty consists in this that virtue is its own end and by deserving well of men is also its own reward herein it shines so brightly as an 0 ideal that to human perceptions it seems to cast in the shade even holiness itself which is never tempted to transgression this however is an illusion arising from the fact that as we have no measure for the degree of strength except the greatness of the obstacles which might have been overcome which in our case are the inclinations we are led to mistake the subjective conditions of estimation of a magnitude for the objective conditions of the magnitude in itself but when compared with human ends all of which have their obstacles to be overcome it is true that the worth of virtue itself which is its own end far outweighs the worth of all the utility and all the empirical ends and advantages which it may have as consequences we may indeed say that man is obliged to virtue as a moral strength for although the power facultas to overcome all opposing sensible impulses by virtue of his freedom can and must be presupposed yet this power regarded as strength robur is something that must be acquired by the moral spring the idea of the law being elevated by contemplation of the dignity of the pure law of reason in us and at the same time also by exercise 0 xi —according to the preceding principles the scheme of duties of virtue may be thus exhibited the material element of the duty of virtue external duty of virtue the formal element of the duty of virtue internal duty of virtue xii —preliminary notions of the susceptibility of the mind for notions of duty generally these are such moral qualities as when a man does not possess them he is not bound to acquire them they are the moral feeling conscience love of ones neighbour and respect for ourselves selfesteem there is no obligation to have these since they are subjective conditions of susceptibility for the notion of duty not objective conditions of morality they are all sensitive and antecedent but natural capacities of mind prædisposito to be affected by notions of duty capacities which it can not be 0 regarded as a duty to have but which every man has and by virtue of which he can be brought under obligation the consciousness of them is not of empirical origin but can only follow on that of a moral law as an effect of the same on the mind a —the moral feeling this is the susceptibility for pleasure or displeasure merely from the consciousness of the agreement or disagreement of our action with the law of duty now every determination of the elective will proceeds from the idea of the possible action through the feeling of pleasure or displeasure in taking an interest in it or its effect to the deed and here the sensitive state the affection of the internal sense is either a pathological or a moral feeling the former is the feeling that precedes the idea of the law the latter that which may follow it now it can not be a duty to have a moral feeling or to acquire it for all consciousness of obligation supposes this feeling in order that one may become conscious of the necessitation that lies in the notion of duty but every man as a moral being has it originally in himself the obligation then can only extend to the cultivation of it and the strengthening of it even by admiration of its inscrutable origin and this is effected by showing how it is just by the mere conception of reason that it is excited most strongly in its own purity and apart from every pathological stimulus and it is improper to call this feeling a moral sense for the word sense generally means a theoretical power of perception directed to an object whereas the moral feeling like pleasure and displeasure in general is something merely subjective which supplies no knowledge no man is wholly destitute of moral feeling for if he were totally unsusceptible of this sensation he would be morally dead and to speak in the language of physicians if the moral vital force could no longer produce any effect on this feeling then his humanity would be dissolved as it were by chemical laws into mere animality and be irrevocably confounded with the mass of other physical beings but we have no special sense for moral good and evil any more than for truth although such expressions are often used but we have a susceptibility of the free elective will for being moved by pure practical reason and its law and it is this that we call the moral feeling b —of conscience similarly conscience is not a thing to be acquired and it is not a duty to acquire it but every man as a moral being has it originally within him to be bound to have a conscience would be as much as to say to be under a duty to recognise duties for conscience is practical reason which in every case of law holds before a man his duty for acquittal or condemnation consequently it does not refer to an object but only to the subject affecting
